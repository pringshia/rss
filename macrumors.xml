		<description><![CDATA[Game emulator <a href="https://deltaemulatorapp.com/ipad/">Delta</a>, which has been a hit among retro gaming enthusiasts on iPhone, is now officially available for iPad, following an app update to version 1.6.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/delta-emulator-ipad.jpg" alt="" width="1536" height="866" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-958693" /><br/>
Delta has been hugely popular since its debut on the App Store and the emulator has been a constant presence in the Top Charts, with users flocking to play retro games that originally appeared on NES, SNES, N64, Nintendo DS, Game Boy, and Game Boy Advance.<br/>
<br/>
With iPad support in v1.6, users can now take full advantage of the device's larger display and play in fullscreen. There are new controller skins designed specifically for iPad, and the app supports multiple windows in Stage Manager and Split View, with games able to optionally pause when switching windows. The iPad version also supports external game controllers, and the developer Riley Testut says emulated games "hand off" seamlessly between iPhone and iPad, allowing gamers to continue playing where they left off. <br/>
<br/>
Testut says the need for BIOS files has now been eliminated, streamlining the setup process. Users should also notice a considerable improvement in the performance of DS games. The update introduces various menu button gestures, providing more intuitive navigation options. An experimental feature, "Reverse Controller Skin Screens," has also been added, allowing users to switch controller skin screens at runtime, offering greater customization and flexibility during gameplay.<br/>
<br/>
Testut previously explained that Delta for iPad had not originally been a development priority because the plan was to limit the emulator's launch to the EU via alternative app marketplace AltStore PAL, which doesn't support iPad.<br/>
<br/>
However, in a reversal of a years-old policy, Apple in April decided to allow retro game emulators on the ‌App Store‌. Delta was therefore made available on the App Store as a free download in the United States and other countries, with users supporting the developer via <a href="https://www.patreon.com/rileyshane?utm_source=search">Patreon</a>. Official download links for the latest version can be found on the <a href="https://deltaemulatorapp.com/ipad/">Delta website</a>.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/14/popular-delta-retro-game-emulator-ipad/">Popular Delta Retro Game Emulator Officially Comes to iPad</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/popular-delta-retro-game-emulator-officially-comes-to-ipad.2431316/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Samsung <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/10/samsung-galaxy-z-fold6-flip6/">this week introduced</a> its latest earbuds, the <a href="https://howl.me/cmDIUN6mU8k">Galaxy Buds3 Pro</a>, which look quite a bit like Apple's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/">AirPods Pro</a> 2. Given the similarities, we thought we'd compare Samsung's new earbuds to the &zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe title="Galaxy Buds3 Pro vs AirPods Pro" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/I_aTHWKmo9c" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe><em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/macrumors?sub_confirmation=1">Subscribe to the MacRumors YouTube channel</a> for more videos.</em></div><br/>
Design wise, you could potentially mistake Samsung's Galaxy Buds3 Pro for the &zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj;. The Buds3 Pro have the same general shape and a silicone tip, though it's worth noting that the Buds3 Pro come in both white and gray, so you're not limited to white as you are with the &zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj; 2. The charging case is similar to the AirPods Charging Case too, but there's a transparent upper portion.<br/>
<br/>
The Buds3 Pro sound great out of the box, but there is an option to adjust the sound using the equalizer, which isn't possible with the &zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj; 2. The Active Noise Cancellation and the "Ambient Mode" or transparency on the Buds3 Pro work as well as those features on the &zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj;, and it's tough to tell the difference between them.<br/>
<br/>
Samsung's Buds3 Pro do not perform as well as the &zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj; when it comes to ambient noise detection to adjust sound, however. The &zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj; can adjust sound when someone is speaking to you so you can hear them, but the Buds3 Pro struggled to do the same.<br/>
<br/>
The Buds3 Pro have a built-in LED light for aesthetics, and there are controls on the stem for adjusting volume. Samsung also added an interpreter mode for translating foreign languages when connected to the most recent Galaxy phones, but the feature wasn't super accurate.<br/>
<br/>
Though the Buds3 Pro are similar to the &zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj; 2, it's hard to see the two as competitors because you're only going to want to use the Buds3 Pro with Android devices, while the &zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj; 2 work best with Apple devices. <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> users should stick with the AirPods, while Samsung users will want to check out the Buds3 Pro.<br/>
<br/>
Samsung's Galaxy Buds3 Pro <a href="https://howl.me/cmDIUN6mU8k">are priced at &#36;250</a>, which is the same price as the &zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj; 2. Pre-orders are available now ahead of a July 24 launch date.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/samsung/">Samsung</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/13/airpods-pro-2-vs-galaxy-buds3-pro/">Apple&#039;s AirPods Pro 2 vs. Samsung&#039;s Galaxy Buds3 Pro</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apples-airpods-pro-2-vs-samsungs-galaxy-buds3-pro.2431266/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Amazon is soon to be back with its annual <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Famazonprime">summertime Prime Day event</a>, lasting for just two days from July 16-17. As it does every year, Prime Day offers shoppers a huge selection of deals across Amazon's storefront, and there are already many deals you can get on sale ahead of the event.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/10/primeday2020_feature3.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-763521" /><em><small>Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with Amazon. When you click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment, which helps us keep the site running.</small></em><br/>
<br/>
For our coverage, we're focusing entirely on early discounts for Apple and Apple-related products that can be purchased right now on Amazon. As of today, this includes deals on AirPods, Apple Watch, iPad, MacBook Air, and more. We're also sharing deals being matched at retailers like Best Buy in some cases.<br/>
<br/>
As is typical for Prime Day deals, these markdowns are very time sensitive, so sales listed below may disappear fast, and new ones may appear even faster. With this in mind, we'll keep this article updated over the next few days, and keep an eye on the MacRumors front page as we'll be posting particularly great deals in separate articles next week.<br/>
<br/>
Lastly, and perhaps most importantly, Amazon Prime Day requires you to have an <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Famazonprime"><strong>Amazon Prime membership</strong></a> to take advantage of the discounts. Amazon Prime costs &#36;14.99 per month or &#36;139.00 per year, and it comes with a 30-day free trial for new subscribers.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Apple Watch</h2><br/>

<h2>M2 iPad Pro</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/m2-ipad-pro-prime-day.jpg" alt="" width="2002" height="1126" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-958610" /><br/>
<br/>
Over at Best Buy, today you can find some of the biggest discounts on the M2 11-inch and 12.9-inch iPad Pro that we've seen in months, including both Wi-Fi and cellular tablets. A My Best Buy Plus/Total membership is not required to see these discounts.<br/>
<br/>
With such steep savings, these previous generation iPad Pros are worth looking into purchasing for anyone who wants to prioritize saving money over owning the newest M4 iPad Pro. There are some major differences between the two generations, like the M4's support for Apple Pencil Pro and a new nano-texture display option, so be sure to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ipad-pro-2022-vs-2024/">read about which one works best for you</a> in our Buyer's Guide.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple is moving right along with development and testing on iOS 18 and related software updates, with the third developer betas arriving this past week and public beta versions of most of them expected very shortly.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/top-stories-13jul2024.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-958642" /><br/>
Not all of the new features Apple showed off at WWDC last month will be available right away, however, with some rolling out in later iOS 18 updates over the next year. In particular, significant Siri enhancements with Apple Intelligence are reportedly slated for iOS 18.4 in the spring of 2025. Other news this week included hints of a touchscreen-equipped HomePod and rumors about the next-generation Apple Watch SE, so read on below for all the details!<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Everything New in iOS 18 Beta 3</h2><br/>
Apple this week <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/08/apple-seeds-ios-18-beta-3/">seeded the third beta of iOS 18</a> to developers for testing, and there are a handful of new features and changes. Check out our list of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/08/everything-new-ios-18-beta-3/">everything new in iOS 18 beta 3</a>, including Dark Mode for additional app icons, tweaks to the Photos app, and more.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/iOS-18-on-iPhone-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-955605" /><br/>
Apple also seeded the third betas of iPadOS 18, macOS Sequoia, watchOS 11, tvOS 18, visionOS 2, and more.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>iOS 18 Public Beta Coming Soon: How to Get Your iPhone Ready</h2><br/>
Apple last month announced that the first public beta of iOS 18 would be released in July, so it <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/09/ios-18-public-beta-coming-soon/">should be available to try out soon</a>. The first public betas of iOS 17 and iOS 16 were both released in the first half of July over the past two years, so it is possible that the iOS 18 public beta will be available next week.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/iOS-18-Public-Beta-Thumb-3.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-958425" /><br/>
Ahead of time, read our story outlining <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/09/ios-18-public-beta-coming-soon/">how to get your iPhone ready for the iOS 18 public beta</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>New Siri Experience With Apple Intelligence Likely to Debut in Spring 2025</h2><br/>
While some Apple Intelligence features will be available when iOS 18, iPadOS 18, and macOS Sequoia are first released to the public later this year, Apple last month said that some of the remaining features will be rolled out "over the course of the next year." <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/Apple-Intelligence-General-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-956491" /><br/>
According to <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman, a smarter version of Siri powered by Apple Intelligence <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/07/new-siri-experience-to-debut-spring-2025/">will likely launch as part of iOS 18.4 in the spring of 2025</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>tvOS 18 Hints at HomePod With Touchscreen Display</h2><br/>
A reference to an unreleased HomePod with a built-in screen has <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/09/tvos18-homepod-touchscreen-display/">allegedly been uncovered in the tvOS 18 beta</a>, following earlier reports that <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/05/the-macrumors-show-apples-next-big-thing-robots/">Apple plans to release such a device</a> in the future.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/05/HomePod-With-Screen-and-Arm-FaceTime-Feature-2.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-801481" /><em>MacRumors concept mockups based on early rumors</em></div><br/>
Apple is rumored to have been prototyping <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/04/leak-confirms-apples-work-on-home-accessory/">several different smart home accessories</a>, including a HomePod with a screen, a smart home hub with a robotic arm, a device that combines a HomePod and Apple TV, and more, but it is unclear if or when all of them will be released to the public.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Apple Reportedly Developing Apple Watch SE With Plastic Casing</h2><br/>
Apple is developing a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/07/apple-watch-se-with-plastic-casing/">next-generation version of the low-end Apple Watch SE with a plastic casing</a>, according to <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/09/apple-watch-se-2022.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-866330" /><br/>
A third-generation Apple Watch SE is expected to be released in September, but it is unclear if Apple will move forward with the plastic casing, which would replace the aluminum casing on previous models. The current Apple Watch SE starts at &#36;249 in the U.S., and the move to plastic could allow for the next model to have an even lower starting price.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>10+ Changes to Control Center in iOS 18</h2><br/>
Apple is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ios-18-control-center/">significantly overhauling Control Center on iOS 18</a> for the first time since iOS 11, with greater customization, multiple pages, additional controls, and more. Apple also now allows users to customize the Flashlight and Camera shortcuts on the Lock Screen.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/iOS-18-Control-Center-Guide-1.jpg" alt="" width="2100" height="1180" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-958438" /><br/>
Check out our list outlining <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ios-18-control-center/">more than 10 new features and changes in Control Center on iOS 18</a>, which will be widely released later this year for the iPhone XS and newer.<br/>

When a Highlight is available on a webpage, you'll see a small purple sparkle over the tool icon in the browser bar, along with a quick flash to the Highlight data that's available. If you tap on the icon with the sparkle, Safari will show you key website information like location, hours, and directions.<br/>
<br/>
Information that's shown in Highlights will depend on the website you're visiting. For stores, hotels, and other places you might want to go to, Safari will provide directions. For other websites, you might see links to learn more about people, music, movies, and TV shows.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/ios-18-safari-highlights.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-958672" /><br/>
Highlights is available in U.S. English at the current time, and as &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj; is in beta, this feature is not available on all websites. Highlights can be disabled by opening up the Safari section of the Settings app and toggling it off. <br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="reader_mode">Reader Mode</h2><br/>
Safari updated Reader Mode to provide a table of contents for long articles and also a quick summary of what's on the page.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/ios-18-safari-reader-mode.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-958666" /><br/>
The new Reader Mode features give users a way to get to a specific part of an article as well as an overview of what's in an article in order to decide whether it's worth continuing to read.<br/>
<br/>
New Reader Mode options are available in English (Australia), English (Canada), English (Ireland), English (New Zealand), English (South Africa), English (UK), and English (U.S.)<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="design_changes">Design Changes</h2><br/>
Apple updated the design of the Safari tools that can be accessed through the URL bar. The tool icon is now a box with two lines, and tapping it brings you into full overlay window that's at the bottom of the display.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/ios-18-safari-design-changes.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-958667" /><br/>
Not all tools are displayed at once anymore, with Apple prioritizing those people might want most like translate, Reader Mode, Privacy Protections, and font size. Tapping on the ellipsis at the bottom of the interface shows the rest of the Safari settings like Show IP Address, Request Desktop Website, and Hide Toolbar.<br/>
<br/>
Apple has also changed the design of the tab management page, with a unified toolbar for separate sections and tab groups. <br/>
<br/>
<h3 id="new_quick_access_options">New Quick Access Options</h3><br/>
Some of the features that used to be tucked away in the Share Sheet are now more readily available through the Safari toolbar.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/ios-18-safari-menu-options.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-958671" /><br/>
New options include the following:<br/>
<ul><br/>
 <li>Print</li><br/>
 <li>Add to Favorites</li><br/>
 <li>Add Bookmark</li><br/>
 <li>Add to Quick Note</li><br/>
 <li>Add to Reading List</li><br/>
 <li>Move to Tab Group</li><br/>
 <li>Pin Tab</li><br/>
 <li>Camera Access</li><br/>
 <li>Microphone Access</li><br/>
 <li>Location Access</li><br/>
 <li>Open Links in Profile</li><br/>
</ul><br/>
The Page Menu can be edited so that you can customize which tools go in your list of favorites for quicker access.<br/>
<br/>
All of these options are still available through the Share Sheet as well.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="passwords">Passwords</h2><br/>
With a new dedicated Passwords app, Safari logins, passwords, and passkeys are filled in automatically if you have your information saved to the app.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/ios-18-passwords-app.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-957056" /><br/>
The Passwords app has the same functionality as the Passwords section in the Settings app, it's simply been split out into a standalone app for easier access. Safari can automatically save login and password information to the Passwords app, and everything syncs cross-device. Passwords can even be accessed on Windows PCs.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="locked_apps">Locked Apps</h2><br/>
Apps like Safari can be locked and hidden, requiring <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mask-face-id/">Face ID</a> or <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/touch-id/">Touch ID</a> authentication to access them. Locking an app goes a step further than the protected private browsing feature that Apple introduced in an earlier version of iOS, as the entire Safari browser can be locked.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/ios-18-locked-apps.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-958673" /><br/>
To open a locked app, you need to authenticate, so someone who has your unlocked phone still won't be able to see your browser if you lock Safari. Hiding an app locks it and removes it from the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/home-screen/">Home Screen</a>, tucking it away in a secret Hidden apps folder in the App Library.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple CEO <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tim-cook/">Tim Cook</a> and Apple Software and Services chief <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/eddy-cue/">Eddy Cue</a> <a href="https://www.reuters.com/pictures/media-mogul-style-sun-valleys-summer-camp-billionaires-2024-07-11/">are attending</a> the annual Sun Valley Conference in Sun Valley, Idaho, this weekend. The media finance conference is well-known for attracting some of the biggest names in tech.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/reuters-tim-cook-sun-valley-event.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1280" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-958647" /><div class="center-wrap"><em><a href="https://www.reuters.com/pictures/media-mogul-style-sun-valleys-summer-camp-billionaires-2024-07-11/">Image via Reuters</a></em></div><br/>
<br/>
The Sun Valley Conference has been likened to a camp for billionaires, where tech and media moguls can negotiate deals while golfing, whitewater rafting, and similar activities. Cook and Cue <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/07/03/tim-cook-2022-sun-valley-conference-guest-list/">are both regulars</a> at the event.<br/>
<br/>
Other attendees this year include Amazon's Jeff Bezos, Oprah Winfrey, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, Bill Gates, Salesforce CEO Mark Benioff, Nike CEO John Donahoe, Sony CEO Ken Yoshida, YouTube CEO Neal Mohan, SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son, Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, and Disney CEO Bob Iger.<br/>
<br/>
The Sun Valley event is invite-only and members of the media have limited access, so the deals and relationships that originate at the event often go undocumented.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tim-cook/">Tim Cook</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/eddy-cue/">Eddy Cue</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/12/tim-cook-sun-valley-2024/">Apple CEO Tim Cook and Software Chief Eddy Cue Attend Sun Valley Conference</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-ceo-tim-cook-and-software-chief-eddy-cue-attend-sun-valley-conference.2431225/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple recently shared Suerte, a new short film that was shot entirely on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a>. The film follows singer-songwriter Iván Cornejo, known for albums Alma Vacía, Dañado, and Mirada.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe title="Shot on iPhone 15 Pro ¡Suerte! Apple" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dexkYvIch3s" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div><br/>
In the film, Cornejo goes on a journey to Mexico to seek inspiration from his roots for a new hit, and he ends up on a great adventure. His song "Intercambio Injusto" is included, and there is a soundtrack for the film <a href="https://music.apple.com/us/playlist/suerte/pl.58ca7a21232544cc941f07aabbaf13a6">available on Apple Music</a>.<br/>
<br/>
The &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; Max is Apple's current flagship <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>, featuring a 48-megapixel Main camera, a 12-megapixel Telephoto camera, and a 12-megapixel Telephoto camera with tetraprism technology that allows for up to 5x optical zoom. Apple also shared a "Behind the Scenes" film for Suerte, where directing duo Cliqua explains how it was shot.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe title="Shot on iPhone 15 Pro The making of " src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zF6pTNSGph4" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div><br/>
Many of the scenes in the film used no equipment other than the &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; Max, with the directors praising Cinematic Mode, a feature that keeps the focus on the main subject that's being filmed even as the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; holder moves. The 5x Telephoto zoom feature was also used for several shots, as was log encoding, an option for ProRes video that allows for improved post-production color grading.<br/>
<br/>
Apple has a long history of sharing Shot on &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; photos and videos to show off the features of the cameras in its devices. In recent years, as camera technology has improved, Apple has been sharing short films on a regular basis.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/shot-on-iphone/">Shot on iPhone</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/12/apple-shot-on-iphone-suerte/">Apple Shares &#039;Suerte&#039; Shot on iPhone 15 Pro Max Short Film</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-shares-suerte-shot-on-iphone-15-pro-max-short-film.2431223/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[For this week's giveaway, we've teamed up with <a href="https://www.lululook.com">Lululook</a> to offer <em>MacRumors</em> readers a chance to win an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch-ultra/">Apple Watch Ultra 2</a> and a <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FLULULOOK-Wireless-Foldable-Charging-Aluminum%2Fdp%2FB0CGVFKM5M%2F">Lululook 3-in-1 Charger</a> to go along with it.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/lululook-3-in-1-charger-1.jpg" alt="" width="1765" height="993" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-958632" /><br/>
Lululook has a range of Apple device charging options, and the &#36;65 <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FLULULOOK-Wireless-Foldable-Charging-Aluminum%2Fdp%2FB0CGVFKM5M%2F">3-in-1 Wireless Charger</a> can charge an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>, Apple Watch, and AirPods at the same time, so it's a useful desktop or nightstand charger.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/lululook-3-in-1-charger-2.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="2000" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-958633" /><br/>
Available in gray, black, and silver, the charger is made from aluminum so it matches well with Apple devices. When not in use, it folds down into a compact cube shape, which is ideal for travel. The &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; attaches to the charger magnetically, but note that charging is limited to 7.5W as this is not <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe-battery-pack/">MagSafe</a> or Qi2.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/lululook-3-in-1-charger-3.jpg" alt="" width="1940" height="1200" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-958634" /><br/>
The Apple Watch charger is 5W so it can fast charge an Apple Watch, and there is an additional 5W charger for the AirPods and other devices. It also comes with a USB-C to USB-C cable for powering it, but you'll need to supply a power adapter.<br/>
<br/>
If you only need to charge an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; and Apple Watch, Lululook also has a <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FLULULOOK-Foldable-Wireless-Portable-Charging%2Fdp%2FB0CDWNNBC4%2F%3Fth%3D1">foldable 2-in-1 Wireless Charger</a> for just &#36;36. The 2-in-1 Charger has the same design as the 3-in-1 model, but with only two foldable platforms rather than three. It too is able to fast charge the Apple Watch and charge an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; at 7.5W.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/lululook-2-in-1-charger-2.jpg" alt="" width="1700" height="1256" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-958635" /><br/>
Along with chargers, Lululook has a selection of Apple Watch bands for the Apple Watch Ultra and other devices. The <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FLULULOOK-Original-Fluoroelastomer-Wristband-Replacement%2Fdp%2FB0D3V37G87%2F">&#36;40 fluoroelastomer band</a> is similar to Apple's Sport Band, but it is available in a range of fun colors, including glow-in-the-dark. It is ideal for sports and similar activities because it is washable, sweat resistant, and breathable.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/lululook-titanium-band-1.jpg" alt="" width="1500" height="842" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-958636" /><br/>
Lululook has a <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FLULULOOK-Titanium-Adjustable-Smartwatch-Resistant%2Fdp%2FB0D5YF5PTX%2F">&#36;120 Titanium Magnetic Band</a> for those who want a band made from the same material that the Apple Watch is made from, and an <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FLULULOOK-Titanium-Magnetic-Resistant-Size-Lightweight%2Fdp%2FB0CTJKC7G5%2F">upgraded luxury version for &#36;300</a>. The higher-end model is made from Titanium Grade 4, so it is lightweight, comfortable, and durable. It has a double magnetic buckle and a super scratch resistant coating.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/lululook-titanium-band-2.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-958637" /><br/>

		<description><![CDATA[On this week's episode of <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/podcast/samsungs-latest-challenge-to-apple/id1602394741?i=1000662035949">The MacRumors Show</a>, we discuss all of the major new device announcements from <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/10/samsung-galaxy-z-fold6-flip6/">Samsung's 2024 Galaxy Unpacked event</a> and how they compare to Apple's offerings.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GmsPu_ZoYqk?si=U9FmRzNmt7vtux0I" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@themacrumorsshow?sub_confirmation=1">Subscribe to The MacRumors Show YouTube channel</a> for more videos</em></div><br/>
The Galaxy Z Fold6 features a 7.6-inch main screen and a 6.3-inch cover display, both enhanced with a new dual-rail hinge and Corning Gorilla Glass Victus 2 for improved durability. It features the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 chip and includes AI-powered tools like new camera capabilities and on-device language translation. The Galaxy Z Flip6, with its compact form factor, also sports a more durable display, a new camera system with a 50MP wide sensor, and various AI features.<br/>
<br/>
The Galaxy Buds3 and Buds3 Pro earbuds adopt a stem design reminiscent of Apple's AirPods. The Galaxy Buds3 offer active noise cancellation and maintain an open-ear design, while the Galaxy Buds3 Pro include advanced features like adaptive noise control, built-in lights for visual cues, and real-time audio translation. Both models are designed to provide optimized audio quality through internal and external sound analysis. Just like Samsung, Apple is expected to bring active noise cancellation to its standard AirPods later this year.<br/>
<br/>
Samsung's smartwatch lineup is refreshed with the Galaxy Watch7, available in 40mm and 44mm sizes. The Galaxy Watch7 is powered by a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/3nm/">3nm</a> processor, offering enhanced performance and power efficiency. It includes dual-frequency GPS for improved location accuracy and advanced health tracking capabilities, along with new gesture controls. While Apple is rumored to bring sleep apnea detection to the Apple Watch later this year, with the Galaxy Watch7, Samsung has beaten Apple to deliver the feature first. <br/>
<br/>
The Galaxy Watch Ultra is Samsung's new high-end smartwatch, designed for durability and extreme conditions, making it suitable for athletes and adventurers. It features a titanium frame, water resistance up to 100 meters, and the ability to function at a wide range of altitudes. With a battery life of up to 100 hours in power-saving mode, the Watch Ultra includes multi-course workout tracking, advanced heart rate monitoring, and an emergency siren. Its design and feature-set largely mirrors that of the Apple Watch Ultra.<br/>
<br/>
Finally, Samsung introduced the Galaxy Ring, a health-focused wearable designed to track a variety of metrics, including sleep, heart rate, and skin temperature. Made of titanium and available in nine sizes, the Galaxy Ring offers up to seven days of battery life and does not require a subscription for accessing health data. It provides comprehensive health insights with features like sleep scoring and an overall energy score, and it closely integrates with other Samsung devices.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Hackers broke into a cloud platform used by AT&T and accessed the phone records of "nearly all" of its cellular customers, AT&T <a href="https://www.att.com/support/article/my-account/000102979">announced</a> on Friday.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/ATT-Banner.jpeg" alt="" width="1200" height="630" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-937556" /><br/>
AT&T said the stolen data contains phone numbers of both cellular and landline customers, as well as AT&T records of calls and text messages across a six-month period between May 1, 2022 and October 31, 2022. <br/>
<br/>
AT&T said some of the stolen data includes more recent records from January 2, 2023 for a smaller, unspecified number of customers, as well as call records of customers with other cellular carriers that rely on AT&T's network.<br/>
<br/>
Some of the records include cell site identification numbers linked to calls and texts, which can be used to work out the approximate location of where a call was made or message sent.<br/>
<br/>
The downloaded data doesn't include the content of any calls or texts, or their time stamps, according to AT&T. It also doesn't have any details such as Social Security numbers, dates of birth, or other personally identifiable information.<br/>
<br/>
AT&T said it learned of the data breach on April 19, and that it is unrelated to an earlier security incident in March. The company said it does not believe the data is publicly available at this time, and it continues to work with law enforcement to identify and apprehend those involved. At least one person is said to have been arrested.<br/>
<br/>
AT&T told <em><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/07/12/att-phone-records-stolen-data-breach/">TechCrunch</a></em> that the most recent compromise of customer records were stolen from the cloud data giant Snowflake during a recent spate of data thefts targeting Snowflake's customers. Other companies that have confirmed stolen data from Snowflake include Ticketmaster, QuoteWizard, and others.<br/>
<br/>
Cybersecurity researchers from incident response firm Mandiant say the hacker group is mostly based in the US and those involved are financially motivated. <br/>
<br/>
AT&T customers concerned about phishing and smishing scams should visit the company's <a href="https://www.att.com/support/article/my-account/000102979">support article</a>, which also includes advice on how to protect yourself from online fraud.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/12/hackers-steal-att-phone-records/">Hackers Steal Phone Records of &#039;Nearly All&#039; AT&amp;T Customers</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/hackers-steal-phone-records-of-nearly-all-at-t-customers.2431183/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's Vision Pro spatial computing headset today arrived at <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-store/">Apple Store</a> locations in the United Kingdom, Canada, France, Germany, and Australia. The device was previously only available in Hong Kong, Japan, Singapore, mainland China, and the United States.<br/>
<br/>

Consumer interest in the &#36;3,499 headset has slowed at home, and Apple will be hoping its new availability in international markets will provide a shot in the arm for ailing sales. The headset has yet to sell 100,000 units in the quarter since it launched in the U.S. in February, according to market tracker IDC.<br/>
<br/>
Apple's first-ever mixed reality headset offers both augmented and virtual reality features, and it is controlled with a combination of your eyes, hands, and voice. Overall, the feedback on the Vision Pro has been varied. Many users appreciate the device's advanced hardware and technology. <br/>
<br/>
However, there are concerns regarding its functionality, the ease of use of the gesture-based controls, and the device's weight and comfort during extended use. Additionally, the general application of VR technology and the limited content available for the device have drawn criticism.<br/>
<br/>
Apple Stores are offering customers free Vision Pro demos on a first-come, first-served basis. It is also possible to reserve a <a href="https://www.apple.com/uk/retail/instore-shopping-session">Vision Pro demo online</a>, with slots available over the course of the next week.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AppleVisionPro">Vision Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-vision-pro.209">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/12/apple-vision-pro-launched-uk-canada-france-germany/">Apple Vision Pro Launches in UK, Canada, France, Germany, and Australia</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-vision-pro-launches-in-uk-canada-france-germany-and-australia.2431178/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The USB-C <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-pencil/">Apple Pencil</a> that was launched in November 2023 is now available <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/FUWA3AM/A/refurbished-apple-pencil-usb-c">from the Apple Refurbished Store</a> in the United States and Canada at a discount. Refurbished USB-C &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; models are available for &#36;69 in the U.S., which is &#36;10 off of the standard &#36;79 price. In Canada, the refurbished USB-C &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; is available for &#36;89, down from &#36;109.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/Apple-Pencil-USB-C-sliding-cap-feature.jpg" alt="" width="1960" height="1102" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-917176" /><br/>
Apple first began offering refurbished versions of the USB-C &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/08/refurbished-usb-c-apple-pencil/">earlier this week</a>, but the discounted device was limited to European countries like Austria, Belgium, Germany, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland, Spain, Switzerland, and the UK. It has now expanded to additional countries.<br/>
<br/>
The USB-C &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; was introduced in October 2023, shipping out to customers in November. It is similar in design to the &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; 2, but it has a sliding cap with a USB-C port for charging because it is unable to charge magnetically.<br/>
<br/>
To keep the price low, Apple did not include features like Double Tap and pressure sensitivity in the USB-C &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj;, but it does support tilt functionality and &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; hover. As for compatibility, it works with USB-C iPads that run iOS 17.1 or later.<br/>
<br/>
Apple says that refurbished products like the USB-C &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; undergo fully functionality testing, as well as cleaning and repackaging. Refurbished &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; USB-C models include the same one-year limited warranty as new models.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-refurbished/">Apple Refurbished Products</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/11/refurbished-usb-c-apple-pencil-us/">Refurbished USB-C Apple Pencil Now Available in U.S. and Canada</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/refurbished-usb-c-apple-pencil-now-available-in-u-s-and-canada.2431162/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[If you've been following Apple news and rumors for the last decade, you might remember The Unofficial Apple Weblog, or TUAW. TUAW <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/01/30/aohell/">was shut down</a> and the site was folded into <em>Engadget</em> way back in 2015, but this month, a zombie TUAW website reappeared.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/tuaw-website.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-958574" /><br/>
As it turns out, the TUAW domain name was purchased by a Hong Kong-based advertising agency, and it now hosts stolen content rewritten using AI. TUAW started posting AI-generated content earlier this week, with all of it stolen from sites like <em>MacRumors</em> and <em>9to5Mac</em>.<br/>
<br/>
The new TUAW website takes articles from Apple news sites and runs them through AI to change the wording. There are multiple stolen images that have been lifted from <em>MacRumors</em> for these articles, with the graphics used created by our in-house graphic designer. Shortly after we published <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/05/iphone-17-slim-everything-we-know/">an iPhone 17 "Slim" overview</a>, for example, TUAW published an <a href="https://www.tuaw.com/2024/07/05/iphone-17-slim/">almost identical article</a> that uses our stolen imagery and reads like it was run through a thesaurus.<br/>
<br/>
The company that bought TUAW also shamelessly used the names of people who worked at the site many years ago for author bylines, which meant this stolen content looked like it was coming from people <a href="https://mastodon.social/@film_girl/112758216249922551">like Christina Warren</a> and Brett Terpstra.<br/>
<br/>
Warren was able to get her name and the names of other prominent writers removed after publicizing the zombie site on Mastodon, but the AI content remains. TUAW changed the Christina Warren byline on its site to Mary Brown, making other similar generic name changes. There are no actual writers at TUAW, just AI-generated images and biographies to go along with the AI content.<br/>
<br/>
The advertising agency that purchased the TUAW domain name (Web Orange Limited) did not purchase any TUAW content, but went back and generated AI-rewritten versions of archived TUAW articles from archive.org. Thousands of these articles are on the site alongside newly generated AI stories.<br/>
<br/>
It is worth noting that the company that bought the TUAW domain name also purchased the iLounge domain name several years ago and resurrected that site with low-quality content.<br/>
<br/>
<em><a href="https://tidbits.com/2024/07/11/tuaw-joins-ilounge-as-an-ai-powered-zombie-site/">TidBITS</a></em>, <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/10/24195858/tuaw-unofficial-apple-tech-blog-ai-web-orange-khan">The Verge</a></em>, <em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-blog-tuaw-returns-as-an-ai-content-farm-225326136.html">Engadget</a></em>, <em><a href="https://www.404media.co/a-beloved-tech-blog-tuaw-is-now-publishing-ai-articles-under-the-names-of-its-old-human-staff/">404Media</a></em>, and other sites have done deep dives into TUAW and the company behind it that are worth checking out. TUAW's owner does not appear to be based in the United States, and it's unclear if TUAW will be taken down even with legal complaints.<br/>
<br/>
Readers of <em>MacRumors</em>, <em>9to5Mac</em>, and other tech sites will want to avoid TUAW going forward. As <em>TidBITS</em> points out, Google is a major factor in what's going on with TUAW because it isn't de-incentivizing AI-generated content, even on a site where it's almost all AI content. TUAW articles are showing up on the first page of search results alongside legitimate tech sites.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/11/tuaw-stolen-graphics-ai-content/">Apple Blog TUAW Returns With Stolen Graphics and AI-Generated Content</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-blog-tuaw-returns-with-stolen-graphics-and-ai-generated-content.2431156/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple CEO <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tim-cook/">Tim Cook</a> uses the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a> every day, according to an interview he did with <em><a href="https://www.the-sun.com/tech/11893606/apple-vision-pro-tim-cook-interview/">The Sun</a></em> to highlight the headset's launch in the UK. Cook said that he uses the Vision Pro "in all aspects of [his] daily life."<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/Apple-Vision-Pro-with-battery-Feature-Blue-Magenta.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-898550" /><br/>
For specifics, Cook said he used the headset to watch Ted Lasso season three, and that he also watches other <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-tv-plus/">Apple TV+</a> content using the headset.<blockquote>And so the ability for me to get in the position that I want to get in – including lying flat and putting the screen on the ceiling – is an incredible kind of experience. And of course, it's a 100ft screen. I mean, it's amazing the level of entertainment that it delivers.</blockquote>Cook went on to say that he feels multitasking is "so much more efficient" on Vision Pro because of the support for multiple windows that can be placed in the wearer's physical space.<br/>
<br/>
The Vision Pro experience is hard to explain, said Cook, who recommended that potential customers get a demo. "It's hard to explain it in words," Cook said. "It's hard to show it in a 2D fashion, what a 3D experience will be." At the same time, Cook believes it's simple to use the headset with the gestures that work "the way your mind works." If you can use an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>, you can "very easily" use Vision Pro, according to Cook.<br/>
<br/>
According to Cook, some who go through the demo experience find it to be emotional, specifically in reference to viewing spatial photos and videos that allow users to relive memories. "It's interesting to watch people, the reaction that they have," he said. "You know many of them tear up."<br/>
<br/>
Designing the &zwnj;Apple Vision Pro&zwnj; required Apple to file more than 5,000 patents, Cook explained, before lauding the Vision Pro team. "I'm so proud of the total, and the perseverance of the team because this was multiple years in the making."<br/>
<br/>
Cook's full interview <a href="https://www.the-sun.com/tech/11893606/apple-vision-pro-tim-cook-interview/">can be read at <em>The Sun</em>'s website</a>.

		<description><![CDATA[With Qi2 chargers hitting the market in increasing numbers, I've recently spent some time testing out two similar "tree-style" 3-in-1 desktop chargers from Anker and Belkin. 3-in-1 chargers like these, which are capable of charging an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>, and Apple Watch, and another device such as AirPods, all wirelessly, have been my go-to bedside charger style ever since the introduction of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe-battery-pack/">MagSafe</a> and are very popular with users in general, so I thought it would be worthwhile to see how a couple of the latest options perform.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/anker-belkin-qi2-3-in-1-chargers.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-958542" /><em>Anker (left) and Belkin (right) Qi2 3-in-1 chargers</em></div><br/>
Both the <a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=J2shFQg6J/U&mid=43469&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.anker.com%2Fproducts%2Fa25m3-maggo-qi2-wireless-charging-station-magsafe-compatible">Anker MagGo Wireless Charging Station (3-in-1 Stand)</a> and the <a href="https://belkin.evyy.net/9gRV05">Belkin BoostCharge Pro 3-in-1 Magnetic Wireless Charging Stand with Qi2 15W</a> offer 15-watt Qi2 phone charging support that is equivalent to &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; without needing to license or source components from Apple, while official fast-charging pucks are used to ensure maximum Apple Watch charging performance. The base of each model includes a standard 5-watt Qi charging spot, which is plenty to charge up any AirPods model that includes a wireless charging case. Both the Anker and Belkin models are available in black or white with color-matched cables and power adapters. Anker uses a standard USB-C to USB-C cable while Belkin uses a fixed cable that ends in a USB-C connector, so that's potentially something to consider one way or the other for either aesthetics or product longevity.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/belkin-qi2-3-in-1-charger-devices.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-958551" /><br/>
While both chargers utilize a relatively heavy base for stability and as an AirPods charging spot, their "trunk and branches" with elevated charging pads for an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; and an Apple Watch differ slightly in design, with the Belkin model using a forward-angled main support topped by a single horizontal bar with the phone charging pad at one end and the Apple Watch charger at the other, while the Anker model uses an offset vertical trunk with separate phone and Apple Watch charging pads at different heights. The Anker design results in a bit narrower overall profile with an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; and Apple Watch mounted on the chargers, but the Apple Watch can end up somewhat hidden behind the phone in certain configurations such as with the phone in landscape StandBy mode.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/anker-qi2-3-in-1-charger-devices-standby.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-958549" /><br/>
The base on the Belkin model is sort of a flat mound with a small depression to help guide your AirPods to the proper charging spot, while the Anker base is more dish-like with a small rim surrounding a flat top. The AirPods charging spot is a separate component embedded in the surface of the base and it's made of a slightly different material, so you can see the outline of the charger to help guide placement, plus there's a light gray Qi logo in the middle of the charging spot. Neither model offers magnets in this charging spot to help make proper placement even easier.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/anker-qi2-3-in-1-charger-devices.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-958552" /><br/>
Overall, the Belkin design offers significantly more stability for a mounted phone in my experience, as tapping the phone or generating vibrations on the desk surface will cause the phone to wiggle a fair amount while on the Anker charger, but it remains nearly rock steady while on the Belkin charger. If you're planning to use one of these chargers on a desk or other situation where you'll be interacting with the phone while it's charging, this difference alone is enough to argue for the Belkin in my opinion, as the amount of wobble on the Anker charger is significant.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/belkin-qi2-3-in-1-charger.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-958547" /><br/>
Looking at the Qi2 phone charging pad itself, the Belkin version has the advantage of an adjustable angle anywhere between fully vertical and fully horizontal, letting you position it however you prefer. The phone pad on the Anker model is at a fixed angle that should work for most people, but the option of adjustments on the Belkin model is a nice feature. The Belkin phone charger also has an understated look with a plain black or white surface matching the base, while the Anker Qi2 charging surface is white on both the black and white model and it has Qi2 branding and "Wireless Power IQ" text on it that makes for a less clean look.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/anker-qi2-3-in-1-charger.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-958545" /><br/>
Both chargers were able to take an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a> Max from 30% to ~80% in about an hour, pretty much exactly in line with what I see from Apple's official &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; charger. The charging rate starts to slow significantly beyond that to prevent overheating and overcharging, with all three chargers bringing the phone to around 95% after 90 minutes.<br/>
<br/>
When it comes to the Apple Watch charging puck, the Anker and Belkin units are essentially identical, which makes sense considering these parts are sourced from Apple. On both models, the puck itself is white on both black and white color options. I'd love to see some other puck color options from Apple to help third-party manufacturers offer more flexibility in their own color offerings.<br/>
<br/>
Given that these are official Apple Watch modules, they both suffer from one of the common issues some users have complained about with Apple Watch chargers, and that's the fact that the watch has a tendency to rotate while on the charger. While the watch attaches to the charger magnetically, there's nothing offering any rotational stability, so the weight of the watch or band can result in the watch twisting a bit while on the charger.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/anker-qi2-3-in-1-charger-sticker.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-958544" /><br/>
To its credit, Anker has tried to address this by including a sheet of round stickers that can be placed on the surface of the charging puck to increase friction and reduce the watch's tendency to rotate. This solution does work pretty well, but the sticker is a bit of an eyesore with a tab to facilitate removal hanging over the edge of the puck and a plus-shaped cut in the center of the sticker to allow it to conform to the slightly concave surface of the puck.<br/>
<br/>
The tree-style designs of these chargers means neither one supports Nightstand Mode for the Apple Watch, as the support arms for the chargers get in the way of the band when trying to turn the watch horizontally, and even if they didn't, the weight of the band would cause the watch to rotate back to nearly vertical. This may not be a deal-breaker for many users, especially with the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; now offering its own landscape StandBy mode, but it's worth noting.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/belkin-qi2-3-in-1-charger-devices-standby.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-958550" /><br/>
Both the Belkin and Anker models support Apple Watch fast charging, and I saw very similar charging speeds taking an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch-ultra/">Apple Watch Ultra 2</a> from 20% to 80% in under an hour, in line with what Apple's first-party fast charging cable delivers.<br/>
<br/>
One significant factor in favor of the <a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=J2shFQg6J/U&mid=43469&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.anker.com%2Fproducts%2Fa25m3-maggo-qi2-wireless-charging-station-magsafe-compatible">Anker MagGo Wireless Charging Station (3-in-1 Stand)</a> (<a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0CFXLVY1V%2F">also available at Amazon</a>) is pricing, with a regular price of &#36;99.99 compared to the <a href="https://belkin.evyy.net/9gRV05">Belkin BoostCharge Pro 3-in-1 Magnetic Wireless Charging Stand with Qi2 15W</a> (<a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0CYDDTB8W%2F">also available at Amazon</a>) at a regular price of &#36;149.99.<br/>
<br/>
Both brands do occasionally offer sales, with Belkin running a Summer Travel Sale on its own site at the time of this writing that can save you some money. With a regular price of &#36;149.99, the BoostCharge Pro qualifies for a &#36;25 discount on its own, but if you throw in a cheap cable or other accessory to bump above the &#36;150 level, you can save an additional &#36;20 on your total purchase.<br/>
<br/>
Both of these chargers are solid options for a desk or nightstand, as they allow you to charge multiple devices from Apple's ecosystem all in one spot with simple and convenient designs. I tend to prefer the overall design and functionality of the Belkin one, but the Anker one wins out on price, so it's definitely worth weighing those factors when making any purchasing decisions.<br/>

It's important to note that neither of these tree-style chargers folds up or disassembles, and as a result they both arrive in relatively large boxes, so these chargers are not very practical for travel. If it's important to be able to take your 3-in-1 charger with you, consider a more compact option such as the popular <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/review/anker-3-in-1-cube-magsafe/">Anker 3-in-1 Cube</a> or <a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=J2shFQg6J/U&mid=43469&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.anker.com%2Fproducts%2Fa2557-maggo-qi2-wireless-charging-station-magsafe-compatible">Anker Qi2 MagGo Foldable Charging Station</a>.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Samsung this week opened up a new sale on monitors and other devices, including one of the first discounts on the 32-inch Smart Monitor M80D, which just launched last month. You can get this brand new monitor for <a href="https://howl.me/cmEbIKKFC8A"><strong>&#36;549.99</strong></a>, down from &#36;699.99.<br/>
<br/>

When you click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment, which helps us keep the site running.</small></em><br/>
<br/>
The Smart Monitor M80D was announced at CES in January and launched in early June. It has much of the same hardware as last year's model and features 400 nits of brightness, a 60Hz refresh rate (non variable), 99% sRGB, and adaptive picture technology.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://howl.me/cmEbIKKFC8A"target="_blank"><div class="fancybutton"><div class="fancybadge">&#36;150 OFF</div>32-inch Smart Monitor M80D for &#36;549.99</div></a></div><br/>
<br/>
The display also retains key features like USB-C charging connectivity, AirPlay 2 support, an integrated webcam, and several smart TV features that enable it to be used when not connected to a PC.<br/>
<br/>
In terms of new features, the M80D includes a Multi Control feature that allows images and text to be moved between the display and a Galaxy Book, Tablet, or Phone. You can also pair Galaxy Buds to the monitor for a spatial audio experience with head tracking, as well as guided workouts when paired with a Galaxy Watch.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[<a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Famazonprime">Amazon Prime Day</a> is just a few days away, but you can already get all-time low prices on multiple Apple Watch models right now. As with all early deals, there is a chance that these Apple Watch discounts get even steeper when Prime Day officially kicks off on July 16, but for right now they're still great discounts on each model.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/prime-day-series-9.jpg" alt="" width="2002" height="1126" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-958519" /><em><small>Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with Amazon.

<br/>
If you want to take advantage of all Prime Day has to offer, remember that only Amazon Prime members will be able to gain access to the majority of deals during the event. If you aren't a member, <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Famazonprime%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26geniuslink%3Dtrue"><strong>you can join Prime</strong></a> via a free 30-day trial to participate in this year's Prime Day. Once your trial is over, Prime membership will run for &#36;14.99/month or &#36;139/year. For students, that's &#36;7.49/month or &#36;69/year.<br/>

		<title>Apple Vision Pro Unlikely to Hit 500,000 Sales This Year, Says IDC</title>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's Vision Pro spatial computing headset has yet to sell 100,000 units in the quarter since it launched in the U.S. in February, according to market tracker IDC (via <em><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-07-11/apple-s-vision-pro-won-t-cross-500-000-sales-this-year-idc-says">Bloomberg</a></em>).<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/Apple-Vision-Pro-at-Steve-Jobs-Theater.jpeg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-898794" /><br/>
The device is projected to see a 75% drop in domestic sales in the current quarter, but the launch of Vision Pro internationally this month is expected to offset that decline. <br/>
<br/>
IDC believes that a more affordable version at roughly half the price of the current &#36;3,500 unit should rekindle interest in 2025, but sales are not expected to rise significantly over the coming year. <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a> is set to launch in the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, France, and Germany on Friday, July 12.<br/>
<br/>
Reviews for the device have been mixed overall. For the most part, users have been impressed with the hardware and the technology introduced by the Vision Pro, but there are questions about the actual function of the device, the intuitiveness of the gesture-based control, the weight and comfort, and VR in general. Users have also been critical of the lack of content for the device. <br/>
<br/>
"The Vision Pro's success, regardless of its price, will ultimately depend on the available content," said Francisco Jeronimo, vice president at IDC. "As Apple expands the product to international markets, it's crucial that local content is also made available."<br/>
<br/>
Apple is expected to produce fewer than 400,000 Vision Pro headsets in 2024 due to the complexity of manufacturing, according to analyst <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/">Ming-Chi Kuo</a>. However, Apple is said to be already working on a new version of the ‌&zwnj;Apple Vision Pro&zwnj;‌ for 2025 that will be <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/19/gurman-apple-vision-pro-2-at-least-18-months-away/">priced more affordably</a>.
