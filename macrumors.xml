		<description><![CDATA[After over a year of reports, there are now <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone-15-vs-iphone-16/">20 specific rumors</a> about the features and improvements set to be offered by the two non-Pro <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a> models upon their announcement next week. <br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/iPhone-14-vs-16-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-941488" /></div><br/>
While the upgrades that the &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; offers over the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a> will likely be at the center of Apple's marketing strategy later this year, many users are on two-year upgrade cycles, so the features introduced on both the &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; will stack up. All of the changes the &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; models are expected to feature compared to their two direct forerunners are listed below, using information from a range of reliable sources that we have <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">previously covered</a>, here on <em>MacRumors</em>. We will continue to update this article as more rumors emerge prior to Apple's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/26/apple-september-9-iphone-event/">"It's Glowtime" event</a> on Monday, September 9.<br/>
<br/>
This guide focuses on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-14/">iPhone 14</a> and &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj;, but to learn about how we are expecting the &zwnj;iPhone 14&zwnj; Pro to improve on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/">iPhone 16 Pro</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone-14-pro-vs-iphone-16-pro/">see our other comparison article</a>. <br/>
<br/>
<h3 id="design">Design</h3><br/>
The &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; Plus are expected to largely carry over the design of their predecessors. As a result, the &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; will be a relatively significant evolution over the ‌&zwnj;iPhone 14&zwnj;‌, featuring slightly rounded edges, a frosted glass back, and a vertical rear camera arrangement to facilitate spatial video capture. Other important design changes are expected to include the removal of the mute switch in favor of the Action button introduced on last year's Pro models and the introduction of an all-new "Capture" button.<br/>

The &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; models could receive some major improvements in battery technology and charging, sporting denser batteries and faster charging capabilities. It is worth noting that the &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; Plus is rumored to feature a smaller battery than its predecessors, but it is not clear how this will affect actual battery life. <br/>

<h2 id="will_it_be_worth_upgrading">Will It Be Worth Upgrading?</h2><br/>
The ‌&zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; was a fairly significant upgrade over the ‌&zwnj;iPhone 14&zwnj;‌ in 2023, introducing a more modern design with the &zwnj;Dynamic Island&zwnj;, a USB-C port, and a 48-megapixel camera. The ‌&zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; will build on these upgrades, offering the Capture and Action buttons, Apple Intelligence, and spatial video capture. With over 30 upgrades rumored to be in store, many ‌current &zwnj;iPhone 14&zwnj;‌ users will find upgrading to an ‌&zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; model worthwhile, if not essential.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="release_date">Release Date</h2><br/>
The &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; Plus are expected to be announced at Apple's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/26/apple-september-9-iphone-event/">"It's Glowtime" event</a> on Monday, September 9. Pre-orders are likely to open on Friday, September 13, with launch following one week later on Friday, September 20.

		<description><![CDATA[The latest version of Bluetooth was <a href="https://www.bluetooth.com/blog/now-available-new-version-of-the-bluetooth-core-specification/">released this week</a>, and it includes a new feature that could benefit the Find My app across Apple devices.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/06/precision-finding-airtag-design-session.jpeg" alt="" width="1800" height="1012" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-803337" /><br/>
Bluetooth 6.0 introduces "<a href="https://www.bluetooth.com/learn-about-bluetooth/feature-enhancements/channel-sounding/">Channel Sounding</a>," a feature that will bring "true distance awareness" to billions of future Bluetooth devices and accessories. The organization behind Bluetooth promises that this technology will <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/bluetooth-sig-introduces-true-distance-awareness-new-secure-fine-ranging-feature-enhances-bluetooth-connected-devices-302235876.html"">achieve</a> "centimeter-level accuracy over considerable distances," making it easier and quicker for users to locate lost items.<br/>
<br/>
Apple already offers a Precision Finding feature in the Find My app that leverages Ultra Wideband technology to help users pinpoint the specific location of select accessories. The feature is available on the iPhone 11 and newer, and currently it can be used to find an AirTag or a second-generation AirPods Pro charging case.<br/>
<br/>
Apple could use both Bluetooth 6.0 and Ultra Wideband technologies in unison to improve Precision Finding. Bluetooth 6.0 also paves the way for Precision Finding-like location accuracy for devices that are not equipped with Ultra Wideband chips, such as the Apple TV's Siri Remote and devices released by other companies.<br/>
<br/>
It is unclear when the first devices with Bluetooth 6.0 will be released, but given that the specification is only just now available to hardware manufacturers and developers, the first Apple devices with support are likely at least a year away.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/bluetooth/">Bluetooth</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/04/bluetooth-6-0-now-available/">Bluetooth 6 Launches, Could Enhance iPhone&#039;s Precision Finding Feature</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/bluetooth-6-launches-could-enhance-iphones-precision-finding-feature.2435070/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple introduced the third-generation AirPods almost three years ago. An all new model is now slated to launch at Apple's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/26/apple-september-9-iphone-event/">"It's Glowtime" event</a> on September 9 with a range of improvements and new features.<br/>

Many of the changes and improvements introduced with the third-generation AirPods originated on the first-generation <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/">AirPods Pro</a>. As such, it seems likely that many of the upgrades coming to the fourth-generation AirPods will be shaped by the second-generation &zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj;. Our best indications so far about what to expect come from a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/17/airpods-4-new-design/">report by <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman</a> published last year.<br/>
<br/>
<h3 id="two_models">Two Models</h3><br/>
Apple is rumored to be working on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/17/airpods-4-new-design/">two versions</a> of the fourth-generation AirPods targeting different price points. The company is apparently aiming to replace both the third-generation AirPods and the lower-priced second-generation AirPods that it continues to sell. Currently, there is little difference between the AirPods 2 and ‌<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods/">AirPods 3</a>‌ beyond their designs.<br/>
<br/>
Two features that have been limited to the ‌‌&zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj;‌‌ so far will purportedly come to the higher-end version of the AirPods: Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) and a speaker in the charging case that can play a sound for easy location.<br/>
<br/>
<h3 id="design_changes">Design Changes</h3><br/>
The next-generation AirPods are rumored to feature an updated design, looking like a cross between the current AirPods and the &zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj;, with slightly shorter stems. Fit is expected to be improved, but it is still unclear if Apple will add silicone ear tips.<br/>
<br/>
<h3 id="h2_chip">H2 Chip</h3><br/>
One of the key aspects the next-generation AirPods are likely to bring over from the second-generation &zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj; is the H2 chip. Both the second- and third-generation AirPods feature the H1 chip.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2019/10/airpods-pro-h2-chip.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-866128" /><br/>
Apple says the H2 chip provides an "exceptional acoustic experience" when paired with a new low-distortion audio driver and custom amplifier in the &zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj;. The ‌&zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj;‌ offer richer bass and clearer sound across a wider range of frequencies partly due to the computational audio improvements facilitated by the H2 chip, so similar enhancements seem highly likely to come to the fourth-generation AirPods.<br/>
<br/>
There could also be improvements to Personalized Spatial Audio, faster pairing and device switching, and persistent battery information thanks to the H2 chip.<br/>
<br/>
<h3 id="bluetooth_5.3">Bluetooth 5.3</h3><br/>
In the &zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj;, the H2 chip is accompanied by Bluetooth 5.3 connectivity. Many of Apple's products now feature Bluetooth 5.3, so the fourth-generation AirPods are highly likely to receive this upgrade. Bluetooth 5.3 offers faster and more reliable connectivity with Bluetooth accessories, as well as improved power efficiency, which can contribute to longer battery life. <br/>
<br/>
<h3 id="longer_battery_life">Longer Battery Life</h3><br/>
The H2 chip is more power efficient than the H1 chip in the second- and third-generation AirPods. In the &zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj;, the H2 chip and Bluetooth 5.3 provide an additional hour and a half of listening time with Active Noise Cancellation enabled compared to the previous generation. Applied to the standard AirPods, this could translate to a battery life increase from five hours to around six and a half hours.<br/>
<br/>
<h3 id="improved_audio_quality">Improved Audio Quality</h3><br/>
The fourth-generation &zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj; are expected to offer <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/19/gurman-airpods-4-this-year/">improved audio quality</a> compared to their predecessors, perhaps enabled by the design tweaks or improved computational audio thanks to the H2 chip.<br/>
<br/>
<h3 id="volume_controls">Volume Controls</h3><br/>
It is also possible that the AirPods could gain touch-based volume controls like the &zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj;. To turn the volume up or down, users simply place their thumb on the stem of either AirPod and use their index finger to swipe up or down on the small touch control area.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/09/Apple-AirPods-Pro-2nd-gen-Touch-control-220907.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-866685" /><br/>
That being said, Apple could regard on-device volume controls as a high-end feature reserved for the &zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj; and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-max/">AirPods Max</a>, meaning that the fourth-generation AirPods could still miss out on this feature.<br/>
<br/>
<h3 id="find_my_improvements">Find My Improvements</h3><br/>
The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe-battery-pack/">MagSafe</a> Charging Case is also likely to get several improvements to integrate more deeply with <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/find-my-network-accessory-program/">Find My</a>. The second-generation &zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj; introduced two key features in this area: The U1 chip for Precision Tracking and a built-in speaker.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/09/airpods-pro-2-precision-finding.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-866313" /><br/>
Currently, your <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> or <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> can help guide you to their location in the &zwnj;Find My&zwnj; app, but this is a limited experience on the current model, simply indicating whether or not they are nearby. The U1 chip would allow your &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; to show an arrow pointing in the specific direction of your AirPods, an approximate distance telling you how far away they are, and even a message saying if they are located on a different floor.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/09/AirPods-Pro-2-Charging-Case.jpeg" alt="" width="1600" height="895" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-862696" /><br/>
Similarly, you can currently play a sound on your AirPods to help you find them, but this is played through the earbuds. If the earbuds are inside the charging case, it is likely the sound will be quite muffled. With the latest generation &zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj;, Apple added a speaker to the charging case itself, allowing users to more clearly hear a location alert from their AirPods, and even locate the case when it is separate from the earbuds. An identical speaker is expected to come to the high-end version of the standard AirPods in their next iteration.<br/>
<br/>
It is also worth noting that the lanyard loop on the &zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj; doubles as an antenna for the U1 chip, so this small feature could also be coming to the next-generation AirPods if they do offer Precision Tracking.<br/>
<br/>
<h3 id="apple_watch_charger_compatibility">Apple Watch Charger Compatibility</h3><br/>
The third-generation AirPods can charge via &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj;, a Qi wireless charger, or a Lightning cable. With its latest &zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj; model, Apple added the ability to use an Apple Watch charger as an additional charging method. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2019/10/airpods-pro-apple-watch-charger.jpg" alt="" width="1564" height="878" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-866129" /><br/>
Apple does not seem to regard charging technologies as "Pro"-exclusive features, so, as a basic utility, it seems likely that this added charging method will come to the fourth-generation AirPods to provide even more versatility. <br/>
<br/>
<h3 id="hearing_aid_functionality">Hearing Aid Functionality</h3><br/>
In a software update coming later next year, Apple will apparently add hearing aid functionality, allowing AirPods to serve as an over-the-counter (OTC) hearing alternative to traditional hearing aids. The FDA in 2022 approved <a href="https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/hearing-aids/otc-hearing-aids-what-you-should-know">OTC hearing aid options</a>, paving the way for Apple to market the AirPods for hearing loss. Apple also allegedly plans to offer hearing tests that would tell AirPods users if they are experiencing hearing loss.<br/>
<br/>
<h3 id="usb-c_port">USB-C Port</h3><br/>
Like the most recent &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; models and the USB-C &zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj;, the fourth-generation AirPods are expected to include a USB-C port for charging.<br/>
<br/>
<h3 id="release_date">Release Date</h3><br/>
The fourth-generation AirPods are widely expected to be announced at Apple's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/26/apple-september-9-iphone-event/">"It's Glowtime" event</a> on Monday, September 9 alongside the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a> lineup, the Apple Watch Series 10, the Apple Watch Ultra 3, and the third-generation <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch-se/">Apple Watch SE</a>. Third-generation &zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj; are also in the works, but they are not expected to launch <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/19/gurman-airpods-4-this-year/">until a later date</a>.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods/">AirPods 3</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AirPods">AirPods (Don't Buy)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/airpods.216">AirPods</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airpods-4/">AirPods 4 Rumors: Everything We Know So Far</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/airpods-4-rumors-everything-we-know-so-far.2397674/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Spotify is globally rolling out "Daylist," a personalized playlist that adapts and evolves to your listening habits as you go about your day.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/daylist-spotify.jpeg" alt="" width="4001" height="2251" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-963550" /><br/>
Available to both free and paying users, the playlist has actually been available in English-speaking markets since September of last year, and expanded to 65 more countries in March. Today, the company is adding support for 14 additional languages, making Daylist accessible to all markets in which Spotify is available.<br/>
<br/>
According to <em><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/04/spotify-launches-its-evolving-playlist-daylist-globally/">TechCrunch</a></em>, Daylist is now available in Arabic, Catalan, French (Canada), French (France), German, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Polish, Portuguese (Brazil), Spanish (Spain), Spanish (Mexico), and Turkish.<br/>
<br/>
To access the Daylist in Spotify, navigate to the "Made for You" section in the app, or <a href="https://spotify.com/daylist">use this link</a> if you're on the web. According to Spotify, the playlist uses data from "niche music and microgenres" that users listen to at certain times of the day to suggest tracks and update itself. Graphics for the Daylist also adapt throughout the day.<br/>
<br/>
Individual Daylist playlists can also be saved by tapping the three dot menu, selecting "Add to Playlist", and then tapping "New Playlist." Daylists also include a built-in sharing feature designed for social media that comes with a ready-made screenshot, personalized sticker, or customizable sharecard.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Instagram has <a href="https://x.com/instagram/status/1831013996948029765">announced</a> support for leaving comments on Stories, the ephemeral posts that have become almost as popular as regular Instagram posts.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/03/Instagram-Feature-2.jpg" alt="" width="2250" height="1266" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-786418" /><br/>
Previously, the only option was to send a private reply, which appeared as a direct message visible solely to the Story's creator. Now, Instagram has introduced a more public option: Comments. These comments are visible to other users, unlike the private replies. <br/>
<br/>
However, the ability to comment comes with restrictions. Only mutual followers (meaning people who follow the Story creator and are followed back by them) can leave comments. Instagram says the new feature aims to offer a more open way to engage with Stories, while still maintaining the original private messaging option for those who prefer one-on-one interactions.<br/>
<br/>
Like the Stories themselves, comments posted about them are temporary and last for up to 24 hours. Users have the option to turn comments on or off when sharing Stories, but Instagram has not said whether they are archived along with a Story when it reaches its end of life.<br/>
<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple is introducing a new camera-based "Capture" button on at least some iPhone 16 models this year, and a new rumor claims that Apple's own silicone cases will have a design that is specially made so as not to impede the use of the capacitive button's multiple functions.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/iPhone-16-Side-New-Action-Button-Emphasis-Bump.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-917543" /><br/>
Several rumors have suggested that the iPhone 16 models are going to have an all-new button that's designed to make it easier to capture photos when the devices are held in landscape mode. Apple plans to put the button on the right side of the ‌iPhone‌, in the space where the mmWave antenna is on iPhones that are sold in the United States. <br/>
<br/>
As a capacitive button geared towards fine-grained photography controls, it is said to have <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/13/iphone-16-capture-button-features/">support for multiple gestures</a> and the ability to respond to pressure. In a new post on X (Twitter), Chinese leaker DuanRui <a href="https://x.com/duanrui1205/status/1831245321222984112">shared an image</a> of unofficial third-party silicone cases with an opening in the expected location of the Capture button. <br/>
<br/>
In a machine-translated comment on the image, DuanRui noted that "the official protective case of Apple's iPhone 16 series will not have this opening and will be made into an integrated design, which will not affect the normal use of this capacitive button." <br/>
<br/>
The Capture Button has been depicted in CAD renders and dummy models of all four ‌iPhone‌ devices, but <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman last week <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-08-11/iphone-16-preview-bigger-screens-new-colors-camera-button-ai-and-a18-chip-lzpk5495">suggested</a> that there is a possibility that it will only be available on the Pro models.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="zh" dir="ltr">据说，苹果 iPhone 16 系列官方保护壳，没有这个开孔，会做成一体式设计，还不会影响这颗电容式按键正常使用。 <a href="https://t.co/uSkaQqwXFe">pic.twitter.com/uSkaQqwXFe</a></p>&mdash; DuanRui段锐 (@duanrui1205) <a href="https://twitter.com/duanrui1205/status/1831245321222984112?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 4, 2024</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div><br/>
Along with a Capture Button, the ‌iPhone 16‌ models will feature slightly bigger displays on the Pro devices, a new A18 chip that supports Apple Intelligence, and 8GB RAM for all models, which is necessary to power Apple's AI models.

		<description><![CDATA[As Apple's iPhone 16 launch approaches, questions are swirling about a potential leap in storage capacity for the iPhone 16 Pro models. According to a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/19/iphone-16-pro-2tb-option-rumor/">January report</a>, the iPhone 16 Pro and Pro Max will double their maximum storage to 2TB.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/iPhone-16-Pro-Right-Side-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-928697" /><br/>
This speculation stems from Apple's rumored adoption of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/17/1tb-iphone-16-pro-could-face-performance-setback/">Quad-Level Cell (QLC) NAND flash memory</a>. QLC technology could allow Apple to pack more storage into a smaller space while potentially reducing costs compared to the current Triple-Level Cell (TLC) NAND.<br/>
<br/>
However, it's crucial to approach these rumors with caution. Similar claims about 2TB options surfaced for both the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/01/iphone-14-to-feature-2tb-storage/">iPhone 14 Pro</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/07/iphone-15-pro-2tb-storage-option/">iPhone 15 Pro</a>, which ultimately proved false. Yet despite this history, there are new factors that lend credibility to the latest 2TB rumors.<br/>
<br/>
The iPhone 16 Pro models are reportedly set to receive significant camera upgrades that could justify the need for increased storage. Rumors suggest an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/15/iphone-16-pro-wifi-7-48mp-ultra-wide-rumors/">improved ultra-wide camera with a 48-megapixel sensor</a>, featuring the same pixel-binning technology as the main camera. This upgrade, combined with a wider f/2.2 aperture, promises substantially better low-light performance and support for 48-megapixel ProRaw photography. <br/>
<br/>
Apple is also said to be introducing a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/22/iphone-16-lineup-wave-of-camera-improvements/">new image format</a> called "JPEG-XL." This addition to the existing lineup of HEIF, JPEG, HEIF Max, ProRaw, and ProRAW Max formats could potentially result in larger file sizes, making increased storage more necessary. The rumored capability to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/22/iphone-16-lineup-wave-of-camera-improvements/">shoot 3K video at 120 frames per second with Dolby Vision</a> on the Pro models would also generate significantly larger files.<br/>
<br/>
Last but not least, Apple is reportedly planning to introduce a dedicated "<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/13/iphone-16-capture-button-features/">Capture Button</a>" for the iPhone 16 Pro models, emphasizing the device's role as a serious photography and video capture device. Taken together, this collective push towards professional-grade image and video capabilities could justify the need for increased storage options.<br/>
<br/>
While the prospect of a 2TB iPhone is exciting, especially for content creators and power users, it's important to bear in mind that QLC NAND does have drawbacks. Most notably, it typically offers slower read and write speeds compared to TLC NAND.<br/>
<ul><li><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/01/iphone-16-launch-month-is-here-everything-we-know/">iPhone 16 Launch Month Is Here: Everything We Know</a></li></ul><br/>
As we await official announcements from Apple during its upcoming <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/26/apple-september-9-iphone-event/">"It's Glowtime" event on September 9</a>, the possibility of a 2TB iPhone 16 Pro model remains an uncertain prospect. Whether this will be the year Apple finally breaks the storage barrier remains to be seen, but the combination of new hardware features and evolving storage technology certainly makes it a possibility. And if it doesn't happen, there's always hope for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/28/10-reasons-to-wait-iphone-17/">next year</a>.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/">iPhone 16 Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/04/will-iphone-16-pro-max-get-a-2tb-storage-option/">New iPhone 16 Pro 2TB Storage Option: All the Rumors In Favor</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/new-iphone-16-pro-2tb-storage-option-all-the-rumors-in-favor.2435045/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Bitmo Lab today <a href="https://www.bitmolab.com/pages/gamebaby">introduced the GameBaby</a>, a case that's perfect for playing retro games on an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>. The GameBaby is a clever two-part accessory that adds a d-pad and buttons to the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; for gaming, and works as a protective case for day-to-day use.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/gamebaby-1.jpg" alt="" width="1776" height="1000" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-963507" /><br/>
The lower part of the case can be detached from the upper part and placed on the front of the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;, providing a physical interface that's ideal for retro games that have recently been made available on iOS <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/17/delta-game-emulator-iphone/">through emulators like Delta</a>. When you're not gaming, it pops off and can be attached to the back of the phone, for protection with added gaming functionality.<br/>
<br/>
The case does not have power and does not connect to the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; in any way, which suggests they are capacitive and designed to activate on-screen buttons. According to Bitmo Lab, the case is compatible with Game Boy, Game Boy Color, Game Boy Advanced and NES button layouts, with custom emulator skins that offer "perfect compatibility" across different handheld console layouts.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/gamebaby-2.jpg" alt="" width="1999" height="1264" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-963508" /><br/>
The GameBaby has specifically been designed to work with the layouts made available through the Delta emulator. It will be available for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a> Max and the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/">iPhone 16 Pro</a> Max.<br/>
<br/>
The GameBaby <a href="https://www.bitmolab.com/products/gamebaby">can be pre-ordered for &#36;20</a> for the first 1,000 units, with the pre-order price going up to &#36;25 after that.

		<description><![CDATA[Intel <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/newsroom/news/core-ultra-200v-series-mobile.html">today unveiled</a> its new "Lunar Lake" Intel Core Ultra 200V processors, designed for thin and light AI PCs. Intel's new chips are meant to compete with Apple silicon chips and the Qualcomm Snapdragon X Elite chips that Microsoft recently adopted for its AI-focused Copilot+ PCs.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe title="Intel Core Ultra Launch Event (Replay)" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LVI7DTjp6NQ" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div><br/>
According to Intel, the Lunar Lake chips are its most efficient x86 processors ever, built "without compromise." Intel claims that the p-core in the Lunar Lake chip is the "fastest CPU core of any processor in a thin and light laptop," and that its Xe2 graphics architecture is the "fastest built-in GPU in the industry."<br/>
<br/>
Intel says that it tested almost 50 games and the Lunar Lake chips were 16 percent faster than AMD chips and 68 percent faster than Qualcomm chips. The chip has four p-cores (power) and four e-cores (efficiency), similar to the Apple silicon chips, and memory is no longer separate.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/intel-core-ultra.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-963515" /><br/>
Intel didn't compare its new chips to Apple silicon chips, but the Qualcomm Snapdragon X Elite's CPU performance is not too far off from the M4 chip, so the Lunar Lake chips could be faster. Memory maxes out at 32GB though, so Intel doesn't have chips able to compete with the Pro and Max Apple silicon chips.<br/>
<br/>
Intel says that compared to Qualcomm's chips, Lunar Lake offers a 20 percent improvement in performance per watt, with the chip drawing up to 40 percent less power than its predecessor. Intel says that consumers can expect several more hours of battery life, along with significant gains in performance, graphics, and AI.<br/>
<br/>
Devices with Intel's latest chips are set to be available starting on September 24.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/intel/">Intel</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/03/intel-lunar-lake-chip-improvements/">Intel Says New Lunar Lake Chips Have &#039;Fastest Built-In GPU in the Industry&#039;</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/intel-says-new-lunar-lake-chips-have-fastest-built-in-gpu-in-the-industry.2435029/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Microsoft's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/20/microsoft-ai-windows-pcs/">new Copilot+ PCs</a> that offer super fast performance for AI tasks, all-day battery life, and other perks, struggle when it comes to gaming, according to a report from <em><a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/microsoft-rolled-out-ai-pcs-that-cant-play-top-gamesand-theres-no-quick-fix-0a1b6376">The Wall Street Journal</a></em>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/microsoft-copilot-plus-pc.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1081" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-953308" /><br/>
The Copilot+ PCs are equipped with Arm-based Qualcomm Snapdragon chips that merge the CPU, GPU, and a Neural Processing Unit. Using an Arm chip means Microsoft's PCs now face the some of the same problems as Apple's Macs, such as an inability to run popular PC games designed for x86 chip architecture. Approximately 15 percent of PC laptop users are gamers, and Microsoft users aren't accustomed to having to deal with incompatibilities. <br/>
<br/>
To get around the Arm issue, Microsoft designed Prism, which is basically the equivalent of Rosetta 2 on Apple Macs. It makes it so x86 apps can run on Arm-based Windows machines, but it turns out it's not working well. In a test of 1,300 PC games, only half of them ran without bugs, glitches, or launch issues.<br/>
<br/>
In some cases, anti-cheating software in games like Fortnite and League of Legends can't be translated to run on Arm, preventing even games without significant graphics requirements from running. There is no quick fix for the problem.<br/>
<br/>
Reviews of the Copilot+ PCs highlighted problems with Prism way back in June. <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/26/24186432/microsoft-windows-on-arm-qualcomm-copilot-plus-pcs-prism-emulator">The Verge</a></em>, for example, said that Premiere Pro was "practically unusable" and that rendering projects in Blender was "terrible." Shadows of the Tomb Raider crashed continually, and other titles like Destiny 2, Starfield, Halo Infinite, and Fall Guys would not launch.<br/>
<br/>
Microsoft told <em>The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/wsj-com/">Wall Street Journal</a></em> that titles with demanding graphics requirements may not play on Copilot+ PCs, and that while it is aiming to make a "quality gaming experience" on the new devices, players who want a high-performance experience should choose an alternate PC.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/microsoft/">Microsoft</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/03/microsoft-ai-pcs-game-issues/">Microsoft&#039;s New AI Computers Struggle With Hundreds of Popular PC Games</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/microsofts-new-ai-computers-struggle-with-hundreds-of-popular-pc-games.2435023/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Accessory maker Zens this week introduced the <a href="https://zens.tech/shop/quattro-charger-pro-4/">Quattro Charger Pro 4</a>, a multi-device charging station with a unique design. There are two rectangular charging platforms, each with a pair of magnetic charging surfaces for charging four total devices at one time.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/zens-quattro-charger.jpg" alt="" width="1511" height="850" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-963504" /><br/>
The Quattro is a Qi2 charger, so each of the magnetic charging pucks can charge an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> at up to 15W. With Qi2 support and the multi-level design, the Quattro is able to charge four iPhones at once at 15W.<br/>
<br/>
Because the charger is flat, it works with both MagSafe-compatible iPhones and older Qi devices that do not have included magnets. The charging surface can also be used for AirPods and other smartphones, but it does not work with the Apple Watch. Given the orientation of the charger, it is worth noting that StandBy is not supported.<br/>
<br/>
The Quattro Charger Pro 4 can be <a href="https://zens.tech/shop/quattro-charger-pro-4/">pre-ordered from the Zens website</a> for &#36;200, with black and white color options available.

		<description><![CDATA[Apple has allowed cloud gaming apps on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a> <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/25/apple-allows-game-streaming-apps-on-app-store/">since earlier this year</a>, but cloud gaming services still haven't bothered making iOS apps. Microsoft recently explained why, telling UK regulators that it didn't bring Xbox Cloud Gaming to Apple's &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; because the rules are still too restrictive.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/09/App-Store-and-XCloud.jpg" alt="" width="2250" height="1266" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-758525" /><br/>
The UK's Competition and Markets Authority <a href="https://www.gov.uk/cma-cases/mobile-browsers-and-cloud-gaming">is investigating</a> mobile browsers and cloud gaming, and put out a call for comments. Microsoft responded in late July (via <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/3/24234777/microsoft-apple-cloud-gaming-app-store-changes-xbox-cma">The Verge</a></em>) and said [<a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/66d6d0d19084b18b95709f13/Microsoft_WP_6_Redacted_version_-_TO_BE_PUBLISHED__1_.pdf">PDF</a>] that while cloud gaming apps are technically allowed, there are still multiple rules that cloud gaming apps can't comply with for "technical and economic reasons."<br/>
<br/>
Microsoft's chief complaint is that the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; rules require subscriptions and features to be made available on iOS devices with in-app purchase, which is "not feasible." A consumption-only situation where content is purchased on another platform and played on iOS is not allowed for cloud gaming apps.<br/>
<br/>
Apple's 30 percent commission fee "makes it impossible" for Microsoft to monetize its cloud gaming service, and it is neither "economically sustainable nor justifiable."<br/>
<br/>
Microsoft also complains about Apple's lack of support for alternative app stores and the limitations of web apps, such as an inability to access device hardware features.<br/>
<br/>
Google also submitted a separate document in the UK, and it simply suggests that regulators focus on the iOS &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; rather than taking a look at Google Play.<br/>
<br/>
Apple's <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/66d6c53fc52d5fb4c82ddd66/2024-08-07_Apple_Response_to_Working_Paper_6_-_TO_BE_PUBLISHED.pdf">own statement</a> said that it "supports and encourages" cloud gaming services on iOS, and that there are successful cloud gaming services <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/antstream-arcade/id1311611749">such as Antstream</a>. Apple suggested that regulators revisit their thinking following its support for cloud gaming, which did happen after the investigation launched.<br/>
<br/>
The UK will take Microsoft's comments and comments from other parties into account when making a decision in the ongoing mobile browser and cloud gaming investigation.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/microsoft/">Microsoft</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/united-kingdom/">United Kingdom</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/xbox/">Xbox</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/03/microsoft-cloud-gaming-ios-app-impossible/">Microsoft Says Apple&#039;s 30% Fee Makes Xbox Cloud Gaming iOS App &#039;Impossible&#039;</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/microsoft-says-apples-30-fee-makes-xbox-cloud-gaming-ios-app-impossible.2435013/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Logitech subsidiary <a href="https://ultimate-ears.dubn.net/33geA">Ultimate Ears</a> has been in the portable wireless speaker market for over a decade now, gradually building a full set of models across a range of sizes, power, and price points. The most recent addition to the lineup is the <a href="https://ultimate-ears.dubn.net/B0jQZJ">EVERBOOM</a>, a mid-range speaker that debuted a few months ago. I've been testing one out and I've found it to be a handy and capable speaker in a variety of settings.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/ue-everboom-parts.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-963488" /><br/>
Priced at &#36;249.99, the EVERBOOM sits in the middle of the Ultimate Ears lineup, which currently ranges from the WONDERBOOM 4 at &#36;99.99 all the way up to the HYPERBOOM at &#36;399.99. Like many of Ultimate Ears' speakers, the EVERBOOM is designed for an active lifestyle, offering IP67 water and dust resistance to stand up to not just splashes but full dunks in water. The speaker even floats, and it's been drop tested from a height of one meter.<br/>
<br/>
The EVERBOOM is more or less an elliptic cylinder, measuring a little over 8 inches (200 mm) high, 4.3 inches (110 mm) wide, and 3.25 inches (85 mm) deep. Aside from plastic toward the top and bottom of the speaker, it is wrapped entirely in a speaker mesh, with Ultimate Ears touting 360-degree sound. In reality, the audio largely comes from the two sides of the speaker, but with them firing in opposite directions, you do indeed get pretty solid sound projection all around. The EVERBOOM includes a pair of full-range transducers paired with two customized passive radiators to help deliver full sound from the relatively small form factor.<br/>
<br/>
I found sound quality to be quite good, with the 360-degree sound easily filling even a fairly large room and remaining quite audible and well-balanced outdoors. It can get quite loud if you turn it up, although distortion becomes a bit of an issue as you start to max it out in more enclosed environments.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/ue-everboom-front.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-963489" /><br/>
Volume is easily controlled right from the speaker with the huge iconic plus and minus buttons on the front. They're a bold design decision, but they make an Ultimate Ears speaker pretty much instantly recognizable. Pressing both of them simultaneously while the speaker is powered on gives you a general sense of battery level with some lights hidden behind the mesh up at the top.<br/>
<br/>
An Outdoor Boost mode can be activated with a button on the speaker or from within the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ue-boom/id632344648">UE | BOOM app</a>, offering a bit more punch with the sound output optimized for outdoor spaces. The increase in bass is definitely noticeable when it's turned on.<br/>
<br/>
Speaking of the UE | BOOM app, it offers an array of functionality for managing one or more speakers from the Utimate Ears lineup. You can of course use the EVERBOOM as a standalone Bluetooth speaker right from the options on your <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> or other device, but the app includes features like an equalizer, the ability to link multiple speakers, and more. With PARTYUP mode, you can sync up to 150 speakers from the UE lineup to maximize your sound. The app also offers convenient controls for changing tracks and volumes, turning the speaker on and off, activating Outdoor Boost, and activating a Microphone mode that lets you broadcast your voice over the speaker via your phone.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/ue-everboom-app-1.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="1031" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-963490" /><br/>
The equalizer panel offers five preset configurations: a flat Signature curve, a Bass Boost setting that does just what you'd expect, a Cramped Spaces option that drops the mids a bit, a Deep Relaxation mode that drops the treble way down, and a Podcast/Vocal setting that drops the bass. Any of these presets can be customized via five sliders spanning the various frequencies.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/ue-everboom-app-2.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="1031" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-963491" /><br/>
Another handy aspect of the UE | BOOM app is management of the Magic Button, which is a function of the play/pause hardware button on the speaker itself. The play/pause button offers the usual functionality with a single press playing or pausing music, a double press skipping forward, and a triple press skipping backward. But there's also a fourth function, and that's a long press to activate the Magic Button.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/ue-everboom-app-3.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="1031" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-963492" /><br/>
In the app, you can configure the Magic Button to activate a playlist from either <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/">Apple Music</a> or Amazon Music. It requires connecting the UE | BOOM app to those services, at which point you'll be able to see all of your saved playlists and select up to four of them to link to the Magic Button. A long press on the button on the speaker immediately starts the first playlist you've configured, and subsequent long presses will cycle through your selected playlists.<br/>
<br/>
Overall, the app only gets middling reviews from users, with some citing Bluetooth connection problems and ads covering important controls, but I haven't experienced any of those issues in my testing, so hopefully they've been resolved.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/ue-everboom-top.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="948" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-963493" /><br/>
Beneath the buttons on the top of the EVERBOOM is an NFC chip that allows for quick pairing and switching with Android devices. It doesn't currently work with iOS devices, but perhaps it will at some point in the future as Apple gradually opens up the NFC capabilities of its devices.<br/>
<br/>

The EVERBOOM offers up to 20 hours of battery life and a Bluetooth range of up to 55 meters (180 feet), offering solid flexibility while on the go. A small loop on the back of the speaker and an included carabiner make it easy to hang the EVERBOOM from a backpack, tent, or other convenient spot.

		<description><![CDATA[There are a number of ways that Apple, Google, Amazon, Meta, ByteDance, and Microsoft are failing to comply with the Digital Markets Act, according to <a href="https://www.beuc.eu/sites/default/files/publications/BEUC-X-2024-062_Summary-non-compliance-reports-gatekeepers.pdf">an analysis published</a> by the European Consumer Organization (BEUC). The BEUC advocates for consumer rights and provides guidance to European lawmakers.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/App-Store-vs-EU-Feature-2.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-932826" /><br/>
In regard to Apple, the BEUC outlines several ways that the company's DMA compliance efforts fall short, but it is worth noting that Apple has addressed many of these issues in its <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/08/app-store-external-links-european-union/">most recent DMA updates</a>, which will be implemented starting later in 2024. <br/>
<ul><br/>
 	<li>Apple creates unnecessary steps to impede or deter users from switching to alternative app stores or downloading apps outside of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a>.</li><br/>
 	<li>Apple does not make it easy for consumers to change their default settings.</li><br/>
 	<li>Apple's browser choice screen does not provide enough information for consumers to make an effective choice, and the choice screen is "confusing, complex and creates negative friction."</li><br/>
 	<li>Apple uses non-neutral language to scare consumers away from choosing alternative payment services or subscribing to cheaper services outside of an app. This is in reference to the disclosure screens that Apple presents when consumers use alternative payments.</li><br/>
 	<li>Apple does not allow end users to easily uninstall first-party apps, and while Safari can be deleted by the end of 2024, Apple was required to allow that feature by March.</li><br/>
 	<li>Apple does not provide adequate compliance reports to the European Commission, and has delayed the implementation of some of its DMA measures, a "blatant violation" of the DMA.</li><br/>
</ul><br/>
Many of the DMA changes that Apple announced last month make the report outdated, and the BEUC does acknowledge that Apple plans to implement tweaks to its DMA compliance. The BEUC says that the "precise details" of Apple's changes "will need to be evaluated." The report is clearly of the opinion, however, that Apple is taking too long to implement these features. Most of the updates will be made before the end of the year, while some others won't be enabled until spring 2025. Here's what Apple changed to better comply with the DMA:<br/>
<ul><br/>
 	<li>New default apps will be able to be set for phone calls, messaging, password managers, keyboards, navigation, translation, and call spam filters.</li><br/>
 	<li>There is a new Default Apps section in the Settings app, which specifically addresses one of the complaints in the BEUC's report. It was confusing to consumers to have to go to the "Safari" settings to manage a non-Safari default browser.</li><br/>
 	<li>Safari, &zwnj;App Store&zwnj;, Messages, Camera, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/photos/">Photos</a> apps will be able to be deleted.</li><br/>
 	<li>The browser selection screen shown to consumers at setup will include a description about the browser, an option to set a default right from the screen, and a requirement to scroll all the way down before choosing a browser.</li><br/>
 	<li>When a default browser that is not Safari is selected, that browser's icon will replace Safari's icon on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/home-screen/">Home Screen</a> or Dock.</li><br/>
</ul><br/>
For other tech companies, the BEUC targeted Meta's cross-service ads and messaging interoperability, Google's self-preferencing in search results and personal data use across services, Amazon's self-preferencing and difficulty unsubscribing from services, TikTok's personal data consent implementation, and Microsoft's customer consent screen for the use of data across services.<br/>
<br/>
The European Commission will likely take the recommendations from the BEUC into account when taking further action on the way tech companies are complying with the Digital Markets Act. The report says that it is not an exhaustive assessment of compliance with every provision of the DMA, and is instead focused on issues relevant to consumers. Apple's fees for developers, for example, would not fall under the scope of the report, so the company could also face changes to its DMA compliance in areas not mentioned here.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/03/eu-apple-dma-non-compliance-report/">EU Consumer Group Summarizes How Apple Fails to Comply With DMA</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/eu-consumer-group-summarizes-how-apple-fails-to-comply-with-dma.2435003/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today released the ninth beta of an upcoming <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/visionos-2/">visionOS 2</a> update to developers, with the beta coming a week <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/28/apple-seeds-visionos-2-beta-8/">after the eighth beta</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/visionOS-2-Feature-1.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-955607" /><br/>
Registered developers are able to opt into the betas by opening up the Settings app on their device, going to the Software Update Section, tapping on the "Beta Updates" option, and toggling on the Developer Beta. Note that an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-id/">Apple ID</a> associated with a developer account is required to download and install the beta.<br/>
<br/>
&zwnj;visionOS 2&zwnj; is able to take the depth information from 2D photos and turn them into 3D photos using advanced machine learning. Apple says that the feature is meant to add depth to photos to make memories more immersive.<br/>
<br/>
There are new hand gestures for activating the Home View and Control Center, and the Home View is also now customizable with apps able to be rearranged. Travel Mode now includes support for trains, and Guest User profiles are now saved for 30 days so guests don't have to do the setup process every time they try out the headset.<br/>
<br/>
Later in the year, Mac Virtual Display will support higher resolution and larger sized virtual displays, which Apple says will be equivalent to two 4K monitors side by side. With an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airplay/">AirPlay</a> update, the Vision Pro can serve as an &zwnj;AirPlay&zwnj; receiver, so content from the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>, or Mac can be shared to the headset.<br/>
<br/>
The Mindfulness app can track and respond to breathing patterns using the camera for an improved meditation experience, and the Vision Pro supports Bluetooth mice with &zwnj;visionOS 2&zwnj;.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/visionos/">visionOS</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/visionos-2/">visionOS 2</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-vision-pro.209">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/03/apple-seeds-visionos-2-beta-9/">Apple Seeds Ninth visionOS 2 Beta to Developers</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-seeds-ninth-visionos-2-beta-to-developers.2435001/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Huawei has announced a September 10 event where the Chinese company plans to unveil the world's first tri-folding smartphone, with the timing of the event an apparently deliberate attempt to upstage Apple's upcoming iPhone 16 reveal.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/huawei-trifold-event.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-963407" /><div class="center-wrap"><em>Huawei teaser showing tri-fold shape</em></div><br/>
Huawei hasn't yet officially shown off the pocketable phone, which reportedly has a 10-inch display when completely unfolded, but the company has shared a teaser on Weibo that depicts a device with three folding sides in a sort of reverse Z-shape, leaving little to the imagination about what's headlining the event. <br/>
<br/>
Concepts of a three-fold device have not been in short supply over the years, but Huawei clearly thinks it can bring one to market, although DSCC analyst Ross Young has <a href="https://x.com/DSCCRoss/status/1830469588108386780">suggested</a> that it will be the most expensive smartphone yet. The company's consumer and automotive technology executive Richard Yu called it an "epoch-making product."<br/>
<br/>
The Huawei event is scheduled for September 10 at 2:30 p.m. China Standard Time. That translates to 11.30 p.m. Pacific Time on September 9, so the same day of Apple's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/26/apple-september-9-iphone-event/">"It's Glowtime" event</a> for observers on the US West Coast. Apart from the foldable, new smartwatches and an electric car are also expected to be announced by Huawei on stage.<br/>
<br/>
Huawei's recent resurgence has significantly challenged Apple's position in the Chinese smartphone market. According to research firm <a href="https://www.canalys.com/newsroom/china-smartphone-market-Q2-2024">Canalys</a>, Apple's standing in China has notably declined, with the company falling out of the top five smartphone vendors by market share in the second quarter of 2023. <br/>
<br/>
In stark contrast, Huawei has experienced a remarkable upswing during the same period. The company saw its smartphone shipments in China surge by 41% compared to the same quarter last year, marking the fastest growth rate among the top five brands in the country. <br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple is expected to launch a fourth-generation iPhone SE early next year with an OLED display for the first time, marking the completion of Apple's adoption of OLED technology across all iPhone models.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/iPhone-SE-4-Thumb-1.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-951978" /><br/>
According to <em><a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Spotlight/Supply-Chain/Japan-no-longer-iPhone-display-supplier-as-Apple-ends-LCD-use">Nikkei Asia</a></em>, the move away from LCD displays will exclude two longstanding Japanese panel makers, Japan Display (JDI) and Sharp, from Apple's iPhone supply chain. <br/>
<br/>
In 2017, Apple introduced OLED screens with the iPhone X. Since then, OLED displays have replaced LCD screens in Apple's high-end iPhone models. This shift has significantly impacted LCD suppliers. In 2015, JDI and Sharp provided about 200 million LCD panels yearly for iPhones. <br/>
<br/>
However, by 2023, this number had decreased dramatically to around 20 million. Recently, Apple's gradual adoption of OLED has seen both Japanese LCD makers supply for just iPhone SE models.<br/>
<br/>
JDI currently only supplies small OLED displays for devices such as the Apple Watch. JDI is now focusing on revamping its business strategy around LCDs for automotive applications, while Sharp is scaling back its LCD business, which was primarily for TVs.<br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile, Apple has reportedly begun placing orders for OLED displays for the upcoming iPhone SE from China's BOE Technology Group and South Korea's LG Display.<br/>
<br/>
The fourth-generation ‌iPhone SE‌ is rumored to feature an iPhone 14-like design, Face ID instead of Touch ID, a USB-C port, an Action button, an Apple-designed 5G modem, an A18 processor, and an all-screen look that does away with the Home Button. The device's display is expected to grow in size from 4.7 inches to 6.06 inches, and internal RAM is likely to be 8GB, up from 4GB in the 2022 model, due to the hardware requirements of Apple Intelligence.<br/>
<br/>
Apple suppliers are expected to begin ramping up mass production of the device in October of this year. The device could be released ahead of the Lunar New Year in January 2025. However, all three existing iPhone SE models were announced in March over the years, so a March 2025 release seems possible too.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-se/">iPhone SE</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/nikkei-com/">Nikkei</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone_SE">iPhone SE (Don't Buy)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99">iPhone</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/03/iphone-se-4-complete-apple-switch-oled/">iPhone SE 4 to Complete Apple&#039;s Switch to OLED Across iPhone Lineup</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-se-4-to-complete-apples-switch-to-oled-across-iphone-lineup.2434977/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

<div class="center-wrap"><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/iPhone-14-Pro-vs-16-Pro-Feature-2.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-937778" /></div><br/>
In 2022, Apple unveiled the &zwnj;iPhone 14&zwnj; Pro as the successor to the popular <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-13/">iPhone 13</a> Pro, introducing an always-on display, the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/dynamic-island/">Dynamic Island</a>, a 48-megapixel camera, the A16 Bionic chip, longer battery life, and more. Two years later, the &zwnj;iPhone 16 Pro&zwnj; is expected to offer at least 60 upgrades. All of the changes the &zwnj;iPhone 16 Pro&zwnj; models are rumored to feature compared to their 2022 predecessor are listed below, using information from reliable sources that we have <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/">previously covered</a> here on <em>MacRumors</em>. We will continue to update this article as more rumors emerge prior to Apple's "It's glowtime" event on Monday, September 9.<br/>
