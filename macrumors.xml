		<description><![CDATA[A reference to an unreleased "Apple Pencil Pro" has been <a href="https://twitter.com/ribu_ap712/status/1787461116211479032">spotted in the source code</a> for Apple's homepage in Japan. We have independently confirmed that the code exists, but it would be unsurprising if Apple removes it after it was discovered.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/Apple-Pencil-on-iPad-Close.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-939788" /><br/>
This finding suggests that an Apple Pencil Pro could be announced <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/watch-let-loose-apple-event-may-7/">at the Apple Event tomorrow</a>. However, given the code does not appear on Apple's homepage in the U.S. or other countries, there is a chance that the Japanese website made a translation error.<br/>
<br/>
A computer translation of the source code:<blockquote>Folded green, yellow, orange and blue paper forms the Apple logo. Inside the logo, you can see the creator's hand holding the Apple Pencil Pro and drawing.</blockquote>Regardless of whether the Apple Pencil Pro name is used, a new Apple Pencil is expected to be announced at the Apple Event. Rumored features include a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/03/ios-17-5-apple-pencil-4-rumor/">new "squeeze" gesture</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/28/ipad-pro-m4-chip-and-apple-pencil-haptic-rumors/">haptic feedback</a>, while <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/25/apple-pencil-visionon-support-in-testing/">Vision Pro support is also a possibility</a> by visionOS 2.<br/>
<br/>
It is likely that the Apple Pencil Pro would replace the second-generation Apple Pencil, released in 2018. Other models available include the Apple Pencil with USB-C, and the original Apple Pencil from 2015, which is expected to be discontinued once Apple stops selling the ninth-generation iPad with a Lightning connector.<br/>
<br/>
Other products expected to be announced at the Apple Event include <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/28/ipad-pro-m4-chip-and-apple-pencil-haptic-rumors/">two new iPad Pro models with Apple's next-generation M4 chip</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/12/larger-ipad-air-launching-early-2024/">a larger 12.9-inch iPad Air</a> to go along with an updated 10.9-inch model, and a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/03/gurman-new-ipad-magic-keyboard-to-feature-aluminum/">redesigned Magic Keyboard for iPads</a>.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-pencil/">Apple Pencil</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipad-accessories.139">iPad Accessories</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/06/apple-pencil-pro/">&#039;Apple Pencil Pro&#039; Referenced in Code on Apple&#039;s Website in Japan</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-pencil-pro-referenced-in-code-on-apples-website-in-japan.2425538/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today updated Apple.com with a teaser for tomorrow's event, adding an interactive erasing feature that seems to hint at a refreshed version of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-pencil/">Apple Pencil</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/apple-event-erase-graphic.jpg" alt="" width="2112" height="1188" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-949256" /><br/>
Hovering over the Apple logo and moving the mouse allows the current artwork to be erased and replaced with a new logo design. Apple created a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/23/apple-event-has-six-artistic-logos/">total of six logos</a> for the May 7 "Let Loose" event, and the interactive eraser cycles through those options.<br/>
<br/>
The event is expected to focus on new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/">iPad Air</a> models, but rumors suggest the iPads will also be accompanied by an overhauled &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; and a refreshed version of the Magic Keyboard.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/03/ios-17-5-apple-pencil-4-rumor/">Code in iOS 17.5</a> mentions an &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; with a "squeeze" gesture, so it is possible that the new model that's coming will have a hardware-based erase option enabled with a squeeze. The current &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; models do not have a universal erase feature that works across apps, and adding such an option would likely be popular with users.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/may-2024-apple-event/">May 2024 Apple Event</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/06/apple-homepage-erasable-logo/">Erasable Logo on Apple&#039;s Homepage Hints at New Apple Pencil Coming Tomorrow</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/erasable-logo-on-apples-homepage-hints-at-new-apple-pencil-coming-tomorrow.2425535/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today announced that iOS 17.5 will be released to the public "soon," following over a month of beta testing. While the software update is relatively minor, it does have a few new features and changes, as outlined in the list below.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/iOS-17-All-New-Features-Thumb.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-912155" /><br/>
"The new Pride Radiance watch face and iPhone and iPad wallpapers will be available soon with watchOS 10.5, iOS 17.5, and iPadOS 17.5," said Apple, in its press release introducing a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/06/apple-unveils-2024-pride-edition-band/">new Pride Edition band for the Apple Watch</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Below, we have recapped everything new in the iOS 17.5 and iPadOS 17.5 betas so far.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Web Distribution</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/apple-ios-app-store-safari-changes.jpeg" alt="" width="2048" height="1151" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-933983" /><br/>
Starting <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/16/ios-17-5-app-web-downloads-eu/">with the second beta of iOS 17.5</a>, eligible developers are able to distribute their iOS apps to iPhone users located in the EU directly on the web, instead of through the App Store or an alternative app marketplace.<br/>
<br/>
"Web Distribution" is limited to larger developers based in the EU. To qualify for this distribution method, Apple says the developer must be a member of the Apple Developer Program for two continuous years or more, and have an app that had more than one million annual installs on iOS in the EU in the prior calendar year.<br/>
<br/>
"Web Distribution" builds upon the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/25/ios-17-4-alternative-app-marketplaces-eu/">alternative app marketplaces</a> that Apple already allows on the iPhone in the EU starting with iOS 17.4. Apple has made these app-related changes to comply with the EU's Digital Markets Act.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Quartiles</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/04/iOS-17.5-Quartiles-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-945719" /><br/>
iOS 17.5 includes a fun addition for Apple News+ subscribers: a daily word game called Quartiles.<br/>
<br/>
Quartiles tasks you with combining tiles to form words and earn points. Each puzzle starts with a grid of 20 tiles, and words can be formed with one to four tiles. A quartile is a four-tile word, and if you find all five in each puzzle, you earn a 40-point bonus. The website <em>Gadget Hacks</em> shared a <a href="https://ios.gadgethacks.com/how-to/apple-has-killer-new-word-game-puzzle-called-quartiles-hiding-ios-17-5-0385513/">walkthrough of the game</a> with more details.<br/>
<br/>
Quartiles is the third puzzle game included with an Apple News+ subscription, alongside Crossword and Crossword Mini. Starting with the iOS 17.5 beta, all three games integrate with Game Center to display leaderboards.<br/>
<br/>
On an iPhone updated to the iOS 17.5 beta, Quartiles can be found in the Apple News app under the Following tab → Puzzles. The game is also available on the iPad and Mac starting with the iPadOS 17.5 and macOS 14.5 betas.<br/>
<br/>
Apple News+ is available in the U.S., Australia, Canada, and the U.K., but the puzzle games seem to be limited to the U.S. and Canada for now.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Repair Mode</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/04/ios-17-5-repair-state.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-948810" /><br/>
iOS 17.5 <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/30/ios-17-5-repair-state/">introduces a "Repair State" option</a> that lets an ‌iPhone‌ be sent in for service without deactivating Find My and Activation Lock.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Color-Changing Apple Podcasts Widget</h2><br/>
While listening to a podcast on the iOS 17.5 beta, the background color of the Apple Podcasts widget changes to match the podcast's cover art. This feature was first added in the iOS 17.4 beta, but it was removed before that update was released.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Color-changing Apple Podcasts widget is back in iOS 17.5! <a href="https://t.co/2PonD5FMi6">pic.twitter.com/2PonD5FMi6</a></p>&mdash; Stephen Robles (@stephenrobles) <a href="https://twitter.com/stephenrobles/status/1775223262751977723?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 2, 2024</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div><br/>
<h2>Mobile Device Management</h2><br/>
<br/>
As noted <a href="https://twitter.com/aaronp613/status/1775273274039259349">by Aaron Perris</a>, MDM solutions can enforce an iOS beta version during Automated Device Enrollment starting with the iOS 17.5 beta.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Code Changes</h2><br/>
<br/>
<h3>Battery Health Menu for Future iPads</h3><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/04/iPad-Battery-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="1990" height="1120" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-944716" /><br/>
The first iPadOS 17.5 beta added <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/03/ipados-17-5-beta-battery-health-code/">several new references to a Battery Health menu on the iPad</a>, but the feature is not actually visible yet. The menu is expected to show an iPad battery's maximum remaining capacity and charge cycle count.<br/>
<br/>
A sample of the code strings added in the iPadOS 17.5 beta:<br/>
<br/>
<ul><li>"iPad must be regularly used while not connected to power to show maximum capacity."</li><br/>
<li>"This is the number of times iPad has used your battery's capacity."</li><br/>
<li>"The iPad battery is performing as expected."</li><br/>
<li>"iPad batteries, like all rechargeable batteries, have a limited lifespan and may eventually need to be serviced or replaced."</li><br/>
<li>"The original battery was designed to retain X capacity at X cycles under ideal conditions. Actual battery performance depends on a number of variables, including how iPad is used and charged regularly. The one-year warranty includes service for defective batteries in addition to rights provided under local consumer laws."</li></ul><br/>
<br/>
There is no visible Battery Health menu on any existing iPad models running the iPadOS 17.5 beta, leading us to believe that the menu may be limited to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/28/new-ipad-models-may-launch/">new iPad Pro and iPad Air models that are expected to launch this month</a>, and likely other new iPads released in the future. Apple has shown battery capacity information on iPhones for many years, but cycle count information is currently <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/20/iphone-15-shows-battery-cycle-count/">limited to the latest iPhone 15 series</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<h3>New Apple Pencil</h3><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/apple-pencil.jpeg" alt="" width="2048" height="1152" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-939786" /><br/>
In the iPadOS 17.5 beta, there are potential references to a new fourth-generation Apple Pencil, amid rumors that the accessory will be updated soon.<br/>
<br/>
The beta includes a hidden code reference to a "V4" version of the Apple Pencil:<blockquote>NumberOfApplePencilV1ConnectionsCount<br/>
NumberOfApplePencilV2ConnectionsCount<br/>
NumberOfApplePencilV3ConnectionsCount<br/>
NumberOfApplePencilV4ConnectionsCount</blockquote>A new Apple Pencil is rumored to launch <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/28/new-ipad-models-may-launch/">alongside updated iPad Pro and iPad Air models this month</a>. Apple refers to the USB-C version of the Apple Pencil released last year as the third-generation Apple Pencil in iOS code, so the fourth-generation model would be a new version that would likely succeed the second-generation Apple Pencil.<br/>
<br/>
Additional code in the iOS 17.5 beta suggests that the Apple Pencil could gain a "squeeze" gesture for certain actions, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/28/ipad-pro-m4-chip-and-apple-pencil-haptic-rumors/">haptic feedback is also expected</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<h3>Third-Party Item Tracker Alerts</h3><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/05/AirTag-and-iPhone-Notification-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1082" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-894205" /><br/>
Apple and Google last year <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/02/apple-to-expand-unwanted-tracking-alerts/">jointly announced</a> a proposed industry specification to help combat the misuse of Bluetooth item trackers for unwanted tracking of individuals. As part of this initiative, Apple promised to expand AirTag-like "Found Moving With You" alerts to third-party item trackers in a future software update, which turns out to be iOS 17.5.<br/>
<br/>
The first iOS 17.5 beta added <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/03/ios-17-5-third-party-item-tracker-alerts/">references to alerts for third-party item trackers</a>. For example: "You can disable this item and stop it from sharing its location with the owner. To do this, follow the instructions provided on a website by the manufacturer of this item."<br/>
<br/>
Tile, Chipolo, Samsung, Eufy, and Pebblebee all expressed support for the industry specification, according to <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2023/05/apple-google-partner-on-an-industry-specification-to-address-unwanted-tracking/">Apple's announcement</a> last year.<br/>
<br/>
In related news, Google launched <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/08/google-android-find-my-device-network-2/">its own Find My Device network</a> last month.<br/>
<br/>
<h3>Block All Participants in Group FaceTime Calls</h3><br/>
iOS 17.5 beta code indicates that there may be a new "Block All Participants" option for group FaceTime calls, which could help users to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/16/group-facetime-spam-calls/">fight spam</a>.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-17/">iPadOS 17</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-17.241">iOS 17</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-17.242">iPadOS 17</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/06/apple-says-ios-17-5-coming-soon/">Apple Says iOS 17.5 Coming &#039;Soon&#039; With These New Features for iPhones</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-says-ios-17-5-coming-soon-with-these-new-features-for-iphones.2425530/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2024/05/apples-2024-pride-collection-shines-light-on-lgbtq-plus-communities/">announced</a> a new Pride Edition Braided Solo Loop Apple Watch band, watch face, and wallpaper.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/2024-Apple-Watch-Pride-Face-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-949207" /><br/>
The band features a fluorescent design inspired by multiple pride flags with a laser-etched lug that reads "PRIDE 2024." Black, Hispanic, and Latin communities, as well as those impacted by HIV/AIDS, are represented on the band by the black and brown colors, while transgender and non-binary individuals and represented by the pink, light blue, and white colors.<br/>
<br/>
The band is accompanied by a new Pride Radiance watch face and wallpaper for iOS and iPadOS, in which beams of light glow against a dark background and stack on top of each other. On the Apple Watch, the colors trace each numeral of the watch face and react in real time as the wearer moves their wrist based on gyroscope input. On the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>, beams of color spell out "Pride" and dynamically move when the user unlocks the device. For the first time, the Pride watch face and wallpapers can be customized to show specific colors representing LGBTQ+ communities. <br/>
<br/>
The new braided Solo Loop will be available starting May 22. The new Pride Radiance watch face and &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; wallpaper will be available "soon" with the release of watchOS 10.5, iOS 17.5, and iPadOS 17.5.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-watch-bands/">Apple Watch Bands</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/06/apple-unveils-2024-pride-edition-band/">Apple Unveils 2024 Pride Edition Braided Solo Loop Band and Watch Face</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-unveils-2024-pride-edition-braided-solo-loop-band-and-watch-face.2425521/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple will hold its first media event of 2024 on Tuesday, May 7, at 7:00 a.m. Pacific Time through a live stream. Titled "Let Loose," the event is expected to see the unveiling of new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/">iPad Air</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a> models, along with updated <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-pencil/">Apple Pencil</a> and Magic Keyboard accessories.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2O7X1Lkphuo?si=9ySVCB5lA5woQjwK" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><br/>
There are several ways to watch the May 7 event, with details listed below. We've also included a useful guide on when the event will take place in your particular time zone.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Apple Events Website</h2><br/>
With the <a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-events/">Apple Events website</a>, you can watch the event live on a Mac, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>, PC, or any other device with a web browser. The Apple Events website works in Safari, Chrome, Firefox, and other main browsers.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/04/apple-events-website-let-loose.jpg" alt="" width="2532" height="1520" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-947886" /><br/>
Just navigate to <a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-events/">www.apple.com/apple-events/</a> using a web browser at the appropriate time to watch. You can visit the site now to add an event reminder to your calendar.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>YouTube</h2><br/>
Apple also plans to stream the event live on YouTube, which is perhaps the easiest and most efficient way to watch because the YouTube live stream can be viewed on every platform where YouTube is available, which is pretty much all platforms, from smartphones and tablets to consoles and smart TVs.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/f1J38FlDKxo?si=bcebV5JQN1S1ySNw" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><br/>
Apple has posted a placeholder for the May 7 event on YouTube, and you can visit it now to set an event reminder through YouTube.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Apple TV App</h2><br/>
Apple used to have a dedicated Apple Events app on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a>, but ahead of WWDC in June 2020, it <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2020/06/18/events-app-apple-tv-app-wwdc/">folded into the Apple TV app</a>. On event day, there will be a prominent &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj; app section dedicated to the live stream, which can be watched on any device where the &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj; app is available.<br/>
<br/>
This includes the &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj;, iPhones, iPads, Macs, and some smart TVs. If you have an &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj;, the &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj; app is one of the best ways to watch the event live. Apple hasn't updated the &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj; app with the new event as of yet, but it should be added soon.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Event Time Zones</h2><br/>
Apple's "Let Loose" event will take place at 7:00 a.m. Pacific Time, which is an earlier start than usual, so keep that in mind if you're used to operating on Apple's more traditional event schedule. Event times in other time zones are listed below.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[It's been a long time since the last one, but an Apple event is finally right around the corner! While it's anticipated to be a fairly short pre-recorded affair, we're expecting to see the first updates to the iPad lineup in over a year and half, so make sure to tune in to see what Apple has in store.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/top-stories-4may2024.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-949129" /><br/>
Other news and rumors this week included a couple of product introductions from Apple's Beats brand, a roundup of rumors about updates to Apple's stock apps coming in iOS 18, and more changes to Apple's policies in the EU related to the Digital Markets Act, so read on below for all the details!<br/>
<br/>
<h2>What to Expect From the May 7 Apple Event</h2><br/>
Apple's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/23/apple-event-let-loose-may-7/">first event of 2024 kicks off on Tuesday, May 7,</a> at 7 a.m. Pacific Time, and we've <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/what-to-expect-may-7-event/">put together our usual pre-event guide</a> outlining what we're expecting to see on Tuesday. Several new products are expected to be unveiled, including two new iPad Pro models, two new iPad Air models, an updated Apple Pencil, and a redesigned Magic Keyboard for iPads.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/Let-Loose-Event-What-to-Expect-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2250" height="1265" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-949123" /><br/>
One rumor was particularly surprising this week, as <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman said there is a "strong possibility" that the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/28/ipad-pro-m4-chip-and-apple-pencil-haptic-rumors/">new iPad Pro models will be equipped with Apple's next-generation M4 chip</a>, rather than the M3 chip that debuted in the MacBook Pro and iMac six months ago. Gurman believes the M4 chip will have an upgraded Neural Engine that is able to process artificial intelligence (AI) tasks faster.<br/>
<br/>
In addition, the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/28/ipad-pro-m4-chip-and-apple-pencil-haptic-rumors/">new Apple Pencil is rumored to feature haptic feedback</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Will the New iPad Pro Really Have the M4 Chip?</h2><br/>
<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/01/will-the-new-ipad-pro-really-have-m4/">Will the next iPad Pro models be equipped with the M4 chip</a> instead of the M3 chip, or will this rumor end up being as wrong as the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/05/19/prosser-apple-watch-series-7-design/">flat-edged Apple Watch Series 7</a> from a few years ago?<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/M4-iPad-Pro-Thumb-2.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-949125" /><br/>
While it would be unprecedented for an M-series chip to debut in an iPad before a Mac, there is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/01/will-the-new-ipad-pro-really-have-m4/">some evidence to suggest that the rumor might be true</a>, so check out our story for more details about this possibility.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Beats Solo Buds Launching in June for Just &#36;79.99</h2><br/>
Apple unveiled two new Beats headphone models this week, including the on-ear <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/30/beats-solo-4-launch/">Beats Solo 4</a> and the compact <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/30/beats-solo-buds-announced/">Beats Solo Buds</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/04/beats-solo-buds-purple.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-948605" /><br/>
Launching in June, the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/30/beats-solo-buds-announced/">Beats Solo Buds are particularly interesting</a> given their competitive &#36;79.99 price point. Key features include ear tips with four size options, up to 18 hours of battery life, a USB-C carrying case, and Find My support on iOS and Android. However, the Solo Buds lack active noise cancellation, and the carrying case does not have a built-in battery.<br/>
<br/>
In other Beats news, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/20/lebron-james-unreleased-beats-pill/">LeBron James</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/02/unreleased-beats-pill-daniel-ricciardo/">Daniel Ricciardo</a> have been seen in public carrying an unreleased speaker very clearly descended from the discontinued Beats Pill family, so it looks like the popular portable speaker may be making a comeback in the not too distant future.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>iOS 18 Rumored to Add New Features to These 16 Apps on Your iPhone</h2><br/>
Apple's annual developers conference WWDC is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/26/apple-announces-wwdc-2024/">now under six weeks away</a>, and that means the iOS 18 beta is just around the corner.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/04/iOS-18-Apple-Music-Messages-and-Notes-Feature-1.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-948782" /><br/>
iOS 18 is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/30/ios-18-rumor-recap-for-apps/">rumored to include major upgrades to many built-in iPhone apps</a>, including Apple Music, Messages, Calculator, Notes, Safari, and others. We recently <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/30/ios-18-rumor-recap-for-apps/">recapped new features that are expected on a per-app basis</a>, so check out the list for a complete overview.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Apple Confirms iPadOS Will Get Same EU App Changes as iOS This Fall</h2><br/>
All of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/19/iphone-changes-coming-to-eu-users/">app-related changes</a> recently introduced on iPhones in the EU <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/02/ipados-eu-app-changes-fall/">will also be available on iPads in the EU starting later this fall</a>, according to Apple.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/iPad-Air-5.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="675" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-938463" /><br/>
This news comes after the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/29/eu-says-ipados-digital-gatekeeper-dma/">EU ruled that the iPad is a "gatekeeper" platform</a>. Apple has six months to comply with the Digital Markets Act on the iPad, so alternative app marketplaces, support for web browser engines other than WebKit, and more will likely be available by iPadOS 18.1.<br/>

<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple is set to hold its first event of the year next Tuesday, and the focus will be on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>. The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/">iPad Air</a> models are set to be updated, and Apple also plans to refresh some of its &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; accessories.<br/>
<br/>

This guide features details on everything that we're expecting to see at the "Let Loose" event that will take place on May 7.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="ipad_pro">iPad Pro</h2><br/>
The &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; models will be the star of Apple's event, featuring the first larger form factor OLED displays. OLED display technology will bring deeper blacks, better contrast, more vibrant colors, and better power efficiency.<br/>
<br/>
Apple is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/29/ipad-pro-best-oled-panels/">said to be using</a> the "best OLED panels on the market" with higher brightness, extended battery life, 120Hz ProMotion refresh rates, and a long lifetime for the OLED technology. OLED displays have pixels that can be controlled individually, so high dynamic range content looks more realistic and true-to-life.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/03/iPad-Pro-2024-Will-Be-a-Huge-Upgrade-Thumb-1.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-936070" /><br/>
The &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; models will be available in 11.1-inch and 12.9-inch sizes, and both models will be thinner with slimmed down bezels. The 11.1-inch &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; is expected to be 5.1mm thick, down from 5.9mm, while the 12.9-inch model will be 5mm thick, down from 6.4mm. The tablets will be roughly the same size as the current models, with small changes to the length and width.<br/>
<br/>
It's not entirely clear which M-series chip the &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; models will use, and there is a possibility that these will be the first devices equipped with the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/01/will-the-new-ipad-pro-really-have-m4/">AI-focused next-generation M4 chip</a>. If that doesn't happen, Apple will use the M3 that's in the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/">iMac</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/">MacBook Air</a>. Either way, it'll mark a massive improvement.<br/>
<br/>
Along with slimmed down bezels, the &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj;'s front-facing camera is expected to be relocated to the side of the device rather than the top, so the camera will be upright when the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; is in a landscape orientation. That makes more sense for video calls and filming done when the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; is used with a keyboard.<br/>
<br/>
There have been rumors of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/18/ipad-pro-magsafe-charging/">possible MagSafe charging support</a> and up to 4TB of storage, and we <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/23/how-much-oled-ipad-pro-models-cost/">could also see prices go up</a>. Multiple sources have said that the OLED technology will make the 2024 &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; models more expensive, but just how much more expensive remains to be seen. Rumors have ranged from &#36;160 more to &#36;700 more.<br/>
<br/>
For more on the rumors that we've heard so far about the &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj;, we have a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/oled-ipad-pro/">dedicated 2024 iPad Pro guide</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="ipad_air">iPad Air</h2><br/>
The &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; will get a refresh alongside the &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj;, and for the first time, Apple is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/05/apple-two-ipad-air-models/">splitting the Air lineup</a> and introducing two models. The first &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; will be a direct successor to the current version, measuring in at 10.9 inches. The second model will come in at 12.9 inches, similar to the &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/iPad-Air-12.9-Inch-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2192" height="1233" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-917813" /><br/>
Offering the &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; in two screen sizes will allow customers who want a large screen at a more affordable price than the &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; to have that option. The 10.9 and 12.9-inch &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; models will not have the same OLED screen technology Apple is bringing to the &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj;, instead using LCD, and that will keep costs lower.<br/>
<br/>
We are not expecting design changes to the &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj;, except for the new, larger size. Both models will look like the &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; 4, featuring an edge-to-edge display with slim bezels and an aluminum chassis with flat, rounded edges. The &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; will be thicker than the &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj;, and it will have thicker bezels.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/20/next-gen-ipad-air-with-12-9-inch-display-and-redesigned-camera-unit-revealed-in-cad-renders/">Leaked iPad Air images</a> point to a rear camera with a protruding pill-shaped camera bump that's similar to the design we're expecting to see with the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a>. The front camera could be repositioned so that it will be at the top of the &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; when it's in landscape mode, allowing it to be in the right orientation for video calls when it's used with a keyboard. The current version has the camera at the top when it is in portrait mode.<br/>
<br/>
While we won't see notable design updates, Apple may introduce new color options. The existing model comes in a range of pastel shades, so Apple could tweak the color selection.<br/>
<br/>
We have more on what's expected for the &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/2024-ipad-air/">in our iPad Air guide</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="apple_pencil">Apple Pencil</h2><br/>
The &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; will be accompanied by an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-pencil-3/">updated version of the Apple Pencil</a>, which Apple might call the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-pencil/">Apple Pencil</a> 3. It isn't yet clear if there will be design changes, but it is expected to be the first &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; that supports haptic feedback.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/06/black-and-white-apple-pencil-feature.jpg" alt="" width="2664" height="1500" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-744328" /><br/>
How that haptic feedback will be used remains to be seen, but code in iOS 17.5 suggested there will be <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/03/ios-17-5-apple-pencil-4-rumor/">a "squeeze" gesture</a> that could do things like activate different tools and settings in apps.<br/>
<br/>
There were rumors of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/02/apple-pencil-3-could-feature-magnetic-tips/">interchangeable magnetic tips</a> at one point, but we don't know if that's actually a feature that's coming or an inaccurate rumor. Deeper integration with the Vision Pro is a possibility, and it could perhaps work with drawing apps that support <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/visionos/">visionOS</a>. There's also a chance that we could see the &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; come in both black and white rather than just white.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="magic_keyboard">Magic Keyboard</h2><br/>
Apple plans to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/08/magic-keyboard-apple-pencil-rumors/">overhaul the Magic Keyboard</a>, introducing a sturdier frame <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/03/gurman-new-ipad-magic-keyboard-to-feature-aluminum/">made from aluminum</a> rather than the polyurethane material used for the current version. While the frame and area around the keyboard will be made from aluminum, the exterior shell will still be made from silicone.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/05/magic-keyboard-yellow-1.jpg" alt="" width="2250" height="1266" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-844768" /><br/>
With the aluminum build, an &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; and Magic Keyboard combo will more closely resemble a MacBook, both in terms of looks and functionality. There will be a larger trackpad that is similar to the trackpad on a MacBook, so the keyboard will offer a MacBook-like typing and navigating experience.<br/>
<br/>
Apple is using more premium materials for the new Magic Keyboard, so it could be more expensive. The current model is priced starting at &#36;299 for the 11-inch version. The new Magic Keyboard is likely to work with both the upcoming &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; models as they are similar in size (11.1 and 12.9 inches for the &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; and 10.9 and 12.9 inches for the &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj;).<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="other_accessories">Other Accessories</h2><br/>
Apple refreshes its selection of Apple Watch bands, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> cases, and &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; cases regularly, introducing new color options. We could see new summer colors for many accessories, and Apple will need to update its &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; cases to accommodate the new designs. <br/>

		<description><![CDATA[On this week's episode of <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/new-ipad-pro-with-the-m4-chip-for-ai/id1602394741?i=1000654446813">The MacRumors Show</a>, we discuss the possibility of the next-generation <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a> featuring the M4 chip and what else to expect at <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/23/apple-event-let-loose-may-7/">Apple's "Let loose" event</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/E-_X7QiOpbk?si=325F4iU3xFJphpZe" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@themacrumorsshow?sub_confirmation=1">Subscribe to The MacRumors Show YouTube channel</a> for more videos</em></div> <br/>
While Apple's upcoming &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; models have been expected to feature the M3 chip for over a year, recent reports have unexpectedly suggested that the new devices will instead contain the as-yet-unannounced M4 chip and that a key new feature of the processor will be an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/14/iphone-16-upgraded-neural-engine-rumor/">upgraded Neural Engine</a> optimized for AI tasks. Introducing the M4 chip in an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> and only six months after the previous chip generation would be unprecedented moves, but there is evidence to suggest that it is a plausible possibility. <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Apple's "Let loose" event is expected to focus on the unveiling of redesigned &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; models with OLED displays, two new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/">iPad Air</a> models, a high-end Magic Keyboard accessory, and a new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-pencil/">Apple Pencil</a>. We also talk through the three other announcements that Apple could have in store for the event. <br/>
<br/>
The special event will take place on Tuesday, May 7, at 7 a.m. Pacific Time (10 a.m. Eastern Time), with a live stream to be available on Apple.com and on YouTube as usual. <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/the-macrumors-show/">The MacRumors Show</a> is now on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@themacrumorsshow">its own YouTube channel</a>, so make sure you're subscribed to keep up with new episodes and clips going forward:<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[This year's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a> lineup could see a slight change to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe-battery-pack/">MagSafe</a> alignment magnets compared to previous generations, according to <a href="https://shop.appsystem.fr/blogs/blog/exclusivite-maquette-iphone16-anneau-magsafe">images shared by French case company ShopSystem</a> [<a href="https://shop-appsystem-fr.translate.goog/blogs/blog/exclusivite-maquette-iphone16-anneau-magsafe?_x_tr_sl=auto&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=en-US">Google Translate</a>].<br/>

Casemaking molds for the &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; lineup appear to show a thinner design for the attachment ring magnets and for the single alignment magnet, relative to equivalent molds for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a> lineup. The report suggests &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; accessory manufacturers may need to adapt their products to fit the new system, but this seems very unlikely as any updated &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; system will almost certainly be backwards compatible.<br/>
<br/>

Presuming the thinner magnets depicted in these molds are accurate, it's unclear if there are additional changes to &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; in the upcoming <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> lineup that could extend to the charging technology. One rumor has, however, indicated the &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; lineup <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/07/17/iphone-15-could-feature-stacked-battery-technology/">could see increased MagSafe charging speeds</a> with support for up to 20 watts compared to the current standard of 15 watts.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/">iPhone 16 Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe/">MagSafe</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/03/iphone-16-slimmer-magsafe/">iPhone 16 Lineup Could Feature Slimmer MagSafe Components</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-16-lineup-could-feature-slimmer-magsafe-components.2425387/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/">iPhone 16 Pro</a> is set to succeed 2023's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a>, introducing <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone-15-pro-vs-iphone-16-pro/">over 25 new features</a> and improvements to Apple's high-end smartphones. With many users adopting two-year upgrade cycles, plenty of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-14/">iPhone 14</a> Pro owners will be looking to upgrade to the &zwnj;iPhone 16 Pro&zwnj; later this year, so this guide breaks down every major difference you should be aware of between the two generations based on rumors. <br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/iPhone-14-Pro-vs-16-Pro-Feature-2.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-937778" /></div><br/>
In 2022, Apple unveiled the &zwnj;iPhone 14&zwnj; Pro as the successor to the popular <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-13/">iPhone 13</a> Pro, introducing an always-on display, the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/dynamic-island/">Dynamic Island</a>, a 48-megapixel camera, the A16 Bionic chip, longer battery life, and more. Two years later, the &zwnj;iPhone 16 Pro&zwnj; is expected to offer over 50 upgrades. All of the changes the &zwnj;iPhone 16 Pro&zwnj; models are rumored to feature compared to their 2022 predecessor are listed below, using information from reliable sources that we have <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/">previously covered</a>. We will update this article as more rumors emerge in the coming months.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="design">Design</h2><br/>
The design of the &zwnj;iPhone 16 Pro&zwnj; is expected to be a relatively significant evolution over the &zwnj;iPhone 14&zwnj; Pro, iterating on the titanium frame and slightly rounded edges introduced on the &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; models last year. <br/>
<br/>

<div class="clear"></div><br/>
<br/>
<h3 id="dimensions">Dimensions</h3><br/>
To accommodate larger displays, both &zwnj;iPhone 16 Pro&zwnj; models are rumored to grow in height and width. In addition to last year's increase in depth, the devices are due to be considerably larger, but with a notable reduction in weight thanks to the adoption of a titanium frame. <br/>

<br/>
<h2 id="displays">Displays</h2><br/>
Both &zwnj;iPhone 16 Pro&zwnj; models are expected to feature larger displays than their predecessors, pushing the &zwnj;iPhone 16 Pro&zwnj; Max to be the biggest <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> ever offered. There are also reportedly improvements to the underlying OLED technology in store, in addition to last year's slimmer bezels, making for a noticeable overall display upgrade.<br/>

<h2 id="will_it_be_worth_upgrading">Will It Be Worth Upgrading?</h2><br/>
The &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; was a fairly significant upgrade over the &zwnj;iPhone 14&zwnj; Pro in 2023, introducing a titanium chassis, slimmer bezels, the Action button, and a USB-C port. The &zwnj;iPhone 16 Pro&zwnj; will build on these upgrades, offering larger displays, the Capture button, and improved cameras. With over 50 upgrades likely to be in store, many &zwnj;iPhone 14&zwnj; Pro users will find upgrading to an &zwnj;iPhone 16 Pro&zwnj; model worthwhile.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/">iPhone 16 Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99">iPhone</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone-14-pro-vs-iphone-16-pro/">iPhone 14 Pro vs. iPhone 16 Pro: 50+ Upgrades to Expect</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-14-pro-vs-iphone-16-pro-50-upgrades-to-expect.2420302/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple system features such as <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a> and Spotlight Search are set to receive new AI features that work across apps like Messages, Mail, and Safari, <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/24/05/03/siri-for-ios-18-to-gain-massive-ai-upgrade-via-apples-ajax-llm?utm_medium=rss"><em>AppleInsider</em></a> reports.<br/>

Safari will apparently gain a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/30/safari-ai-features-coming-in-ios-18/">text summarization tool called Intelligent Browsing</a> that allows users to generate a short summary of any webpage, and &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; could gain a similar feature that works in the Messages app. Apple's AI technology can apparently analyze message content and generate responses. Spotlight search will be enhanced with more intelligent results and improved sorting, working across apps like Contacts and Calendar to generate responses.<br/>
<br/>
Crucially, Apple's AI tools run-on device, with the ability to generate responses without any cloud-based processing, to maximize privacy and minimize delays. More advanced replies and summaries seem to require sever-side processing. Apple is widely expected to unveil the suite of AI features when it previews major updates to its operating systems at WWDC in June.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a></div><div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/appleinsider-com/">AppleInsider</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/artificial-intelligence/">Artificial Intelligence</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/03/ios-18-ai-features-for-siri-spotlight-revealed/">iOS 18&#039;s Rumored AI Features for Siri, Spotlight, and More Revealed in New Report</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-18s-rumored-ai-features-for-siri-spotlight-and-more-revealed-in-new-report.2425378/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple is holding at least five announcements for later in the year that will not arrive at the company's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/23/apple-event-let-loose-may-7/">"Let loose" special event</a> next week, according to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-05-03/apple-ipad-event-2024-new-ipad-pro-air-magic-keyboard-pencil-coming-may-7"><em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/04/Apple-Event-Let-Loose-Pastel-Green.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-947825" /><br/>
In a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-05-03/apple-ipad-event-2024-new-ipad-pro-air-magic-keyboard-pencil-coming-may-7">report</a> detailing his expectations for Apple's upcoming event, Gurman noted that there are a total of five things that the company is holding for later in the year:<br/>
<br/>
<ul><br/>
	<li><strong>AI features</strong>: While Apple may tease new AI capabilities with the next-generation <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a>, Apple will not "formally unveil" the features until WWDC in June where iPadOS 18 will be previewed.</li><br/>
	<li><strong>Lower-cost entry-level iPad</strong>: Apple is apparently working on a version of the 10th-generation <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> introduced in 2022 with a lower price. The current model is &#36;449, sitting in the lineup above the &#36;329 ninth-generation &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; that remains in the lineup. The company is likely to phase out this older model and bring the price down of the redesigned model, but Gurman says this "isn't expected until the end of the year at the earliest."</li><br/>
	<li><strong>Seventh-generation iPad mini</strong>: A refreshed <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-mini/">iPad mini</a> is said to be in the works featuring improved performance thanks to a faster chip, but it is not due to be announced next week.</li><br/>
	<li><strong>New Macs</strong>: While the new &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; models <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/01/will-the-new-ipad-pro-really-have-m4/">may contain the M4 chip</a>, a processor that will later come to the Mac, Apple is not planning to unveil any new Mac models at the "Let loose" event.</li><br/>
	<li><strong>Fourth-generation AirPods</strong>: Apple is said to be nearing production of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airpods-4/">fourth-generation AirPods</a>, but these will not launch until the fall alongside the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a> lineup.</li><br/>
</ul><br/>
<br/>
Apple's "Let loose" event is expected to focus on the unveiling of redesigned &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; models with OLED displays, two new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/">iPad Air</a> models, a high-end Magic Keyboard accessory, and a new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-pencil/">Apple Pencil</a>. It will take place on Tuesday, May 7 at 7 a.m. Pacific Time (10 a.m. Eastern Time), with a live stream to be available on Apple.com and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1J38FlDKxo">on YouTube</a> as usual.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/bloomberg-com/">Bloomberg</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/may-2024-apple-event/">May 2024 Apple Event</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/03/five-things-apple-wont-launch-next-week/">Report: Five Things Apple Won&#039;t Announce at Its Event Next Week</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/report-five-things-apple-wont-announce-at-its-event-next-week.2425376/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple is working to introduce a new fourth-generation Apple silicon chip across the Mac lineup, and while the first M4 Macs are coming in 2024, the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/">MacBook Air</a> won't get updated until 2025.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/macbook-air-m2-13-inch.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-939833" /><br/>
This guide highlights everything that we know about the next-generation &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; so far.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="m4_chips">M4 Chips</h2><br/>
The 13-inch and 15-inch &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; models were just updated with M3 chips in March 2024, so it's no surprise that they're not going to be the first devices to get the M4 chip. Apple plans to wait until 2025, so there will be about a year between the M3 and M4 chip lineups.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/04/M4-AI-Optimized-Feature-Teal.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-945901" /><br/>
Rumors suggest that the M4 chip will have a focus on artificial intelligence to support AI features that are coming with the next round of software updates. Most AI talk has been about <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a>, but Apple is expected to roll out AI integrations across its platforms. The M4 chip is expected to have a Neural Engine with more cores, with the Neural Engine handling AI and machine learning tasks. The M3 chip has a 16-core Neural Engine.<br/>
<br/>
While Apple is working on M4, M4 Pro, M4 Max, and M4 Ultra chips, the &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; models are expected to get only the standard M4 chip. There will likely be at least two variants of the M4, with the difference being the number of GPU cores. For the current &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj;, for example, the base M3 chip has an 8-core GPU, but there is also a 10-core GPU option. The M3 CPU is the same for all versions, and that should be the case with the M4 as well.<br/>
<br/>
The M4 will be built on Apples 3-nanometer process, much like the M3. There won't be as big of a performance improvement between M3 and M4 as there was between <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m2/">M2</a> and M3 because there's no change in node size, but we can still expect modest GPU and CPU speed boosts.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="design">Design</h2><br/>
Apple overhauled the &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; design in 2022, and we're not expecting the design to be tweaked with the 2025 refresh. Apple often waits several years between design changes, and there are no rumors that there will be a refreshed look.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/04/macbook-air-m3-green.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-945032" /><br/>
Apple is likely to stick with the 15.3 and 13.6-inch size options, and we can expect to see the same flat, MacBook Pro-style body with Force Touch trackpad, and display with notch. As of now, it looks like the 2025 &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; refresh will be focused on internal updates.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="launch_date">Launch Date</h2><br/>
According to <em>Bloomberg</em>'s <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a>, the &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; will get an update in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/11/m4-ai-chips-late-2024/">the spring of 2025</a>. Spring starts on March 20, 2025, and ends on June 20, 2025.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/">MacBook Air</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#15-MacBook-Air">15" MacBook Air (Buy Now)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Air">13" MacBook Air (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macbook-air.122">MacBook Air</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/2025-macbook-air/">Apple&#039;s 2025 M4 MacBook Air: What to Expect</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apples-2025-m4-macbook-air-what-to-expect.2425353/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>
