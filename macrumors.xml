		<description><![CDATA[Most of us stare at our iPhones for far too long, and this constant exposure to a bright screen can strain our eyes, especially in low-light conditions or during the twilight hours. That's where the ability to dim your iPhone screen beyond the standard brightness settings becomes a game-changer. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/04/iphone-in-bed.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-948101" /><br/>
If the screen of your iPhone or iPad is too bright for comfort, the usual solution is to go to Settings ➝ Display & Brightness and drag the Brightness slider to the left, or open Control Center and adjust the corresponding setting from there. However, if the lowest setting offered by the Brightness level just isn't dim enough for you, there's another way to make your screen even darker. <br/>
<br/>
This feature is particularly useful if you find yourself needing to use your device in dark environments, such as in a bedroom where a partner is sleeping, or in a dimly lit theater. It's also a boon for anyone with light sensitivity, providing a more comfortable viewing experience that minimizes eye strain and fatigue. Let's look at how to set it up below.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Reduce White Point</h2><br/>
<ol><br/>
  <li>Open Settings on your iPhone.</li><br/>
  <li>Select <strong>Accessibility</strong> from the list of options.</li><br/>
  <li>Scroll down and select <strong>Accessibility Shortcut</strong>.</li><br/>
  <li>Tap <strong>Reduce White Point</strong>, then drag it up near the top of the list using the three lines icon.</li><br/>
</ol><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/reduce-white-point-setup.jpg" alt="settings" width="4137" height="2716" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-942525" /><br/>
<br/>
Now that's set up, simply triple-click your iPhone's <strong>Side button</strong> to display the Accessibility Shortcut menu, then tap <strong>Reduce White Point</strong>. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/reduce-white-point.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-942527" /><br/>
Your iPhone display will now be dimmer than the dimmest setting offered by the standard Brightness level.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Reset White Point</h2><br/>
To return the white point to its normal level, simply triple-click the <strong>Side button</strong> again and tap <strong>Reduce White Point</strong> to uncheck it. <br/>
<br/>
<h2>Adjust White Point</h2><br/>
If the White Point is still too bright (or too dim), you can adjust it manually: In Settings, go to <strong>Accessibility ➝ Display & Text Size</strong>, then scroll down and turn on the switch next to <strong>Reduce White Point</strong>. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/adjust-white-point.jpg" alt="settings" width="4137" height="2716" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-942529" /><br/>
This will reveal a slider that you can move left or right to change the brightness level.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Trigger Reduced White Point at Bedtime</h2><br/>
It's possible to make the Reduced White Point setting come on when Bedtime starts, or when your Sleep focus is enabled. This offers an automated approach to minimizing screen brightness, which is particularly beneficial for winding down before bedtime. <br/>
<br/>
Blue light is known for its potential to disrupt natural sleep patterns by inhibiting the production of melatonin, a hormone crucial for sleep regulation. That makes an automation especially useful if you have a habit of reading or browsing on your iPhone as part of your nighttime routine, allowing you to do so without significantly impacting your sleep quality. Here's how it's done.<br/>
<ol><br/>
  <li>Open the Shortcuts app, then tap the <strong>+</strong> icon in the top-right corner of the screen.</li><br/>
  <li>Tap <strong>Add Action</strong>.<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/add-action-shortcuts.jpg" alt="shortcuts" width="2738" height="2716" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-942532" /><br/>
  <li>Type "White Point" in the search field, then choose <strong>Set White Point</strong> when it appears below.</li><br/>
  <li>Tap the blue "Turn" text, then choose <strong>Toggle</strong> from the dropdown menu.</li><br/>
  <li>Tap <strong>Done</strong> in the top-right corner of the screen.<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/toggle-white-point-shortcut.jpg" alt="shortcuts" width="4137" height="2716" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-942533" /><br/>
</ol>After following the above steps, you should see your new "Set White Point" shortcut in the Shortcuts menu. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/set-white-point-shortcut-gallery.jpg" alt="shortcuts" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-942541" /><br/>
The Shortcut is now ready to use in a new custom automation. It's easy to make, just follow these steps.<br/>
<ol><br/>
  <li>In the Shortcuts app, select the <strong>Automation</strong> tab, then tap the <strong>+</strong> icon in the top-right corner of the screen.</li><br/>
  <li>Under "Personal Automation," choose <strong>Sleep</strong>.<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/white-point-bedtime1.jpg" alt="shortcuts" width="2738" height="2716" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-942534" /><br/>
  <li>On the "When" screen, choose <strong>Bedtime Begins</strong> and <strong>Run Immediately</strong>, then tap <strong>Next</strong>.</li><br/>
  <li>On the "When Bedtime Starts" screen, choose your custom <strong>Set White Point</strong> shortcut.<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/white-point-bedtime2.jpg" alt="shortcuts" width="2738" height="2716" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-942535" /><br/>
</ol>You're all done. In the future, when Bedtime starts or when you enable the Sleep focus, your screen's white point will be automatically reduced. <br/>
<br/>
<h2>Trigger White Point When Bedtime Ends</h2><br/>
To make sure the white point on your iPhone's display is reset when bedtime ends in the morning, you just have to create an additional automation. This basically involves the same steps you just used to create the first custom automation, except instead of choosing Bedtime Begins in step 3, select <strong>Waking Up</strong>. Here are those steps again for your convenience, but with a modified step 3.<br/>
<ol><br/>
  <li>In the Shortcuts app, select the <strong>Automation</strong> tab, then tap the <strong>+</strong> icon in the top-right corner of the screen.</li><br/>
  <li>Under "Personal Automation," choose <strong>Sleep</strong>.</li><br/>
  <li>On the "When" screen, choose <strong>Waking Up</strong> and <strong>Run Immediately</strong>, then tap <strong>Next</strong>.</li><br/>
  <li>On the "When Bedtime Starts" screen, choose your custom <strong>Set White Point</strong> shortcut.</li><br/>
</ol>That's it! The white point on your iPhone display will now return to normal when your bedtime ends.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/shortcuts/">Shortcuts</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/make-iphone-display-dimmer-white-point/">How to Make Your iPhone Screen Less Bright in Bed</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/how-to-make-your-iphone-screen-less-bright-in-bed.2424882/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Threads is testing an option that allows users to archive old posts so that they don't appear on their profile, according to Instagram head Adam Mosseri. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/07/instagram-threads-app.jpg" alt="" width="1079" height="607" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-902359" /><br/>
In a <a href="https://www.threads.net/@mosseri/post/C6Jq-r-xVpM">post</a> on the Meta-owned social media platform, Mosseri said that the archive option being tested with a small number of people included a manual setting for individual posts, as well as the ability  to automatically archive all posts after a certain period of time. <br/>
<br/>
Users also have the option to unarchive a post to make it public again. If beta testing goes well, the ability to archive posts is likely to be rolled out globally as an option rather than a default behavior, which Mosseri said was the overwhelming preference based on user feedback.<br/>
<br/>
When it launched back in July, Threads was very barebones, with Meta working to add new functionality on a regular basis to bring the network in line with X (Twitter). It has since gained a web app, an ability to search for posts, and a post editing feature. Just last week, Threads began rolling out an option to some users to <a href="https://www.threads.net/@mosseri/post/C5yvw9LP4j8">filter search results</a> by the most recent posts, rather than just posts suggested by its algorithm. <br/>
<br/>
The slow trickle of new features appears to be gradually paying off: The app now has more than 150 million monthly users, according to Mark Zuckerberg, who revealed the figures on Wednesday during Meta's <a href="https://s21.q4cdn.com/399680738/files/doc_financials/2024/q1/META-Q1-2024-Earnings-Call-Transcript.pdf">first-quarter earnings call</a>. <br/>

The number indicates an increase of about 20 million new users since February, suggesting steady growth, albeit at a slower rate than its initial rapid popularity, when the app racked up 100 million users in its first week. Zuckerberg said in October he believes Threads has a good chance of becoming Meta's next billion-user app.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/threads/">Threads</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/25/threads-tests-archive-option-150m-users/">Threads Tests Option to Archive Posts as Platform Hits 150M+ Users</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/threads-tests-option-to-archive-posts-as-platform-hits-150m-users.2424881/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today <a href="https://developer.apple.com/safari/download/">released a new update</a> for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/safari-technology-preview/">Safari Technology Preview</a>, the experimental browser Apple <a href="http://www.macrumors.com/2016/03/30/apple-safari-technology-preview-browser/">first introduced</a> in March 2016. Apple designed the &zwnj;Safari Technology Preview&zwnj; to test features that may be introduced into future release versions of Safari.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-785724" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/02/Safari-Technology-Preview-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2368" height="1332" /><br/>
&zwnj;Safari Technology Preview&zwnj; 193 includes fixes and updates for Accessibility, CSS, Forms, JavaScript, Rendering, Web API, and Web Inspector.<br/>
<br/>
The current &zwnj;Safari Technology Preview&zwnj; release is compatible with machines running macOS Ventura and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sonoma/">macOS Sonoma</a>, the latest version of macOS that Apple released in September 2023.<br/>
<br/>
The &zwnj;Safari Technology Preview&zwnj; update is available through the Software Update mechanism in System Preferences or System Settings to anyone who has <a href="https://developer.apple.com/safari/download/">downloaded the browser</a>. Full release notes for the update are available <a href="https://developer.apple.com/safari/technology-preview/release-notes/">on the Safari Technology Preview website</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Apple's aim with &zwnj;Safari Technology Preview&zwnj; is to gather feedback from developers and users on its browser development process. &zwnj;Safari Technology Preview&zwnj; can run side-by-side with the existing Safari browser and while designed for developers, it does not require a developer account to download.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Meta-owned messaging platform WhatsApp <a href="https://twitter.com/WhatsApp/status/1783169135221846430">today announced</a> that it is rolling out support for passkeys on iOS, a feature that will let WhatsApp users log in to their accounts on iOS devices using <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mask-face-id/">Face ID</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/touch-id/">Touch ID</a>, or their device passcode.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/03/Whatsapp-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2250" height="1266" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-786421" /><br/>
Passkeys serve as a replacement for a traditional password, and because device authentication is required, passkeys put a stop to online attacks like phishing. With a passkey, there's no password to steal, and no one-time SMS or authentication code that can be intercepted.<br/>
<br/>
Passkeys are also more convenient, because logins are done with a quick &zwnj;Face ID&zwnj; or &zwnj;Touch ID&zwnj; scan rather than a password. WhatsApp passkeys can be enabled by opening up the app settings, choosing the Account section, and tapping on "Passkeys."<br/>
<br/>
Apple has supported passkeys since 2022, and they work on devices that run iOS 16 and later, iPadOS 16 and later, and macOS Ventura and later. Many companies have been implementing support for passkeys, including X (formerly Twitter), Google, TikTok, PayPal, Best Buy, Microsoft, PlayStation, and eBay.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/whatsapp/">WhatsApp</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/24/whatsapp-ios-passkey-support/">WhatsApp for iOS Gains Support for Passkeys</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/whatsapp-for-ios-gains-support-for-passkeys.2424850/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today released several open source large language models (LLMs) that are designed to run on-device rather than through cloud servers. Called OpenELM (Open-source Efficient Language Models), the LLMs are available on <a href="https://huggingface.co/apple/OpenELM">the Hugging Face Hub</a>, a community for sharing AI code.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/04/Apple-Silicon-AI-Optimized-Feature-Siri.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-947745" /><br/>
As outlined in a white paper [<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.14619">PDF</a>], there are eight total OpenELM models, four of which were pre-trained using the CoreNet library, and four instruction tuned models. Apple uses a layer-wise scaling strategy that is aimed at improving accuracy and efficiency.<br/>
<br/>
Apple provided code, training logs, and multiple versions rather than just the final trained model, and the researchers behind the project hope that it will lead to faster progress and "more trustworthy results" in the natural language AI field.<br/>
<blockquote>OpenELM, a state-of-the-art open language model. OpenELM uses a layer-wise scaling strategy to efficiently allocate parameters within each layer of the transformer model, leading to enhanced accuracy. For example, with a parameter budget of approximately one billion parameters, OpenELM exhibits a 2.36% improvement in accuracy compared to OLMo while requiring 2x fewer pre-training tokens.<br/>
<br/>
Diverging from prior practices that only provide model weights and inference code, and pre-train on private datasets, our release includes the complete framework for training and evaluation of the language model on publicly available datasets, including training logs, multiple checkpoints, and pre-training configurations.</blockquote><br/>
Apple says that it is releasing the OpenELM models to "empower and enrich the open research community" with state-of-the-art language models. Sharing open source models gives researchers a way to investigate risks and data and model biases. Developers and companies are able to use the models as-is or make modifications.<br/>
<br/>
The open sharing of information has become an important tool for Apple to recruit top engineers, scientists, and experts because it provides opportunities for research papers that would not normally have been able to be published under Apple's secretive policies.<br/>
<br/>
Apple has not yet brought these kinds of AI capabilities to its devices, but <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a> is expected to include a number of new AI features, and rumors suggest that Apple is planning to run its large language models on-device for privacy purposes.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/artificial-intelligence/">Artificial Intelligence</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/24/apple-ai-open-source-models/">Apple Releases Open Source AI Models That Run On-Device</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-releases-open-source-ai-models-that-run-on-device.2424846/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Spotify has not been able to get Apple to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/14/spotify-no-apple-approval-subscription-update/">approve an EU app update</a> that added information on subscription pricing and links to the Spotify website, and it turns out that's because Spotify has not agreed to the terms of Apple's Music Streaming Services Entitlement.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-801789" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/06/Apple-vs-Spotify-feature2.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" /><br/>
A <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/04/eu-fines-apple-2-billion/">recent antitrust ruling</a> from the European Commission fined Apple nearly &#36;2 billion and mandated that Apple "remove anti-steering provisions" for music apps in the European Economic Area (EEA). As a result, Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/05/app-store-guidelines-emulators-music-app-links/">updated its App Store rules</a> with a Music Streaming Services Entitlement that allows music apps in the EEA to inform users of other ways to purchase digital music content or services and to add website links for purchasing digital music subscriptions.<br/>
<br/>
That might sound like a win for apps like Spotify, but Apple requires developers who use the entitlement to pay a 27 percent fee (reduced for subscriptions older than one year and for small businesses) on all website purchases referred by Apple. So if Spotify puts a link in its app and a user clicks it and subscribes, Spotify would owe Apple a 27 percent commission (three percent less than the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a> purchase fee).<br/>
<br/>
Spotify does not currently pay Apple any money, and it does not want to. Directly after the European Commission's ruling, Spotify on March 5 <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/14/spotify-no-apple-approval-subscription-update/">submitted an EU app update</a> that had information on subscription pricing and links to its websites for customers to make purchases. This was prior to when Apple had announced its entitlement plan.<br/>
<br/>
Apple ignored Spotify's app update, and Spotify <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/14/spotify-no-apple-approval-subscription-update/">complained on March 14</a> that Apple had not "acknowledged or responded" to its &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; submission. Spotify at the time called on the European Commission to force Apple to approve its app update.<br/>
<br/>
Apple kept ignoring Spotify's submission, until today, when Spotify submitted a new version of its app. Spotify said on X (<a href="https://twitter.com/SpotifyNews/status/1783130145605173309">formerly Twitter</a>) that the update has no links and includes just the "bare minimum" on pricing and a mention that subscriptions can be purchased from Spotify, which it claims is acceptable under the European Commission's ruling.<br/>
<br/>
Spotify left out a small detail, though. It turns out that Spotify did not <a href="https://developer.apple.com/support/music-streaming-services-entitlement-eea/">request a Music Streaming Services Entitlement</a> and did not agree to Apple's new terms for the entitlement. The &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; Review Team sent Spotify a letter (via <em><a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/24/04/24/spotify-second-ios-app-update-attempt-in-eu-fails-to-pass-app-store-review">AppleInsider</a></em>) that says the entitlement is required even though there is no link because Spotify's submission has a call to action to purchase a Spotify subscription on its website.<br/>
<blockquote>We are reaching out to let you know about new information regarding your app, Spotify - Music and Podcasts, version 8.9.33.<br/>
<br/>
As you may be aware, Apple created a new Music Streaming Services Entitlement (EEA) for iOS and iPadOS music streaming apps offered in EEA storefronts. The entitlement allows music streaming apps to use buttons, external links, or other calls to action to direct customers to a purchase mechanism on a website owned or controlled by the developer. You must accept its terms before adding any of these capabilities to your app. Please find more information about the entitlement here.<br/>
<br/>
We note that your current submission includes a call to action to purchase a Spotify subscription on your website. As such, you must accept the terms of the Music Streaming Services Entitlement (EEA) and include the entitlement profile in your app for submission. To be clear, this entitlement is required even if your app does not include an external link (nor does it require that you offer an external link). We will, however, approve version 8.9.33 after you accept the terms of the Music Streaming Services Entitlement (EEA) and resubmit it for review.<br/>
<br/>
If you have any questions about this information, please reply to this message to let us know.</blockquote><br/>
Apple says that if Spotify agrees to the terms of the Music Streaming Services Entitlement, it will approve the latest Spotify app update. Without a link to the Spotify website, Spotify would presumably not have to pay Apple a commission because there would be no way for Apple to track clicks from its app to Spotify, but there may be some other part of the entitlement that Spotify is reluctant to agree to.<br/>
<br/>
Apple does not plan to let Spotify include a link to the Spotify website without paying the required 27 percent fee, but adding subscription pricing information without a link does seem to be permitted per the language of Apple's letter to Spotify.<br/>
<br/>
Spotify has confirmed that it does not plan to opt in to Apple's EU &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; business terms, which are separate from the Music Streaming Services Entitlement and are part of the changes that Apple implemented as required by the Digital Markets Act.<br/>
<br/>
Because Spotify does not want to agree to the EU &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; business terms, it is limited on the features that it can add to its app in the EU. To offer the Spotify app directly from its website in the EU, Spotify would need to agree to the terms and would have to pay a 0.50 euro Core Technology Fee for users that download the app.<br/>
<br/>
Spotify does not let customers sign up for a Spotify subscription in the app as of right now, so it does not have to pay anything. Web-based distribution and linking out to the Spotify website both have associated fees, and Spotify is aiming for a solution where it does not have to pay anything. Spotify's full statement on its update, from Chief Public Affairs Officer Dustee Jenkins:<blockquote>Despite Apple's attempts to punish developers with new fees, we remain committed to giving consumers real choice in our app at no increased cost. That's why we have submitted a new update to Apple. It features basic pricing and website information - the bare minimum outlined under the European Commission's ruling in its music streaming case.<br/>
<br/>
By charging developers for communicating with consumers through links in-app, Apple continues to break European law. It's past time for the Commission to enforce its decision so that consumers can see real, positive benefits.</blockquote>Though Spotify has a clear path to get its app update approved, the company claims that Apple is breaking European law by charging the 27 percent fee for links and it calls on the European Commission to "enforce its decision."<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/spotify/">Spotify</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/european-union/">European Union</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/24/apple-spotify-app-store-rules-eu/">Spotify and Apple Again Clash Over App Store Rules and Fees</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/spotify-and-apple-again-clash-over-app-store-rules-and-fees.2424843/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-arcade/">Apple Arcade</a> games Crossy Road Castle and Solitaire Stories are set to launch on the Vision Pro headset tomorrow, adding two additional popular games to Apple's first head worn device.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/04/vision-pro-solitaire-stories.jpg" alt="" width="1500" height="844" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-947995" /><br/>
In Crossy Road Castle, players can progress through tower levels with pinch and flick gestures. Up to four players can play at one time, though there's also a solo version of the game.<br/>
<br/>
Crossy Road Castle for Vision Pro has the same features as the other versions of the game, including characters and hats to unlock, game controller support, and challenge events to complete. Levels are procedurally generated, so each new game is different.<br/>
<br/>
Solitaire Stories provides players with a virtual card table to play classic solitaire games. There are multiple versions of solitaire included, such as Klondike Quick Play, Spider, and Draw 3, as well as support for online multiplayer gameplay.<br/>
<br/>
The game includes a progressive story with increasingly difficult levels, along with different deck designs to unlock. There are also daily challenges and contests.<br/>
<br/>
Crossy Road Castle and Solitaire Stories will soon be available for download <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/vision">from the Vision Pro App Store</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Several &zwnj;Apple Arcade&zwnj; games available on iOS and macOS are receiving updates today, including Puyo Puyo Puzzle Pop, Cooking Mama: Cuisine, Fruit Ninja Classic, and Zookeeper World.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-arcade/">Apple Arcade</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/24/apple-vision-pro-crossy-road-solitaire-stories/">Apple Vision Pro Gains Apple Arcade Games Crossy Road Castle and Solitaire Stories</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-vision-pro-gains-apple-arcade-games-crossy-road-castle-and-solitaire-stories.2424837/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Several months ago, Hyper introduced a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/07/hyper-debuts-hyperdrive-next-accessories/">series of accessories</a> under the "HyperDrive Next" family, bringing a variety of options for USB-C hubs and other products. I've recently spent some time testing out some of these accessories, and I've found them to offer an assortment of capabilities across price points to suit a variety of users.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/04/hyper-usb-hubs-ssd.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-945889" /><br/>
<h2>USB4 NVMe SSD Enclosure</h2><br/>
Priced at &#36;119.99, <a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=J2shFQg6J/U&mid=43456&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hypershop.com%2Fproducts%2Fhyperdrive-next-usb4-nvme-ssd-enclosure">Hyper's USB4 NVMe SSD Enclosure</a> offers support for a speedy external drive inside a robust aluminum enclosure protected by a silicone bumper to cushion against impacts and provide IP55 dust and water resistance. The enclosure supports M.2 NVMe PCIe Gen 4/3 SSDs up to 16 TB with a snap-in installation process that requires no screws. SSDs in 2230/2240/2260/2280 sizes are supported.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/04/hyper-ssd-enclosure-parts.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-945891" /><br/>
For testing, I paired Hyper's enclosure with a 2TB WD_BLACK SSD that supports up to 7,300 MB/s transfer speeds, allowing me to push the enclosure to its limits without being capped by the SSD. The installation process was as simple as advertised, and all I had to do was pop open the enclosure by hand, slide the SSD into the drive slot, secure it with a rubber secure grip, peel off the protective film on a preinstalled thermal pad, and close everything back up. An extra thermal pad and secure grips are provided in the box in case you need them.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/04/hyper-ssd-enclosure-open.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-945892" /><br/>
A 0.5-meter USB4 cable is included with the enclosure, and upon plugging the enclosure in to my MacBook Pro, I was able to quickly format it for APFS with Disk Utility to work with macOS. An illuminated Hyper logo on the enclosure shines through an opening in the silicone bumper, giving you some information about drive status. The logo shines a steady white when the enclosure is powered on and the drive is idle, and it blinks while data is being read from or written to the SSD. The logo will blink red if detects an SSD is not connected.<br/>
<br/>
Hyper says the enclosure supports up to 3,800 MB/s transfer speeds, and in my testing with a 16-inch <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m1-pro/">M1 Pro</a> MacBook Pro I saw both read and write speeds registering around 3,100 MB/s with the WD SSD. That's plenty fast for most users, allowing for fast file transfers and even the ability to work with large projects directly from the external drive. I was able to copy a ~28 GB folder with roughly 17,500 items in it to the drive in around 15 seconds.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/04/hyper-ssd-speed-test.jpg" alt="" width="1367" height="501" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-945893" /><br/>
The enclosure gets slightly warm even when not in active use, with the finned aluminum design of the enclosure and small Hyper logo-shaped holes in the silicone bumper helping move heat away from the drive. The heat was not a concern in any of my testing, as it remained comfortable to touch.<br/>
<br/>
Overall, I was pleased with the performance of the enclosure, and it's a convenient solution for backing up data or just adding extra storage. At &#36;119.99 before adding in the cost of the SSD itself, it's pricier than some other solutions, but when you consider the higher-end specs it offers, it's within the same price range as many other options from trusted brands.<br/>
<br/>
Hyper is currently sold out of the SSD enclosure on its own site, but does have it <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FHyperDrive-Enclosure-Portable-Dust-Resistant-External%2Fdp%2FB0CF2P7NL6">available through Amazon</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>10 Port USB-C Hub</h2><br/>
At the low end of Hyper's USB hub range is the <a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=J2shFQg6J/U&mid=43456&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hypershop.com%2Fproducts%2Fhyperdrivenext-10-port-usb-c-hub">10 Port USB-C Hub</a> priced at &#36;99.99. It includes support for a single external display at 4K60Hz over HDMI while offering a pair of 10 Gbps USB-C ports, two USB-A ports (one at 10 Gbps and one at 5 Gbps), SD and microSD 4.0 card slots supporting up to a theoretical maximum of 312 MB/s, Gigabit Ethernet, and a 3.5 mm combo audio jack.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/04/hyper-10-port-usb-hub-front.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="1026" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-945904" /><br/>
There's also a USB-C port with PD support at up to 140 watts, allowing for passthrough power to your computer if you hook up an external power adapter. Otherwise, the hub will run in bus-powered mode off of your computer. The hub connects to the attached computer over an integrated USB-C cable, which ensures you always have the proper cable with you but introduces a potential failure point for the whole accessory. The cable does feel fairly thick and sturdy with some strain relief reinforcement around where it enters the hub, so hopefully it will remain durable over the long term.<br/>
<br/>
This is a compact, lightweight (97 grams) hub in a very dark gray or almost midnight aluminum finish, and in my testing it's proven to be a solid option for on-the-go use cases. It slips easily into a computer bag or sleeve and offers a really nice selection of ports to help you make use of a wide variety of accessories you might run across.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/04/hyper-10-port-usb-hub-rear.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="781" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-945905" /><br/>
With support for a single external display, this may not be for true power users, but the vast majority of people are likely to only need to connect to a single display, especially in travel environments where this hub excels. A more powerful dock with additional display support and even more ports would likely suit these users better at more fixed home and office locations.<br/>
<br/>
Hyper is currently sold out of the 10 Port USB-C Hub on its own site, but it is available through <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FHyperDrive-Portable-Essentials-Connectivity-Photographers%2Fdp%2FB0CF2NP8MM">Amazon</a> and <a href="https://howl.me/cl64U6CJuFc">Best Buy</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Dual 4K HDMI 7 Port USB-C Hub</h2><br/>
Hyper's mid-range <a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=J2shFQg6J/U&mid=43456&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hypershop.com%2Fproducts%2Fhyperdrivenext-dual-4k-hdmi-7-port-usb-c-dock">Dual 4K HDMI 7 Port USB-C Hub</a> priced at &#36;149.99 offers fewer ports than the lower-end model but with enhanced display support. It includes two HDMI ports (one HDMI 2.0 at 4K60Hz and one HDMI 1.4 at 4K30Hz), a pair of 10 Gbps USB-C 3.2 Gen 2 ports, a single 10 Gbps USB-A port, a 3.5mm combo audio jack, and a USB-C port allowing you to optionally connect a PD 3.0 power adapter of up to 100 watts for passthrough charging of up to 85 watts to a connected computer. If you don't want to connect a power adapter, the hub will run in bus-powered mode from the attached computer, so no external power brick is needed.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/04/hyper-7-port-usb-hub-rear.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-946214" /><br/>
The design is an unobtrusive space gray plastic with subtle Hyper branding on the top. An integrated USB-C cable on one side connects to the host computer, while the available USB-C passthrough power port is on the opposite side. All other ports are on the rear of the hub, allowing for a relatively clean look on a desk. There are several rows of tiny Hyper logos on the ends of the hub, with the top row on each end being ventilation holes. The integrated cable is convenient for ensuring your cable is always at hand, but if it frays or otherwise breaks, the hub is rendered useless. It does appear quite durable based on my time with it though.<br/>
<br/>
Given that this is a hub rather than a wall-powered desktop dock, it's ideal to take on the go to connect to displays and other devices as needed. While dual external displays are supported over the HDMI ports, it's important to note that USB bandwidth limitations means that only one of the displays can run at 60Hz, with the other running at 30Hz. This is likely fine for less demanding productivity tasks, but definitely something to be aware of if you're hoping to drive displays with heavier demands.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/04/hyper-7-port-usb-hub-side.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-946215" /><br/>
The inclusion of two USB-C ports with 10 Gbps transfer speeds is nice for connecting external drives and other modern devices, while the USB-A port offers legacy connectivity. I prefer a couple of USB-A ports on my full-time desktop dock due to a number of accessories I use that have integrated USB-A cables or proprietary charging connectors that use USB-A at the other end, but for a portable solution, this hub does the trick just fine.<br/>
<br/>
I connected the USB4 NVMe SSD Enclosure via this hub, and it unsurprisingly impacted performance of the SSD as it was now sharing bandwidth other accessories, potentially including displays. I was still able to get write speeds of around 975 MB/s and read speeds of 850 MB/s, which should be sufficient for most users' needs.<br/>
<br/>
The Dual 4K HDMI 7 Port USB-C Hub offers a number of connectivity options primarily aimed at users on the go, but you'll need to ensure it suits your needs. It's on the pricier side of USB hubs at &#36;149.99, so make sure you need all of its capabilities and can't get away with a cheaper and simpler option. But on the flip side, the display limitations mean demanding users may want to look at other solutions such as separately connecting multiple displays to their computers for maximum performance.<br/>
<br/>
Hyper is currently listing the Dual 4K HDMI 7 Port USB-C Hub as on sale for &#36;104.99 on its own site, though it is currently out of stock. <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FHyperDrive-Portable-Essentials-Connectivity-Photographers%2Fdp%2FB0CF2RYWYD">Amazon</a> has it available for the regular price of &#36;149.99, but hopefully Hyper gets this model back in stock soon at the sale price.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>10 Port Business Class USB-C Dock</h2><br/>
For those looking for more capabilities, Hyper offers the &#36;199.99 <a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=J2shFQg6J/U&mid=43456&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hypershop.com%2Fproducts%2Fhyperdrivenext-10-port-business-class-usb-c-dock">10 Port Business Class USB-C Dock</a>. While this dock has the same dual display capabilities of one HDMI 2.0 port at 4K60Hz and one HDMI 1.4 port at 4K30Hz, it offers a different combination of other ports. As a business-focused dock, there's a heavier emphasis on legacy connectivity such as two USB-A ports, both of which run at up to 10 Gbps. The extra USB-A port is offset by the inclusion of only a single downstream USB-C port, which also runs at 10 Gbps.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/04/hyper-10-port-usb-dock-rear.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="727" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-947855" /><br/>
In addition to the same 3.5mm combo audio jack as on the 7-port hub, the 10-port model includes a Gigabit Ethernet port and an SD 4.0 card slot supporting transfer speeds up to 312 MB/s, In another nod to the business market, Kensington and Kensington Nano lock slots are included to help physically secure the dock.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/04/hyper-10-port-usb-dock-right-side.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-947856" /><br/>
The dock connects to the host computer via a short detachable USB-C to USB-C cable, which conveniently snaps into the edge of the dock for travel, so this is a great balance of convenience and repairability. While the dock can be bus powered over this connection, you can also provide external power to the dock that can pass through to your laptop. The dock allows for power input via either USB-C or a DC barrel connector, but an external power adapter is not provided with the dock.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/04/hyper-10-port-usb-dock-front.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="689" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-947857" /><br/>
I experienced no issues in my testing, with the dock reliably driving two displays, keeping in mind that the 30Hz refresh rate on the second display may be insufficient for some uses. Productivity users are, however, unlikely to notice any issues due to that limitation. Ethernet and USB connectivity worked as advertised.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/04/hyper-10-port-usb-dock-left-side.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-947858" /><br/>
SD card reader speeds also appeared as advertised, with my test card nearing its maximum specs at write speeds of 125 MB/s and read speeds of around 220 MB/s.<br/>
<br/>
While the 10 Port Business Class USB-C Dock is priced at &#36;199.99 at Hyper, <a href="https://howl.me/cl645uk8NFU">Best Buy is currently offering it</a> for a discounted price of &#36;159.99.<br/>
<br/>
<h3>Wrap-up</h3><br/>
Overall, Hyper offers a nice selection of USB-C hubs and docks to suit a variety of needs. While they don't have quite the capabilities of a Thunderbolt dock, they can provide good options for port expandability both on the go and in a desktop situation.<br/>
<br/>
The USB4 SSD Enclosure supports the latest USB standard for high read and write speeds that should satisfy almost all users, and it comes in a compact package ideal for extra portable storage. Just make sure the SSD you're using can take advantage of the speeds the enclosure has to offer.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today seeded the third beta of an upcoming <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sonoma/">macOS Sonoma</a> 14.5 update to public beta testers, allowing non-developers to test the software ahead of its launch. The public beta comes a week after Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/17/apple-releases-second-public-beta-of-ios-17-5/">released the second public beta</a> and a day after Apple seeded the beta to developers. <br/>

Beta testers can opt-in through the Software Update section of the System Settings app. Under Beta updates, simply toggle on the Sonoma Public Beta. Note that you must sign up to participate on Apple's <a href="https://beta.apple.com">beta testing website</a>.<br/>
<br/>
There have been no new features found in the &zwnj;macOS Sonoma&zwnj; 14.5 developer betas so far, and Apple listed no additions in its release notes. It is likely that the update focuses on bug fixes and other small under-the-hood improvements. <div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sonoma/">macOS Sonoma</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macos-sonoma.243">macOS Sonoma</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/24/apple-seeds-third-public-beta-of-macos-14-5/">Apple Seeds Third Public Beta of macOS 14.5</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-seeds-third-public-beta-of-macos-14-5.2424831/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today seeded the third betas of upcoming iOS 17.5 and iPadOS 17.5 updates to public beta testers, allowing non-developers to test the software ahead of its release. The second public iOS 17.5 and iPadOS 17.5 betas come a week after Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/17/apple-releases-second-public-beta-of-ios-17-5/">released the second betas</a> for public beta testers, and a day after the software was made available to developers. <br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-943813" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/iOS-17.5-Feature-Orange.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" /><br/>
Public beta testers can get the beta by opening up the Settings app, going to the Software Update section, tapping on the "Beta Updates" option, and toggling on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a> or <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-17/">iPadOS 17</a> Public Beta. Signing up on Apple's beta testing website is required.<br/>
<br/>
iOS 17.5 is limited on new outward-facing features, focusing primarily on changes in the European Union. App developers in the EU are now able to add their <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> apps to their website, so that users can download them directly without having to use the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a>.<br/>
<br/>
To offer an app for download from a website in the European Union, developers need to meet specific criteria. Developers need to be a member of the Apple Developer Program for two continuous years or more and must have an app with more than one million first installs on iOS in the European Union in the prior year. Other requirements include submitting to Apple's notarization process and publishing transparent data collection policies.<br/>
<br/>
This feature is limited to the European Union due to the Digital Markets Act and is not available to all users.<br/>
<br/>
iOS 17.5 and iPadOS 17.5 <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/03/everything-new-in-ios-17-5-beta-1/">also have updates</a> to mobile device management and there are code changes suggesting Battery Health functionality could come to the new iPads and that Apple will soon add alerts for third-party item trackers.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-17/">iPadOS 17</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-17.241">iOS 17</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-17.242">iPadOS 17</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/24/apple-releases-third-public-beta-of-ios-17-5/">Apple Releases Third Public Beta of iOS 17.5</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-releases-third-public-beta-of-ios-17-5.2424830/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today began selling certified refurbished Apple Watch Series 9 models in the U.S. for the first time since the device was released in September.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/Apple-Watch-Series-9.jpg" alt="" width="2880" height="1620" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-910331" /><br/>
The refurbished Series 9 models are discounted by approximately 15% compared to the equivalent brand new models, with pricing starting at &#36;339, down from &#36;399. A <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/FR903LW/A/Refurbished-Apple-Watch-Series-9-GPS-41mm-Silver-Aluminum-Case-with-S-M-Storm-Blue-Sport-Band">variety</a> <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/FRJ83LW/A/Refurbished-Apple-Watch-Series-9-GPS-Cellular-41mm-Graphite-Stainless-Steel-Case-with-S-M-Midnight-Sport-Band">of</a> <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/FRHN3LW/A/Refurbished-Apple-Watch-Series-9-GPS-Cellular-41mm-Starlight-Aluminum-Case-with-S-M-Starlight-Sport-Band">configurations</a> are available as of writing.<br/>
<br/>
Apple says it puts all of its refurbished products through a thorough cleaning process and inspection, and performs full functionality testing. In general, refurbished products sold directly by Apple have a very good reputation.<br/>
<br/>
Like new Series 9 models sold directly by Apple in the U.S. currently, we expect that the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/18/apple-website-apple-watch-blood-oxygen-removal/">Blood Oxygen app is deactivated</a> on the refurbished models, due to a legal battle with medical technology company Masimo. Last year, the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/10/itc-opposes-apple-watch-sales-ban-pause/">banned Apple</a> from importing and selling Apple Watch models with blood oxygen sensing after it ruled that the feature infringed on Masimo's patents. Apple is appealing the decision, and could <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/12/apple-watch-blood-oxygen-sensor-software/">re-enable the Blood Oxygen app with a watchOS update</a> if it is overturned.<br/>
<br/>
As a reminder, Apple began selling <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/19/refurbished-apple-watch-ultra-2-in-us/">refurbished Apple Watch Ultra 2 models</a> in the U.S. and select other countries last week.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch/">Apple Watch Series 9</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-refurbished/">Apple Refurbished Products</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch">Apple Watch (Neutral)</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/24/refurbished-apple-watch-series-9/">Apple Watch Series 9 Now Available on Apple&#039;s Refurbished Store in U.S.</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-watch-series-9-now-available-on-apples-refurbished-store-in-u-s.2424826/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<title>Next Apple Watch Said to Use Material Allowing for Thinner Logic Board</title>

		<description><![CDATA[At least one next-generation Apple Watch model will start using resin-coated copper, according to supply chain sources cited by <a href="https://www.digitimes.com/news/a20240422PD225/nanya-pcb-apple-supply-chain-ic-substrate.html">Taiwanese website <em>DigiTimes</em></a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/08/s9-chip-apple-watch.jpg" alt="" width="1501" height="844" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-913379" /><br/>
As the name implies, resin-coated copper is a thin layer of copper foil coated with a resin, such as an epoxy. While adoption of this material would offer many benefits for a future Apple Watch's logic board, such as improved durability and water resistance, a key advantage is that it would <a href="https://na.industrial.panasonic.com/products/electronic-materials/lineup/circuit-board-materials/series/133871">allow for a thinner logic board</a>, which in turn would provide additional internal space for other components and sensors in the Apple Watch.<br/>
<br/>
Any extra space that can be freed up in the Apple Watch is extremely valuable, as Apple continues to add health features to the device. The next Apple Watch models due later this year are <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/17/apple-watch-2024-health-features/">rumored to feature blood pressure sensing</a>, for example, and Apple is reportedly <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/26/apple-watch-blood-glucose-up-to-seven-years-away/">working on non-invasive blood glucose monitoring</a> as a long-term project.<br/>
<br/>
There is still uncertainty surrounding the next Apple Watch lineup, as it is unclear if the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-watch-x/">redesigned "Apple Watch X"</a> will be launching this year or next year. In addition, it was rumored that there <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/26/kuo-apple-watch-ultra-3-in-2024-odds-decreasing/">might not be an Apple Watch Ultra 3 this year</a>. A new Apple Watch SE is likely this year if Apple sticks to a two-year refresh cycle for that model.<br/>
<br/>
Apple supply chain analyst Ming-Chi Kuo last year said <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/12/rcc-thinner-circuit-boards-2025/">iPhone 17 Pro models also might adopt resin-coated copper</a> for the logic board next year, so this is a change that might extend to multiple devices in Apple's lineup over the next few years.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch/">Apple Watch Series 9</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/digitimes-com/">DigiTimes</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch">Apple Watch (Neutral)</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/24/next-apple-watch-thinner-logic-board-rumor/">Next Apple Watch Said to Use Material Allowing for Thinner Logic Board</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/next-apple-watch-said-to-use-material-allowing-for-thinner-logic-board.2424824/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's upcoming 12.9-inch <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/">iPad Air</a> will feature an LCD display like its smaller sibling, according to <a href="https://www.displaysupplychain.com/">Display Supply Chain Consultants</a> CEO and analyst Ross Young.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/iPad-Air-12.9-Inch-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2192" height="1233" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-917813" /><br/>
<br/>
Earlier this month, Young said that the larger &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/18/12-9-inch-ipad-air-mini-led-display-rumor/">would feature a mini-LED display</a> like the current <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a> of the same size. The existing 10.9-inch &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; is equipped with a standard LCD panel, and the move to mini-LED technology for the 12.9-inch model would have provided increased brightness for HDR content, deeper blacks, lower power consumption, and more. He said the 12.9-inch &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; would use leftover mini-LED display panels from the 12.9-inch &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj;, with the 10.9-inch model sticking with LCDs.<br/>
<br/>
Now, in a <a href="https://x.com/dsccross/status/1783153530678944154?s=46&t=7hGG_t1VNNuDJze42Vj_-w">post to subscribers</a> on X (formerly Twitter), he said that this is no longer expected to be the case due to the panel's high cost, despite confirmation from multiple supply chain sources. As a result, both &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; models will feature LCD displays, clearly delineating them from the &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj;, which is expected to move to OLED.<br/>
<br/>
However, Young added that there may be a new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> model with a 12.9-inch mini-LED display introduced in the fourth quarter of 2024. Speculatively, the device could be a high-end &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj;, a low-end &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj;, or something else entirely. Next-generation &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; models are expected to be announced at <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/23/apple-event-let-loose-may-7/">Apple's "Let loose" event</a> on May 7.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/">iPad Air </a></div><div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mini-led/">Mini-LED</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/2024-ipad-air/">2024 iPad Air</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPad-Air">iPad Air (Don't Buy)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipad.137">iPad</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/24/12-9-inch-ipad-air-will-not-feature-mini-led/">12.9-Inch iPad Air No Longer Expected to Feature Mini-LED Display</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/12-9-inch-ipad-air-no-longer-expected-to-feature-mini-led-display.2424821/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/08/tiktok-logo.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-752609" /><br/>
The landmark bill has now passed both chambers of Congress, having already been approved by the House of Representatives. President Biden says he will sign the bill into law on Wednesday.<br/>
<br/>
Once that happens, TikTok will be banned in the United States if ByteDance does not divest ownership within nine months, with a possible three-month extension to that deadline if a deal is in progress.  China would need to approve any sale, but the Chinese government has already made it clear that it will "<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/23/technology/tiktok-congress-hearing.html">firmly oppose</a>" such a move.<br/>
<br/>
ByteDance is also expected to launch a legal challenge against the bill by arguing that it will deprive the app's 170 million U.S. users of their First Amendment rights protecting freedom of speech.<br/>
<br/>
U.S. lawmakers want TikTok to be sold to a company outside of China over concerns that the Chinese government could force ByteDance to hand over data from users located in the United States. If Beijing made the request, ByteDance would not be able to refuse. There have also been suggestions that Chinese authorities could use TikTok to spread political propaganda.<br/>
<br/>
ByteDance has attempted to alleviate these fears by storing data from U.S. users on servers owned by Oracle, but the White House and lawmakers do not believe that is enough. There are a limited number of companies that would be able to afford TikTok, while most tech giants would likely be prevented from acquiring it due to antitrust concerns.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tiktok/">TikTok</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/24/tiktok-facing-us-ban-congress-passes-bill/">TikTok Facing Potential US Ban as Congress Passes Bill Requiring Sale</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/tiktok-facing-potential-us-ban-as-congress-passes-bill-requiring-sale.2424807/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The European Commission has waved through <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_24_608">new 'right to repair' legislation</a> that aims to make it easier for consumers to get their broken devices fixed, even if products are out of warranty.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2016/01/European-Commisssion.jpg" alt="" width="1080" height="719" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-484620" /><br/>
The EU already requires companies to offer a two-year minimum warranty on common household appliances and electronics, such as smartphones, TVs, washing machines, and vacuum cleaners, but the new rules impose additional requirements.<br/>
<br/>
According to the legislation, if a consumer chooses to have their device repaired under warranty, the warranty must be extended by a year. Consumers may also borrow a device while theirs is being repaired, and if it cannot be fixed, they have the right to opt for a refurbished unit as an alternative.<br/>
<br/>
When a product's warranty expires, companies are still required to repair devices at a "reasonable price," so as not to intentionally discourage consumers from repairing them. Manufacturers will also be prohibited from using "hardware or software related barriers to repair," including preventing the use of second-hand, compatible, and 3D-printed spare parts by independent repairers as long as they conform to EU laws. <br/>
<br/>
Additionally, manufacturers will be unable to refuse to repair a product solely for economic reasons or because it was previously repaired by someone else. Companies will be required to publish information about their repair services, including indicative prices of the most common repairs.<br/>
<blockquote>"Consumers' right to repair products will now become a reality," said <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/press-room/20240419IPR20590/right-to-repair-making-repair-easier-and-more-appealing-to-consumers">European Parliament rapporteur René Repasi</a>. "It will be easier and cheaper to repair instead of purchase new, expensive items. This is a significant achievement for Parliament and its commitment to empower consumers in the fight against climate change. The new legislation extends legal guarantees by 12 months when opting for repair, gives better access to spare parts and ensures easier, cheaper and faster repair."</blockquote>The legislation will come into effect after formal approval by the Council, with the directive set to activate 20 days after its publication. <br/>
<br/>
Europe's <a href="https://repair.eu/news/analysis-of-the-adopted-directive-on-common-rules-promoting-the-repair-of-goods/">Right to Repair group</a> welcomed the legislation, calling it "a step in the right direction," but said "the scope of products covered remains very narrow," and would introduce loopholes. The coalition noted that the rules only cover consumer products, and not anything purchased by businesses or industrial goods. It also criticized the lack of guidance on what constituted a "reasonable price" for spare parts. <br/>
<br/>
Apple is likely to be impacted by the legislation, especially with regard to its controversial <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/11/apple-responds-to-parts-pairing-criticism/">"parts pairing" requirement</a> that prevents third-party replacements of certain device components. Currently, if an iPhone part is replaced with a like-for-like replacement by an unofficial third party, it may not be recognised by the iPhone's system software. The wording of the new EU rules suggests this will no longer be allowed.<br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile in the U.S., more than two-dozen states are working on individual right-to-repair legislation. <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/11/california-right-to-repair-law/">California's Right to Repair Act</a> will become law this July, requiring manufacturers to make repair materials available for all electronics and appliances that cost &#36;50 or more.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/european-union/">European Union</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/european-commission/">European Commission</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/right-to-repair/">Right to Repair</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/24/new-eu-right-to-repair-law-devices/">EU Right to Repair Rules Force Companies to Fix Out-of-Warranty Devices</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/eu-right-to-repair-rules-force-companies-to-fix-out-of-warranty-devices.2424805/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple is planning to refresh the entire Mac lineup with updated M4 chips starting in late 2024 and continuing into 2025, and that will include a new M4 chip for Apple's mid-tier desktop machine, the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-studio/">Mac Studio</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/04/M4-Mac-Studio-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2672" height="1503" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-946114" /><br/>
<h2 id="m4_chip_rumors">M4 Chip Rumors</h2><br/>
Apple has a lineup of M4 chips in development, including the standard M4, the M4 Pro and M4 Max, and a higher-end version that's codenamed "Hidra." This higher-end chip could be an "Ultra" version that's equivalent to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m2/">M2</a> Ultra, or it might even be something even more powerful.<br/>
<br/>
With the &zwnj;M2&zwnj; lineup, the &zwnj;M2&zwnj; Ultra is a chip that is in fact two &zwnj;M2&zwnj; Max chips linked together. There is no M3 Ultra at this time, but the architecture of the M3 Max chip <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/28/m3-max-chip-hidden-change/">has led to speculation</a> that future Ultra chips might be standalone chips rather than constructed from two Max dies.<br/>
<br/>
The M3 Max seems to lack the UltraFusion interconnect that allowed the &zwnj;M2&zwnj; Max chips to function as an Ultra. Because that's missing, it's likely the Ultra chip would have dedicated development with customizations for heavy workloads. Apple could tweak the number of performance and efficiency cores to focus on power, and add more GPU cores.<br/>
<br/>
Current &zwnj;Mac Studio&zwnj; machines use &zwnj;M2&zwnj; Max and &zwnj;M2&zwnj; Ultra chips, so we can expect the M4 models to be equipped with M4 Max and M4 Ultra (or its equivalent) chips. Aside from the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-pro/">Mac Pro</a>, the &zwnj;Mac Studio&zwnj; is the only Apple machine that uses "Ultra" chips.<br/>
<br/>
The &zwnj;Mac Studio&zwnj; is designed for Mac users who have system intensive workflows that require advanced compute and graphics capabilities. There isn't a lot of differentiation between the &zwnj;Mac Studio&zwnj; and &zwnj;Mac Pro&zwnj; as of right now, so Apple may be planning for a more powerful M4 Ultra variant for the &zwnj;Mac Pro&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
Apple is going all-in on artificial intelligence across its product lineup in the coming months, so the M4 is expected to have a focus on boosting AI and machine learning performance. Rumors suggest there will be an updated Neural Engine with a greater number of cores to handle AI tasks.<br/>
<br/>
<h3 id="memory_updates">Memory Updates</h3><br/>
The next &zwnj;Mac Studio&zwnj; and &zwnj;Mac Pro&zwnj; could support as much as 500GB of Unified Memory, up from the current 192GB maximum.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="what_about_the_m3">What About the M3?</h2><br/>
With Apple planning to refresh the &zwnj;Mac Studio&zwnj; with M4 chips in 2025, it's not entirely clear as of yet if there will be an M3 refresh this year.<br/>
<br/>
The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/">iMac</a>, MacBook Pro, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/">MacBook Air</a> lines have been updated with M3 chips, but the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-mini/">Mac mini</a>, &zwnj;Mac Studio&zwnj;, and &zwnj;Mac Pro&zwnj; are still using &zwnj;M2&zwnj; chips. With the M4 refresh already planned, Apple could skip the M3 update for its desktop machines, but it's also possible we'll get an M3 refresh around the middle of the year and a second M4 refresh next year, which would put a year between each update.<br/>
<br/>
Apple is testing a version of the &zwnj;Mac Studio&zwnj; with an M3 processor, so an update this year and then a second update next year is plausible.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="design_changes">Design Changes</h2><br/>
The &zwnj;Mac Studio&zwnj; hasn't had a design update since it was first launched in March 2022, but it hasn't really existed long enough to need a refresh. Apple tends to wait several years before making major changes to Mac hardware, and we are not expecting the &zwnj;Mac Studio&zwnj; to get a refreshed look in the near future.<br/>
<br/>
It will likely be closer to 2026 or 2027 before Apple considers updating the design, though it could be even longer. The &zwnj;Mac mini&zwnj; has not seen notable design changes since 2010.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="release_date">Release Date</h2><br/>
According <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/14/when-are-m4-macs-launching/">to <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman</a>, the &zwnj;Mac Studio&zwnj; with M4 chip is expected to be released in mid-2025, which would suggest a possible introduction at the 2025 Worldwide Developers Conference.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-studio/">Mac Studio</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Mac-Studio">Mac Studio (Caution)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/mac-studio.237">Mac Studio</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m4-mac-studio/">Apple&#039;s M4 Mac Studio: What We Know So Far</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apples-m4-mac-studio-what-we-know-so-far.2424785/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>
