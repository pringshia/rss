		<description><![CDATA[Apple's "It's Glowtime" media event kicks off at 10:00 am Pacific Time today with members of the media in attendance for what is expected to be another pre-recorded presentation. We know that some <em>MacRumors</em> readers who can't follow the event as it's being broadcast are interested in avoiding all of the announcements and waiting until the event video is available for on-demand viewing so as to experience it without already knowing the outcome. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/08/apple-iphone-16-event-glowtime-logo.jpg" alt="" width="2048" height="1152" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-962408" /><br/>
For those individuals, we've posted this news story, which will be updated with a direct link to the presentation once it becomes available from Apple. No other news stories or announcements will be displayed alongside this story.<br/>
<br/>
Apple's recent virtual events have been made available to view almost immediately following the conclusion of the broadcasts, and we expect similar timing for today's event.<br/>
<br/>
Users waiting for the video to be posted are welcome to gather in the thread associated with this news story, and we ask that those who follow the events as they occur refrain from making any posts about Apple's announcements in this thread.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/09/september-2024-spoiler-free/">September 2024 Apple Event Spoiler-Free Video Stream</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/september-2024-apple-event-spoiler-free-video-stream.2435449/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<title>iPhone 16 Pro Now Expected to Start at &#36;999 in U.S. Despite Recent &#36;1,099 Rumor</title>

		<description><![CDATA[<em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman believes the iPhone 16 Pro will start at &#36;999 in the U.S., meaning there would be no starting price increase over the iPhone 15 Pro.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/iPhone-16-Side-2-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="3532" height="1986" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-913688" /><br/>
"I don't expect the Pro entry price to be raised from &#36;999," <a href="https://x.com/markgurman/status/1832945268607844448">said</a> Gurman.<br/>
<br/>
This prediction runs counter to a report last week from Taiwanese research firm TrendForce that claimed the iPhone 16 Pro would <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/06/both-iphone-16-pro-models-256gb-base-storage/">start at &#36;1,099 in the U.S. with 256GB of storage</a>. This meant the iPhone 16 Pro would not have been available with 128GB of storage for &#36;999 like the iPhone 15 Pro is, but Gurman believing that the &#36;999 price point will stick around suggests that a 128GB configuration will remain available after all.<br/>
<br/>
Apple has offered at least one Pro model or equivalent tier of the iPhone at a starting price of &#36;999 in the U.S. since the iPhone X was released in 2017.<br/>
<br/>
&#36;999 or &#36;1,099? We'll find out for sure in just a few hours. Apple's event kicks off at 10 a.m. Pacific Time, and we'll have live coverage of the announcements.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/">iPhone 16 Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/09/iphone-16-pro-999-rumor/">iPhone 16 Pro Now Expected to Start at &#36;999 in U.S. Despite Recent &#36;1,099 Rumor</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-16-pro-now-expected-to-start-at-999-in-u-s-despite-recent-1-099-rumor.2435434/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Architecture and design publication <a href="https://www.dezeen.com/2024/09/09/the-observatory-apple-park-california/"><em>Dezeen</em> today shared photos</a> of an all-new event-focused building at Apple Park called "The Observatory."<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/Apple-Park-The-Observatory-Outside.jpg" alt="" width="1704" height="958" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-964430" /><br/>
"The Observatory" is built into a hillside near Steve Jobs Theater, and it will be used for new product demonstrations following Apple's special events, according to the report. It is set to open following the iPhone 16 event today.<br/>
<br/>
The building has a domed entrance above the ground with a sky-facing oculus, along with a "portal-like" window with views of the Apple Park campus.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/Apple-Park-The-Observatory-Inside-Large.jpeg" alt="" width="1280" height="853" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-964431" /><br/>
"With its stunning views of the campus greenery and the mountains ringing the horizon, The Observatory truly is an extension of Apple Park, showcasing the best of California and the best of the natural environment around us," said John De Maio, Apple's global head of design for real estate and development.<br/>
<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple may be planning to introduce a redesigned version of the popular Milanese Loop Apple Watch band at the "It's Glowtime" event later today.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/new-rumored-Milanese-Loop.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-964402" /><br/>
Images of what purport to be replicas of an official redesigned version of the Milanese Loop have begun <a href="https://m.blog.naver.com/PostView.naver?blogId=yeux1122&logNo=223575536903&navType=by">circulating</a> on Asian social media platforms over the past week. The alleged new version of the band features a clasp instead of a magnet and seems to come in a 49mm size designed for the Apple Watch Ultra. The current Milanese Loop is only available in 41mm and 45mm sizes. A clasp like this would be a more secure solution for the Milanese Loop without compromising adjustability since the magnet used on the current version is liable to slipping, which loosens the band.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="fr" dir="ltr">Possible colors available <a href="https://t.co/73wU0Rcf2i">pic.twitter.com/73wU0Rcf2i</a></p>&mdash; Majin Bu (@MajinBuOfficial) <a href="https://twitter.com/MajinBuOfficial/status/1832127332506857586?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 6, 2024</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div><br/>
<br/>
The Milanese Loop Apple Watch band was introduced alongside the original Apple Watch in 2014 as part of Apple's premium range of bands. Inspired by traditional 19th-century Milanese watch bands, it features a unique mesh design made from woven stainless steel to offer both flexibility and durability. Initially available in Silver and later in Space Black, the Milanese Loop has remained a staple of Apple's watch band lineup across all Apple Watch generations.<br/>
<br/>
Apple is expected to introduce the third-generation <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch-se/">Apple Watch SE</a>, the Apple Watch Series 10, and a new dark color option for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch-ultra/">Apple Watch Ultra 2</a> at the "It's Glowtime" event later today, so the introduction of new bands is likely. Weibo leaker known as "Instant Digital" today <a href="https://weibo.com/u/5143897135">claimed</a> that despite some rumors suggesting that the Apple Watch's band system could change this year, it will remain the same with compatibility carried forward.<br/>
<br/>
MacRumors will have in-depth coverage of the Apple event, which kicks off at 10:00 a.m. Pacific Time, including a live blog on our website and posts via <a href="https://twitter.com/macrumorslive">@MacRumorsLive on X</a>.

		<description><![CDATA[12 years after Apple's EarPods were introduced with the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> 5, the company may finally discontinue its &#36;19 wired earbuds.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/8-Old-EarPods-With-3.5mm-Plugs.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-928624" /><br/>
According to <em>MacRumors</em> contributor <a href="https://x.com/aaronp613/status/1832974559231754636?s=46">Aaron Perris</a>, major U.S. retailer Target has listed all three EarPods variants (Lightning, 3.5mm, and USB-C) as "Non-Carry Forward," suggesting that they are soon to be discontinued. While it is unclear when this could occur, the timing of the news coinciding with Apple's "It's Glowtime" <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a> Apple event later today suggests that the move could be imminent.<br/>
<br/>
Apple's EarPods were first introduced in 2012 as the standard earphones bundled with iPhones and iPods, replacing the earlier circular earbuds. Initially, the EarPods were equipped with a standard 3.5mm headphone jack, but with the launch of the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 7 and the introduction of AirPods in 2016, Apple started removing the headphone jack from its devices. A new version of the EarPods were released simultaneously with a Lightning connector to match the new &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;'s only remaining port. Last year, with the switch to USB-C on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a> lineup, Apple introduced a third revision of the EarPods with a USB-C connector. <br/>
<br/>
EarPods have seen a resurgence in popularity in recent years owing to their excellent microphone and low price point, so their discontinuation would likely disappoint many fans of the inexpensive earbuds.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/earpods/">EarPods</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/09/apple-may-discontinue-earpods/">After 12 Years, Apple May Finally Discontinue EarPods</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/after-12-years-apple-may-finally-discontinue-earpods.2435425/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's online storefront has gone down ahead of the "It's Glowtime" Apple event taking place later today, where several new products are expected to be announced.<br/>
<br/>

Apple is expected to announce the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/">iPhone 16 Pro</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch-se/">Apple Watch SE</a> 3, Apple Watch Series 10, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airpods-4/">AirPods 4</a>, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-max/">AirPods Max</a> 2. The company should also announce the release dates of its next major software updates including <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sequoia/">macOS Sequoia</a>. The event's tagline, "It's Glowtime," seems to hint at Apple Intelligence's role in the event.<br/>
<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Last week, we <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/review/ultimate-ears-everboom-speaker/">took a look at the EVERBOOM</a>, a recent mid-range addition to the portable speaker lineup from Logitech's Ultimate Ears brand, and today Ultimate Ears is introducing a <a href="https://ultimate-ears.dubn.net/y2z71V">new smallest and cheapest member of the family, the MINIROLL</a>. Notably, it's a revival of the previous ROLL and ROLL 2 form factor that was discontinued back in 2019, but slightly smaller and with upgraded specs.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/ue-miniroll-cooler.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-964229" /><br/>
Priced at &#36;79.99, the MINIROLL is a compact round speaker optimized for portability. It has a hard plastic rear shell and a firm polyester mesh front, and it features the traditional oversized plus and minus volume buttons that are found on the front of most Ultimate Ears speakers. A rubber-like strap spans the entire rear of speaker, with a tab that allows the top of it to be unhooked so the speaker can be attached to backpack straps, belts, leashes, cooler handles, and even small rods like tent supports.<br/>
<br/>
The MINIROLL measures a little over 4 inches (105 mm) in diameter with the strap tab adding a bit in the vertical dimension, and it's around 1.9 inches (48 mm) thick, while it weighs 9.8 ounces (279 g). With an IP67 rating, the MINIROLL is highly resistant to water and dust, and it's been drop tested to a height of 1.2 meters, so it's ready for an active lifestyle out and about in the wilderness, at the pool, and elsewhere.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/ue-miniroll-box-front.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-964230" /><br/>
In addition to the prominent volume buttons, the MINIROLL includes subtle power/pairing and play/pause buttons on the left side. A short press of the power button turns the speaker on or off, while a longer press activates the Bluetooth pairing mode. The audio control button offers the typical functionality of a single press for play/pause, a double press for skipping forward, and a triple press for skipping backward. Pressing the volume buttons simultaneously will trigger the MINIROLL to speak its approximate battery level. <br/>
<br/>
For charging, there's a USB-C port on the bottom of the MINIROLL, and battery life is rated at 12 hours. The speaker can be recharged in under 3 hours, but you'll have to provide your own cable.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/ue-miniroll-hand.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-964231" /><br/>
With its small size, there's not a ton of space inside the MINIROLL, but it still features a 45.6 mm active driver and a 37.75 x 65 mm passive radiator, and it delivers directional sound at up to 85.5 dB. This isn't going to be offering large room-filling sound, but it puts out plenty of volume for personal and small-group settings.<br/>
<br/>
If you need more sound, you can sync an unlimited number of MINIROLL speakers in PartyUp mode with Auracast technology, taking advantage of Bluetooth range of up to 40 meters (131 feet). A long press on the play/pause button activates PartyUp on the primary MINIROLL, broadcasting its connection and allowing other MINIROLL speakers to join with the same long press.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/ue-miniroll-rear.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-964232" /><br/>
The MINIROLL is <a href="https://ultimate-ears.dubn.net/y2z71V">available to order today</a> from Ultimate Ears and comes in four color options: Gentle Black, Majestic Blue, Revive Grey, and Calming Pink.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[<em>Bloomberg</em>'s <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a> is sharing some last-minute predictions tonight regarding what we can expect to see at tomorrow's "It's Glowtime" Apple event, and in addition to his claim that the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch-ultra/">Apple Watch Ultra 2</a> only appears to be getting a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/08/gurman-no-apple-watch-ultra-3-tomorrow/">new black color option</a> with no third-generation model being introduced, he believes we <a href="https://twitter.com/markgurman/status/1832964963700511056">will be seeing updated AirPods Max headphones</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/12/AirPods-Max-Gen-2-Feature-Red.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-877605" /><br/>
In line with his previous reporting about the new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-max/">AirPods Max</a>, Gurman says the updated models will include improved audio performance in the form of better active noise cancellation and new adaptive audio features, while the headphones will switch from Lightning to USB-C.<br/>
<br/>
Gurman previously suggested that the new &zwnj;AirPods Max&zwnj; <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/06/new-airpods-max-and-apple-tv-unlikely/">might not arrive at tomorrow's event</a>, citing a lack of product shortages for the current models at Apple, but it now appears we may see an introduction after all.<br/>
<br/>
Previous reports have suggested the updated &zwnj;AirPods Max&zwnj; may also include some new color options, but no broader updates to the overall design are expected.<br/>
<br/>
In addition to the &zwnj;AirPods Max&zwnj;, we're also expecting a more significant update for the standard AirPods tomorrow with two new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airpods-4/">AirPods 4</a> models rumored, including one with active noise cancellation.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-max/">AirPods Max</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AirPods-Max">AirPods Max (Caution)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/airpods.216">AirPods</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/08/airpods-max-usb-c-glowtime-apple-event/">New AirPods Max With Improved Audio and USB-C Expected Tomorrow</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/new-airpods-max-with-improved-audio-and-usb-c-expected-tomorrow.2435400/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

Instead, he believes that Apple will introduce a black titanium color option for the Apple Watch Ultra 2.<br/>

Nearly a year ago, Apple supply chain analyst Ming-Chi Kuo was first to indicate there <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/26/kuo-apple-watch-ultra-3-in-2024-odds-decreasing/">might not be an Apple Watch Ultra 3</a> this year. At the time, Kuo said the potential lack of an Apple Watch Ultra 3 this year could be partly due to Apple needing "more time to develop innovative health management features." <br/>
<br/>
A black titanium casing option for the Apple Watch Ultra 2 was <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/01/apple-watch-ultra-2-black-titanium-rumor/">originally rumored to launch last year</a>, but that never happened.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch-ultra/">Apple Watch Ultra 2</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch_Ultra">Apple Watch Ultra (Don't Buy)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-watch.172">Apple Watch</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/08/gurman-no-apple-watch-ultra-3-tomorrow/">Gurman: No Apple Watch Ultra 3 Tomorrow, Ultra 2 in Black Likely</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/gurman-no-apple-watch-ultra-3-tomorrow-ultra-2-in-black-likely.2435398/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/Apple-Intelligence-General-Feature-2.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-963424" /><br/>
In his <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-09-08/apple-event-staggered-ai-rollout-and-same-iphone-design-means-no-super-cycle-m0tkgzqg"><em>Power On</em> newsletter</a>, Gurman said that Apple now plans to make the <strong>Image Playground</strong> feature for generating images and the <strong>Genmoji</strong> feature for generating custom emoji available in iOS 18.2, which will likely be released in December.<br/>
<br/>
Here is how Apple describes Image Playground:<blockquote>Produce fun, original images in seconds with the Image Playground experience right in your apps. Create an entirely new image based on a description, suggested concepts, and even a person from your Photos library. You can easily adjust the style and make changes to match a Messages thread, your Freeform board, or a slide in Keynote.</blockquote><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/08/ios-18-genmoji.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-960703" /><br/>
Here is how Apple describes Genmoji:<blockquote>Make a brand-new Genmoji right in the keyboard to match any conversation. Provide a description to see a preview, and adjust your description until it's perfect. You can even pick someone from your Photos library and create a Genmoji that looks like them.</blockquote>The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/29/ios-18-1-apple-intelligence-features/">first Apple Intelligence features</a> will be available starting with iOS 18.1, which is likely to be released to the public in October. These features include new writing tools for generating and summarizing text, notification summaries, suggested replies in the Messages app, the ability to record and transcribe phone calls, a new "Clean Up" tool in the Photos app that can quickly remove objects from a photo, and a few others.<br/>
<br/>
Apple Intelligence will require an iPhone 15 Pro or iPhone 15 Pro Max running iOS 18.1 or later. The features will initially be available with device language set to English only. Apple said more languages will follow over the next year.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-18/">iPadOS 18</a></div><div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/">Apple Intelligence</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-18.244">iOS 18</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-18.245">iPadOS 18</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/08/ios-18-2-apple-intelligence-features/">These Two Apple Intelligence Features Not Expected Until iOS 18.2</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/these-two-apple-intelligence-features-not-expected-until-ios-18-2.2435362/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sequoia/">macOS Sequoia</a> will be one of the earliest new macOS launches in over a decade, likely releasing within as little as just a week. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/sequoia.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-954485" /><br/>
Internal Apple documentation obtained by <em>MacRumors</em> suggests that macOS 15.0 Sequoia will be officially released to the public by mid-September. The release dates of major macOS updates in recent years are listed below:<br/>
<br/>
<ul><br/>
  <li>OS X 10.9 (Mavericks) – October 22, 2013</li><br/>
  <li>OS X 10.10 (Yosemite) – October 16, 2014</li><br/>
  <li>OS X 10.11 (El Capitan) – September 30, 2015</li><br/>
  <li>macOS 10.12 (Sierra) – September 20, 2016</li><br/>
  <li>macOS 10.13 (High Sierra) – September 25, 2017</li><br/>
  <li>macOS 10.14 (Mojave) – September 24, 2018</li><br/>
  <li>macOS 10.15 (Catalina) – October 7, 2019</li><br/>
  <li>macOS 11.0 (Big Sur) – November 12, 2020</li><br/>
  <li>macOS 12.0 (Monterey) – October 25, 2021</li><br/>
  <li>macOS 13.0 (Ventura) – October 24, 2022</li><br/>
  <li>macOS 14.0 (Sonoma) – September 26, 2023</li><br/>
</ul><br/>
<br/>
The release of &zwnj;macOS Sequoia&zwnj; by mid-September this year would be the earliest since OS X 10.8 (Mountain Lion), which was released on July 25, 2012.<br/>
<br/>
The new annual version of iOS has historically always been released at least a week before the new version of macOS. Sometimes, Apple leaves a considerable gap between the releases; in 2020, the company left nearly two months between the release of iOS 14 (September 16, 2020) and macOS Big Sur (November 12, 2020).<br/>
<br/>
New major versions of iOS are always released before the launch of a new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> lineup in September. This year, the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a> lineup is expected to launch on Friday, September 20. As a result, &zwnj;macOS Sequoia&zwnj; could not only be the earliest macOS release in over a decade, but also the first simultaneous iOS/macOS release ever, or even the first time a new version of macOS has been released before the new version of iOS.<br/>
<br/>
Apple is almost certain to share more information about the release of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a> and &zwnj;macOS Sequoia&zwnj; at its event on Monday, September 9, where it is also set to unveil the &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; lineup, new Apple Watch models, and the fourth-generation AirPods.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/08/macos-sequoia-earliest-release-in-years/">macOS Sequoia Release Likely to Be the Earliest in Years</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/macos-sequoia-release-likely-to-be-the-earliest-in-years.2435348/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It's almost glowtime! Early September is always new iPhone time and this year is no exception, so buckle up for a busy event on Monday.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/top-stories-7sep2024.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-964318" /><br/>
While we're expecting quite a few product announcements at Monday's event, anticipated updates for a number of other hardware products won't be coming until later this year or into 2025, so read on below for all the details on what you should and shouldn't be banking on for next week.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Everything to Expect From the 'It's Glowtime' Apple Event</h2><br/>
Apple's annual fall iPhone event is right around the corner, kicking off on Monday at 10:00 a.m. Pacific Time. In addition to new iPhone 16 models, we're also expecting refreshes for all of the Apple Watches, new AirPods 4, and perhaps some other surprises.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/Its-Glowtime-What-to-Expect-Thumb-2.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-964234" /><br/>
Ahead of the event, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-september-2024-event-what-to-expect/">we've put together a complete guide</a> covering details on all of the hardware updates we're expecting to see. As usual, we'll also be getting final details and release dates for Apple's next set of major operating system updates, headlined by iOS 18.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>How Much Will the iPhone 16 Cost?</h2><br/>
With some significant hardware improvements coming to the iPhone 16 lineup to support Apple Intelligence features and new camera capabilities, many potential customers are <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/06/how-much-will-iphone-16-cost/">wondering if Apple will be raising prices</a> on the new models.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/iPhone-15-vs-16-Feature-Yellow-Pink-2.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-936648" /><br/>
Current starting prices include the iPhone 15 at &#36;799, the iPhone 15 Plus at &#36;899, the iPhone 15 Pro at &#36;999, and the iPhone 15 Pro Max at &#36;1,199. At a minimum, one analyst firm expects the price of the iPhone 16 Pro to rise to &#36;1,099 due in part to an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/06/both-iphone-16-pro-models-256gb-base-storage/">increase in base storage from 128GB to 256GB</a>, matching a change made with the Pro Max model last year.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Apple Likely to Launch M4 Macs in November</h2><br/>
While we're not expecting new Macs at Monday's event, Apple is preparing to transition its entire lineup to the M4 family of chips, and we're hearing from our own sources that a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/01/apple-likely-to-launch-m4-macs-in-november/">first batch of releases is likely to come in November</a>. That doesn't rule out a late October announcement, but availability is looking more like November.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/04/M4-AI-Optimized-Feature-Teal.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-945901" /><br/>
<em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman has indicated we can expect updated MacBook Pro, iMac, and Mac mini models in this round, with the rest of the Mac lineup transitioning to the M4 chips starting early next year.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Gurman: Apple Event in October Will Include New iPad Mini</h2><br/>
Amid shortages of the current model and rumored upgrades, there has been speculation about whether Apple will be introducing an updated iPad mini at Monday's event, but it looks like that won't be happening just yet. According to <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman, the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/06/new-ipad-mini-rumored-for-october/">iPad mini is likely to come as part of an October event</a> that will also feature the M4 Mac updates. It would make sense for a new entry-level iPad to come at the same time, but we haven't heard much about that potential update.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/09/iPad-mini-review-thumb.jpg" alt="" width="4114" height="2314" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-818321" /><br/>
One other product that had been speculated about for a potential September update was a minor update for the AirPods Max bringing a USB-C port and some fresh colors, but it <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/06/new-airpods-max-and-apple-tv-unlikely/">appears that's not in the cards quite yet either</a>. Same story for an updated Apple TV.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>iPhone SE 4 to Complete Apple's Switch to OLED Across iPhone Lineup</h2><br/>
We've been hearing for quite some time that the next-generation iPhone SE will be a significant upgrade for Apple's budget phone, transitioning away from the iPhone 8-style design with a Touch ID Home button and large top and bottom bezels to an all-screen design with Face ID.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/iPhone-SE-4-Thumb-1.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-951978" /><br/>
Rumors out of the Japanese display industry indicate that the display changes will involve a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/03/iphone-se-4-complete-apple-switch-oled/">shift to OLED technology</a>, marking an end to the production of iPhone models with LCD displays. As for when we can expect the fourth-generation iPhone SE to launch, rumors point to early next year.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple is hosting an online streaming event for the public and press on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/26/apple-september-9-iphone-event/">Monday, September 9, 2024 at 10:00 a.m. Pacific Time</a>. The company is expected to announce its new iPhone 16 lineup alongside new Apple Watch models, and potentially <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/30/apple-september-2024-event-new-products-expected/">other products during the event</a>, dubbed "It's Glowtime." Here's how you can watch it and when, wherever you are in the world.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/08/its-glowtime-event-youtube.jpeg" alt="" width="1280" height="720" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-962411" /><br/>
There are multiple ways to watch the September 9 event, with details listed below. We've also included a useful guide on when the event will take place in your particular time zone.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Apple Events Website</h2><br/>
With the <a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-events/">Apple Events website</a>, you can watch the event live on a Mac, iPhone, ‌iPad‌, PC, or any other device with a web browser. The Apple Events website works in Safari, Chrome, Firefox, and other main browsers.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/glowtime-events-page.jpg" alt="" width="2806" height="1520" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-963567" /><br/>
Just navigate to <a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-events/">www.apple.com/apple-events/</a> using a web browser at the appropriate time to watch. You can visit the site now to add an event reminder to your calendar.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>YouTube</h2><br/>
Apple also plans to stream the event <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uarNiSl_uh4">live on YouTube</a>, which is perhaps the easiest and most efficient way to watch because the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uarNiSl_uh4">YouTube live stream</a> can be viewed on every platform where YouTube is available, which is pretty much all platforms, from smartphones and tablets to consoles and smart TVs.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uarNiSl_uh4?si=NkmtqnDiqrhwAMz0" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><br/>
Apple has <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uarNiSl_uh4">posted a placeholder for the September 9 event</a> on YouTube, and you can visit it now to set an event reminder.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Apple TV App</h2><br/>
Apple used to have a dedicated Apple Events app on the Apple TV, but ahead of WWDC 2020, it was <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2020/06/18/events-app-apple-tv-app-wwdc/">folded into the Apple TV app</a>. On event day, there will be a prominent ‌Apple TV‌ app section dedicated to the live stream, which can be watched on any device where the ‌Apple TV‌ app is available.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/06/appleevents1.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1112" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-746566" /><br/>
This includes the ‌Apple TV‌, iPhones, iPads, and Macs, as well as select smart TVs, streaming devices, and gaming consoles. If you have an ‌Apple TV‌, the ‌Apple TV‌ app is one of the best ways to watch the event live. Apple hasn't updated the ‌Apple TV‌ app with the new event as of yet, but it should be added soon.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple will hold its annual fall iPhone-centric event on Monday, September 9 at 10:00 a.m. Pacific Time. There are multiple new devices on the horizon, including new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a> models, refreshes for all of the Apple Watches, new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airpods-4/">AirPods 4</a>, and perhaps some other surprises.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/d5BA0CZLhlw" title="Apple&#39;s &quot;It&#39;s Glowtime&quot; Event: What to Expect for iPhone 16, Apple Watch, &amp; More!" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><br/>
This guide highlights everything that we might see at Apple's "It's Glowtime" event based on current rumors.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="iphone_16_and_iphone_16_plus">iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus</h2><br/>
The &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; and 16 Plus will look almost identical to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a> and &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; Plus, with few design changes planned, but there are new capabilities to look forward to.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/iPhone-16-Camera-Lozenge-2-Perspective.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-935161" /><br/>
Apple plans to bring the Action Button to the &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; Plus, so it won't be a Pro-exclusive feature anymore and will be available on all &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; models. The Action Button can be set to turn on a Focus mode, activate a Shortcut, open the Camera, activate the Flashlight, and more. With <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a>, it can do even more because you can also assign Control Center controls to the Action Button, and third-party developers can now make Control Center options.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/iphone-16-colors-dummies.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-960310" /><em>Dummy models featuring the rumored &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; colors</em></div><br/>
Along with the Action Button, all &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; models could have a Capture Button, located on the right side of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> below the Power Button. On U.S. iPhones, it will be located where the mmWave antenna is on the &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; models, with the antenna moving to the left with the &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; lineup. While most rumors have suggested it's coming to all models, there is a chance that it could be limited to the Pro models. <br/>
<br/>
The Capture Button will be used to take images and video, and it will respond to pressure and touch for extra gesture support. A light press will autofocus, while a harder press will take the shot. Swiping left and right will zoom in or out, and there may also be an option for swapping between photo and video modes.<br/>
<br/>
Rather than the diagonal camera that Apple has used for the last several &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; models, the &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; and 16 Plus will have a vertical camera arrangement for the dual-lens camera system. The vertical arrangement could allow for the iPhones to capture spatial video for the Vision Pro.<br/>
<br/>
The Main camera isn't expected to get an upgrade, but Apple might boost the aperture of the Ultra Wide camera to improve low-light performance and add support for macro mode for the first time.<br/>
<br/>
There will be new colors for the &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; models, with some rumors suggesting we'll see black, green, light pink, blue, and white for five total color options, and other rumors pointing toward green, white, pink, and blue. In both of these scenarios, the white replaces the yellow Apple used for the &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; models. Apple is rumored to be using the color-infused back glass that it used for the &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj;, but with a frosted effect for the glass that contrasts with the frame color.<br/>
<br/>
Apple could opt for a more power efficient OLED display that might improve battery life while also increasing overall brightness.<br/>
<br/>
A18 chips will be in all the &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; models, which means the standard &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; Plus will support the Apple Intelligence features that are coming in &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj;. There could also be some iPhone-specific Apple Intelligence functionality that hasn't yet been announced.<br/>
<br/>
The A18 chips will be built on TSMC's 3-nanometer process, with Apple expected to include Neural Engine improvements for Apple Intelligence. Both &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; models will get 8GB RAM, up from 6GB in the prior-generation models in order to support AI. Apple may also be planning for a new thermal design that will combat overheating and improve performance.<br/>
<br/>
There could be some minor increases to battery life for the standard &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; model, as it is rumored to be getting a minor capacity boost. Depending on the chip efficiency, we could see some small improvements for both models, but that will depend on how much battery the new features eat up.<br/>
<br/>
While a recent rumors suggested the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/">iPhone 16 Pro</a> could see a price hike pushing the entry-level configuration to &#36;1,099 while boosting storage from 128 GB to 256 GB, <em>Bloomberg</em>'s <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a> believes it will <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/09/iphone-16-pro-999-rumor/">continue to start at &#36;999</a>, suggesting a storage boost is unlikely.<br/>
<br/>
We have more on the features <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">coming to the iPhone 16 in our roundup</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="iphone_16_pro_and_iphone_16_pro_max">iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max</h2><br/>
Like the &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; models, the &zwnj;iPhone 16 Pro&zwnj; and Pro Max will get the all-new Capture Button, and in these devices, it will be accompanied by some camera improvements.<br/>
<br/>
Apple is planning for a 48-megapixel Ultra Wide lens that uses pixel binning down to 12-megapixels, and the end result is basically much better performance in low-light for your wide-angle shots and your macro photos. The 5x Telephoto lens that was limited to the 15 Pro Max will be coming to the 16 Pro, so both Pro models will have it this time around.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/iPhone-16-Pro-Left-Side-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-928696" /><br/>
The &zwnj;iPhone 16 Pro&zwnj; models may be able to record 4K video at up to 120 frames per second, an increase over the current 60 frames per second limit when filming in 4K. Apple has also tested 8K recording, but it is not clear if that made it into the launch version of the device. Apple also plans to add a feature for pausing and resuming a video recording. <br/>
<br/>
Display size is getting bigger, and it's the first time we've seen an increase in display size since the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 12. The &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; display will measure in at 6.3 inches, up from 6.1, while the &zwnj;iPhone 16 Pro&zwnj; Max will have a 6.9-inch display, up from 6.7 inches. The change is not drastic, but it will be noticeable if you have an &zwnj;iPhone 16 Pro&zwnj; next to an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a>.<br/>
<br/>
There could be some improvements to the Main camera, and there's a chance the &zwnj;iPhone 16 Pro&zwnj; Max will have a new Sony sensor that offers higher-quality images with better dynamic range and noise control.<br/>
<br/>
We're also expecting the bezels around the edge of the display to be slimmed down, and Apple is rumored to be adopting more efficient OLED display technology, so we could see some improvements to brightness and contrast. According to <em>Bloomberg</em>'s &zwnj;Mark Gurman&zwnj;, the bezels could be <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/06/last-minute-apple-event-rumors/">about a third smaller</a>. <br/>
<br/>
All of the &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; models will get an A18 chip, but there could be variants. Apple could use a higher-end A18 chip with an extra GPU core in the Pro models, which would let all &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; devices run Apple Intelligence, but would still provide for some differentiation between the Pro and non-Pro models. A new thermal architecture with a graphene heatsink and metal battery casing is expected, and while the heatsink is also coming to the &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj;, the other thermal changes could be Pro only.<br/>
<br/>
Apple is expected to adopt Qualcomm's X75 5G modem in the Pro models for faster 5G speeds through carrier aggregation. The X75 has a combined mmWave and sub-6GHz transceiver rather than using separate hardware, so it's smaller and uses up less power.<br/>
<br/>
We could see improvements in battery life with the X75 chip and the A18 processor, plus Apple is using slightly bigger batteries with a 5 to 9 percent jump in capacity. There have been rumors that the &zwnj;iPhone 16 Pro&zwnj; models will support Wi-Fi 7, but that's also a feature Apple might hold until next year. As for storage, both Pro models <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/06/both-iphone-16-pro-models-256gb-base-storage/">could start with 256GB</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Early on, there were a few rumors about 20W <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe/">MagSafe</a> charging speeds and 40W wired charging speeds, but that's sounding like a long shot now. The microphone will have better water resistance and better sound thanks to AI. There may also be some &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; Pro-specific Apple Intelligence features that we don't know about yet.<br/>
<br/>
As with every new &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; launch, there are updated colors. We're expecting the standard black, white, and natural titanium options, but this year's special color is a shade of gold. Some rumors have described it as a bronze shade, and some dummy leaks have suggested that it's a darker brown color than Apple's prior gold selections, but color is so dependent on lighting that it's hard to say for sure. <em>Bloomberg</em>'s &zwnj;Mark Gurman&zwnj; says the shade "looks impressive and not terrible like the early renders."<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/08/sonny-iphone-16-pro-colors.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-961824" /><em>Early &zwnj;iPhone 16 Pro&zwnj; dummy models via <a href="https://x.com/sonnydickson/status/1824381930579824739?s=46">Sonny Dickson</a></em></div><br/>
<br/>
More detail on the &zwnj;iPhone 16 Pro&zwnj;'s expected features <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/">can be found in the iPhone 16 Pro roundup</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="apple_watch_series_10">Apple Watch Series 10</h2><br/>
Apple is refreshing the Apple Watch this year, but there are some ambiguities and questions about just what we'll see. 2024 marks the 10th anniversary of when the Apple Watch was introduced in September 2014, and it will be the "Series 10," but the Apple Watch <em>launched</em> in 2015. While there have been rumors of a major anniversary refresh, it's been unclear if that will happen this year or next year.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/apple-watch-series-9-orange.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-953899" /><br/>
The Apple Watch is expected to be slimmer than prior versions, and Apple is increasing the size. Rather than 41mm and 45mm models, it's looking like we'll get 45mm and 49mm options. Size could increase through a decrease in bezels and by making the casing itself larger. A 4mm jump will be a noticeable but not enormous size increase.<br/>
<br/>
There <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/26/alleged-first-look-at-apple-watch-x-series-10/">were CAD renders</a> of a next-generation Apple Watch with a 2-inch display, which is just slightly bigger than the 49mm Apple Watch Ultra display. That screen could be destined for the 49mm Series 10. Apple could boost water resistance with the design change, certifying the device for high-speed water sports up to 20 meters deep. The new Series 10 models may get the Depth app, which was first introduced for the Apple Watch Ultra. <br/>
<br/>
Aside from the increase in size and the thinner design, the updated models are said to look like the current Apple Watch models with no radical changes. Early on, <em>Bloomberg</em>'s &zwnj;Mark Gurman&zwnj; said that Apple was working on a new magnetic band attachment system, but it's no longer sounding like that's a feature we're going to get this year.<br/>
<br/>
Apple will update the OLED display to be more energy efficient, and with a bigger casing, battery size may increase too, leading to better battery life.<br/>
<br/>
Apple is reportedly planning to include an updated heart rate and ECG sensor in the Apple Watch Series 10 that will enable new features like sleep apnea detection. Sleep apnea detection has been long rumored for the Series 10, but it was unclear if it would be implemented at launch because of an ongoing patent dispute that has seen Apple disable blood oxygen detection in the current-generation Apple watch models in the U.S. <br/>
<br/>
Sleep apnea causes a person to stop breathing while asleep, which can lead to excessive tiredness. It is usually diagnosed through a sleep study, and fixing it requires a breathing apparatus like a CPAP machine. The Apple Watch Series 10 and Ultra 2 will reportedly be able to detect sleep apnea using Apple Watch sleep tracking, providing a reading after collecting sleep data for several days.<br/>
<br/>
Apple also wanted to include blood pressure monitoring, but that feature was not ready for launch and will not be included in the Series 10.<br/>
<br/>
For the last several years, the Apple Watch has used an S-series chip that's changed little, but this year's S10 is expected to bring a notable upgrade in performance. While the Apple Watch <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/06/last-minute-apple-event-rumors/">will not get</a> "major" Apple Intelligence capabilities, there could perhaps be AI features tied to a future health coach service, according to <em>Bloomberg</em>'s &zwnj;Mark Gurman&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
We will undoubtedly be getting new band colors alongside the updated models, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/09/apple-may-introduce-redesigned-milanese-loop/">potentially a redesigned Milanese Loop</a>.<br/>
<br/>
We have additional details on what to expect for the Apple Watch <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-watch-x/">in our roundup</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="apple_watch_ultra_2_color_update">Apple Watch Ultra 2 Color Update</h2><br/>
While we had been expecting that any new hardware improvements for the Apple Watch Series 10 would likely make their way into a new Apple Watch Ultra 3, a last-minute rumor claims we will not be getting a new generation of Apple's premium smartwatch.<br/>
<br/>
Instead, Gurman indicates the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch-ultra/">Apple Watch Ultra 2</a> may simply be made available in a new black color option, something that was rumored for last year at this model's introduction but did not occur.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/apple-watch-ultra-blue.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-952114" /><br/>
<h2 id="apple_watch_se_3">Apple Watch SE 3</h2><br/>
The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch-se/">Apple Watch SE</a> 3 could get a refresh this fall, and there are rumors that Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/05/apple-watch-se-plastic/">will use a plastic casing</a> rather than an aluminum casing for the device.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/09/apple-watch-se-gen-2.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-865510" /><br/>
A rigid plastic material would keep costs down, while also being more durable than aluminum in terms of scratches and drops. Such an Apple Watch could also be made in an array of bright colors, which would appeal to children.<br/>
<br/>
Apple has been promoting the Apple Watch as an option for parents who want to give their kids a device for communication and safety, and a lower-cost &zwnj;Apple Watch SE&zwnj; could help and also differentiate the device from the aluminum Apple Watch models.<br/>
<br/>
Apple has not used plastic for the casing of a device since the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 5c, a phone that came in vibrant blue, yellow, pink, and green colors. Aside from a new material, the &zwnj;Apple Watch SE&zwnj; is expected to have the same general design with no updates and no other feature changes except for an improved chip.<br/>
<br/>
<em>Bloomberg</em>'s &zwnj;Mark Gurman&zwnj; says in a last-minute rumor that he <a href="https://twitter.com/markgurman/status/1832955583177388435">"wouldn't rule out a delay" for the new Apple Watch SE</a>, but whether this means we may not see an announcement at all or perhaps simply a later time frame for availability than expected is unclear.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="airpods_4">AirPods 4</h2><br/>
There are two versions of the &zwnj;AirPods 4&zwnj; in the works, both of which feature a new design. The updated AirPods will look like a cross between the current AirPods and the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/">AirPods Pro</a>, with Apple adopting a shorter stem. <em>Bloomberg</em>'s &zwnj;Mark Gurman&zwnj; says there <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/19/gurman-airpods-4-this-year/">will be an updated fit</a>, but it's not yet clear what that means.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/airpods-3-orange.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-953897" /><br/>
The higher-priced &zwnj;AirPods 4&zwnj; will have Active Noise Cancellation, a feature that has previously been limited to the &zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj; and the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-max/">AirPods Max</a>. The lower-end model will be a direct upgrade to the current <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods/">AirPods 3</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Pricing on these new models isn't known yet. The &zwnj;AirPods 3&zwnj; cost &#36;179 (with &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; case), the AirPods 2 are &#36;129, and the &zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj; 2 are &#36;249, so Apple needs to price the new model somewhere in the middle. The lower-cost &zwnj;AirPods 4&zwnj; could get a price drop to put it closer in line with the AirPods 2, which will be discontinued, and the ANC model could be priced between &#36;180 and &#36;200, well below the &zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
Apple is going to update the &zwnj;AirPods 4&zwnj; case, and it could have a new look. It will get a speaker for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/find-my/">Find My</a>, allowing it to play a sound when lost, and it'll have a USB-C port for charging instead of a Lightning port. &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; charging will also still be a feature.<br/>
<br/>
Depending on design, the ANC probably won't be on par with the ANC in the &zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj; as those have silicone ear tips, but there are rumors of improvements to sound quality.<br/>
<br/>
Eventually, Apple plans to announce hearing aid replacement functionality for the AirPods, plus it will add an option for conducting hearing tests with the earbuds. These features may not be available when the AirPods launch, instead coming at a later date.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="airpods_max">AirPods Max</h2><br/>
Apple plans to refresh the &zwnj;AirPods Max&zwnj; in 2024, but don't get excited. We aren't expecting any new features except for a USB-C port instead of a Lightning port, some minor audio improvements, and possibly new color options. While it was initially thought that this update might not arrive until later in the year, perhaps simply via a press release, Gurman has indicated at the last minute that they are indeed expected to be introduced at Monday's event.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/Airpods-Max-Feature-Green-Triad.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-936393" /><br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="other_unlikely_possibilities">Other Unlikely Possibilities</h2><br/>
<h3 id="ipad_mini_7">iPad mini 7</h3><br/>
The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ipad-mini-7/">iPad mini 7</a> could see an update in 2024, but it likely won't be coming at Apple's September event. Apple is said to be planning to hold a second event in October 2024, and it would make more sense for the new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-mini/">iPad mini</a> to come out then alongside new M4 Macs. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/09/ipad-mini-green.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-862965" /><br/>
Few changes are expected for the next-generation &zwnj;iPad mini&zwnj;, and it will continue to have an 8.3-inch display size with <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/touch-id/">Touch ID</a> power button. There could be a small change to the display to cut down on the "jelly scrolling" effect that some people complained about with the &zwnj;iPad mini&zwnj; 6. Jelly scrolling refers to the sometimes noticeable lag when scrolling vertically through text-based content like a webpage.<br/>
<br/>
We are expecting the &zwnj;iPad mini&zwnj; to have a variant of the A17 or A18 chip that is compatible with Apple Intelligence, and we could get new colors, an upgraded front-facing camera, and support for Wi-Fi 6E.<br/>
<br/>
<h3 id="ipad_11">iPad 11</h3><br/>
The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> hasn't been refreshed since 2022, and it is overdue for an update. There are rumors suggesting we could get a new model in 2024, but it too will likely come out later in the year. <br/>
<br/>

There are no rumors about new features for the next-generation &zwnj;iPad&zwnj;, but it is expected to get a better A-series chip.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="software_updates">Software Updates</h2><br/>
&zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj;, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-18/">iPadOS 18</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sequoia/">macOS Sequoia</a>, tvOS 18, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/watchos-11/">watchOS 11</a>, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/visionos-2/">visionOS 2</a> are in beta testing, and at the fall event, Apple will give us a heads up on when the new operating system updates will be released.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/iOS-18-on-iPhone-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-955605" /><br/>
Typically &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj; and its sister updates come out just a few days ahead of when new iPhones launch, so if the &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; models launch on Friday, September 20 after their September 9 debut date, we could see the software come out earlier in the week of September 20.<br/>
<br/>
There may also be Apple Intelligence features that are exclusive to the &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; models that Apple has been keeping under wraps, so there may be some software-based surprises coming.<br/>
<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[The upcoming Apple Watch Series 10 and Ultra 3 models that Apple will introduce next week could include an updated heart rate and ECG sensor that will enable new health features like sleep apnea detection, reports <em><a href="https://9to5mac.com/2024/09/06/apple-watch-series-10-ecg-water-resistance/">9to5Mac</a></em>. Sleep apnea detection has been long rumored for the Series 10, but it was believed to rely on blood oxygen monitoring, a feature that is disabled in current-generation U.S. Apple Watch models due to patent issues.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/apple-watch-series-9-pink.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-948907" /><br/>
Sleep apnea causes a person to stop breathing while asleep, which can lead to excessive tiredness. It is usually diagnosed through a sleep study, and fixing it requires a breathing apparatus like a CPAP machine. The Apple Watch Series 10 and Ultra 3 will reportedly be able to detect sleep apnea using Apple Watch sleep tracking, providing a reading after collecting sleep data for several days.<br/>
<br/>
Apple analyst <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/">Ming-Chi Kuo</a> has said that the new Apple Watch Series 10 models will have larger 45mm and 49mm display sizes, but <em>9to5Mac</em> claims that the resolutions are lower than current 45mm and 49mm models, and the site believes that the Series 10 will come in 44mm and 48mm sizes. The new watch sizes will be highlighted by a new "Reflections" watch face, as well as a "Regatta" Hermès watch face.<br/>
<br/>
The Hermès watch face will also be available on the Apple Watch Ultra 3, hinting at the first Hermès band for the Ultra. An Hermès band with what could be titanium lugs <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/hermes-edition-owners-thread.1999198/page-536?post=33358773#post-33358773">was recently spotted on eBay</a>, further suggesting that Hermès will design bands for the larger, more rugged Apple Watch.<br/>
<br/>
With the display size increase and a redesign that will see the new model offering reduced thickness, Apple could also boost water resistance, certifying the device for high-speed water sports up to 20 meters deep. The new Series 10 models may get the Depth app, which was first introduced for the Apple Watch Ultra.<br/>
<br/>
Other new features coming to the Series 10 include an upgraded S10 chip and new OLED display technology that is more power efficient. More information on rumors we've heard about the Series 10 <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-watch-x/">can be found in our guide</a>.<br/>
<br/>
There are no other features planned for the Apple Watch Ultra, and though not mentioned in the report, Apple also plans to refresh the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch-se/">Apple Watch SE</a>.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch/">Apple Watch Series 9</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch">Apple Watch (Don't Buy)</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/06/apple-watch-series-10-upgraded-sensor/">Apple Watch Series 10 Could Have Upgraded Heart Rate Sensor and Better Water Resistance</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-watch-series-10-could-have-upgraded-heart-rate-sensor-and-better-water-resistance.2435247/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

Apple Watch inventory routinely dwindles ahead of new models launching. At its <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/26/apple-september-9-iphone-event/">special event on Monday</a>, Apple is expected to announce Apple Watch Series 10 models with larger displays and a thinner design, an Apple Watch SE 3 that might have a plastic casing, and an Apple Watch Ultra 3 with internal upgrades, including a faster chip.<br/>
<br/>
Apple Watch SE 2 configurations selling out supports the expectation of an Apple Watch SE 3. The current Apple Watch SE was released in 2022.<br/>
