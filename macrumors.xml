		<description><![CDATA[<a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0DLHCWH55%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1">Amazon</a> and <a href="https://howl.link/o2iokizxm136a">Best Buy</a> are discounting Apple's 13-inch M2 MacBook Air with 16GB of RAM and 256GB SSD storage down to <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0DLHCWH55%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1"><strong>&#36;799.00</strong></a> in every color. This is a &#36;200 discount on the M2 MacBook Air, and neither sale requires any coupon code in order to see the final deal price.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/m3-macbook-air-orange.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-944158" /><em><small>Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with Amazon and Best Buy. When you click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment, which helps us keep the site running.</small></em><br/>
<br/>
Compared to past sales, this is a match of the all-time low price on this model of the M2 MacBook Air. Although this is a previous generation device, it remains in Apple's current lineup and will work great for anyone who doesn't need the performance gains introduced with the M3 chip, especially at this discounted price.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://howl.link/o2iokizxm136a"target="_blank"><div class="fancybutton"><div class="fancybadge">&#36;200 OFF</div>13-inch M2 MacBook Air (16GB/256GB) for &#36;799.00</div></a></div><br/>
<br/>
There are a few deals on the M3 MacBook Air, and these are all located at Amazon. You can get the 13-inch M3 MacBook Air with 16GB of RAM and 512GB SSD storage for <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0CX21ZSBM%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"><strong>&#36;1,099.00</strong></a> on Amazon, down from &#36;1,299.00. Only the Space Gray color is available at this record low price.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0CX21ZSBM%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"target="_blank"><div class="fancybutton"><div class="fancybadge">&#36;200 OFF</div>13-inch M3 MacBook Air (16GB/512GB) for &#36;1,099.00</div></a></div><br/>
<br/>
Finally, if you are looking for a larger model, Amazon has the 15-inch M3 MacBook Air with 16GB of RAM and 512GB SSD storage for <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0CX24BN3L%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"><strong>&#36;1,299.00</strong></a>, down from &#36;1,499.00. This one is available in three colors on Amazon, and it's another match of the record low price on the M3 MacBook Air.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0CX24BN3L%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"target="_blank"><div class="fancybutton"><div class="fancybadge">&#36;200 OFF</div>15-inch M3 MacBook Air (16GB/512GB) for &#36;1,299.00</div></a></div><br/>

		<description><![CDATA[While the so-called "<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17/#iphone_17_air">iPhone 17 Air</a>" is not expected to launch until September, there are already plenty of rumors about the "ultra-thin" device.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/10/iPhone-17-Slim-Feature-Single-Camera-1-Redux.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-974628" /><br/>
Overall, the "iPhone 17 Air" is shaping up to be a mixed bag. Due to its thinness, the device is expected to have some limited specifications compared to the iPhone 17 Pro models, including only a single rear camera, only a single speaker, no SIM card slot worldwide, and an A19 chip instead of the more powerful A19 Pro chip. Of course, the device will also be equipped with a smaller battery than other iPhone 17 models.<br/>
<br/>
Below, we recap 10 key changes rumored for the "iPhone 17 Air" as of January 2025:<ul><li>The thinnest iPhone ever, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/10/iphone-17-air-details-ming-chi-kuo/">measuring just 5.5mm at its thinnest point</a></li><br/>

<li><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/18/iphone-17-air-rumored-features/">8GB of RAM</a> for Apple Intelligence support</li><br/>
<li>A <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/18/iphone-17-air-rumored-features/">single 48-megapixel rear camera</a></li><br/>
<li>A <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/18/iphone-17-air-rumored-features/">24-megapixel front camera</a></li><br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple is making it easier for iPhone, iPad, and Mac users in the U.S. to donate towards wildfire recovery efforts in the Los Angeles, California area.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/01/App-Store-American-Red-Cross-LA-Wildfire-Donations.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-985432" /><br/>
Apple has added an American Red Cross donation flow to the App Store and Apple Music apps.<br/>
<br/>
"Our hearts go out to all impacted by the ongoing devastation in LA," said Apple CEO Tim Cook, in a <a href="https://x.com/tim_cook/status/1879532175194001542">social media post</a> today. "In addition to Apple's donation, we're making it easy to support recovery efforts. If you're in the US, just open the App Store or Apple Music & click to donate to help make a difference." He also shared a <a href="https://apple.co/southerncaliforniawildfires">direct link</a> to the donation flow.<br/>
<br/>
Last week, Apple said it would be <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/09/apple-to-donate-to-la-wildfire-recovery-efforts/">making its own donation</a> towards recovery efforts on the ground. Apple frequently donates towards recovery efforts following natural disasters around the world, but it typically does not disclose the donation amount.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/american-red-cross/">American Red Cross</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tim-cook/">Tim Cook</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/15/app-store-red-cross-la-wildfire-donations/">Apple Makes It Easy to Donate to Red Cross&#039;s LA Wildfire Relief Efforts</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-makes-it-easy-to-donate-to-red-crosss-la-wildfire-relief-efforts.2447430/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[In September, Apple said that it would be <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/04/beats-teases-powerbeats-pro-2/">launching Powerbeats Pro 2 in 2025</a>, and now further evidence of the wireless earbuds has surfaced.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/01/apple-power-beats-pro-2.jpg" alt="" width="2250" height="1266" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-985456" /><em>Powerbeats Pro 2 images found in iOS 18 code</em></div><br/>
Apple submitted Powerbeats Pro 2 regulatory documents to the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) in mid-December. The documents were made available to the public this week, and they were <a href="https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/apple-beats-powerbeats-pro-2-specifications-fcc-bis/">spotted by <em>91Mobiles</em></a>.<br/>
<br/>
The documents confirm that Apple has continued to take the necessary steps to launch the Powerbeats Pro 2 this year. They also reveal that the left and right earbuds will have model numbers of A3157 and A3158, respectively, while the charging case will be A3160. Beyond that, we have not uncovered any significant details.<br/>
<br/>
Apple also submitted Powerbeats Pro 2 regulatory documents to the Bureau of Indian Standards in November, according to the <em>91Mobiles</em> report.<br/>
<br/>
Powerbeats Pro are a sportier, fitness-focused alternative to AirPods Pro with built-in, adjustable ear hooks for a secure fit. Apple's teaser video last year showed MLB star Shohei Ohtani wearing the Powerbeats Pro 2, revealing a more vertical, slimmer design compared to the original Powerbeats Pro, which are now <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/18/apple-discontinues-powerbeats-pro/">discontinued</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/Powerbeats-Pro-2-Teaser-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-963687" /><em>MLB star Shohei Ohtani wearing the Powerbeats Pro 2</em></div><br/>
We previously reported that the Powerbeats Pro 2 will offer <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/09/powerbeats-pro-2-heart-rate/">heart rate monitoring during workouts</a>. Based on our iOS 18 code findings, you will be able to connect the Powerbeats Pro 2 to gym equipment like a treadmill to measure heart rate, and the data will be visible in the Health app and other supported apps on the iPhone.<br/>
<br/>
We also confirmed that Powerbeats Pro 2 will support Active Noise Cancellation, Spatial Audio, and Adaptive Audio. The earbuds and charging case will be available in orange, purple, black, or beige, and the case should have a USB-C port.<br/>
<br/>
Based on other recent Beats headphones, other potential upgrades for the Powerbeats Pro 2 include improved sound quality, longer battery life, and improved cross-platform compatibility with Android features like Find My Device.<br/>
<br/>
Apple did not reveal a specific release date in 2025 for the Powerbeats Pro 2, but the regulatory filings hint at a launch within the next few months.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/beats/">Beats</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/powerbeats-pro/">Powerbeats Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/15/powerbeats-pro-2-regulatory-filings/">Powerbeats Pro 2 Filed in Regulatory Databases Ahead of 2025 Launch</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/powerbeats-pro-2-filed-in-regulatory-databases-ahead-of-2025-launch.2447429/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple CEO Steve Jobs <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2008/01/15Apple-Introduces-MacBook-Air-The-Worlds-Thinnest-Notebook/">announced</a> the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/">MacBook Air</a> 17 years ago today at the Macworld Conference & Expo in San Francisco, captivating audiences with a groundbreaking design that set new industry standards.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/01/MacBook-Air-17-Years-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-985387" /><br/>
Jobs famously revealed the &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; by pulling it out of an interoffice envelope to emphasize its unprecedentedly slim profile. The original model featured a 13.3-inch display, Intel Core 2 Duo processor, and an optional 64GB solid-state drive, which was a rarity for consumer laptops in 2008, in a sleek aluminum unibody design. It lacked features considered standard at the time, such as an optical drive and Ethernet port. The single headphone, USB, and Micro-DVI ports popped out of a small door on the right of the machine. Jobs said:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote>We've built the world's thinnest notebook — without sacrificing a full-size keyboard or a full-size 13-inch display. When you first see MacBook Air, it's hard to believe it's a high-performance notebook with a full-size keyboard and display. But it is.</blockquote><br/>
<br/>
Seventeen years later, the &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; remains a cornerstone of the Mac lineup, providing the entry-level point for customers who want an Apple laptop. In 2020, Apple brought its own custom silicon processor to the &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; in the form of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m1/">M1</a> chip, enabling a massive leap in performance and energy efficiency. It completely redesigned the machine in 2022, and added a 15-inch model in 2024. In the first half of this year, Apple is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/2025-macbook-air/">expected to bring</a> its latest-generation M-series chips to the device.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/">MacBook Air</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Air">13" MacBook Air (Caution)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macbook-air.122">MacBook Air</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/15/macbook-air-turns-17-today/">The MacBook Air Turns 17 Today</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/the-macbook-air-turns-17-today.2447421/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m4-mac-mini/">M4 Mac mini</a> is Apple's smallest desktop machine to date, measuring in at just five inches by five inches. It's small enough that it can be easily taken from one desktop setup to another, hence the reason behind a case for a desktop Mac.<br/>
<br/>
There is a plush interior pocket for the &zwnj;Mac mini&zwnj; power cord, along with a rear mesh pocket and a padded, zippered front pocket for SD cards, cords, and an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airtags/">AirTag</a> for tracking purposes.<br/>
<br/>
A nylon loop at the top allows the Shield Case to be carried or attached to another bag with a carabiner, and there are waterproof YKK zippers that can be locked with a padlock. A zipper guard ensures the zipper does not damage the &zwnj;Mac mini&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
The Shield Case can be <a href="https://www.sfbags.com/products/mac-mini-shield-case">purchased from the WaterField Designs website</a> for &#36;99, and it will ship out to customers this month.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/14/mac-mini-shield-case/">WaterField Designs Debuts Shield Case for Transporting Mac Mini</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/waterfield-designs-debuts-shield-case-for-transporting-mac-mini.2447408/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Ahead of the season two premiere of hit TV show Severance, Apple is marketing the show with a fun Severance pop-up at the Grand Central Terminal in New York City.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/01/severance-new-york-promo-1.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1124" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-985377" /><br/>
Apple has assembled a glass cube with workstations that are identical to the setups that Lumon employees use on the show, complete with employees "working," doing yoga, playing catch, throwing paper airplanes, sipping coffee, and performing other activities that we've seen on Severance.<br/>
<br/>

At 4:30 p.m. Eastern Time, Severance director Ben Stiller made an appearance at the site, with some of the show's actors visiting as well. Adam Scott, Zach Cherry, Patricia Arquette, Britt Lower, and Tramell Tillman were on hand and spent time in the makeshift office space, with the actors in character as their "innies."<br/>
<br/>

The performance went on for more two and a half hours, and the actors behaved as if they were actually at work at Lumon Industries. <br/>

		<description><![CDATA[OpenAI today said that it added a new "Tasks" beta feature to ChatGPT, allowing ChatGPT to provide reminders for upcoming tasks. The feature supports one-time reminders or recurring actions, with users able to use conversational language to set up notifications for tasks. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/open-ai-logo.jpg" alt="" width="1093" height="615" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-953560" /><br/>
ChatGPT is able to do things like send a weekly global news briefing, provide a daily 15-minute workout, set reminders for completing a task like language practice, send a daily joke, create a meal plan each evening, provide reminders about upcoming events like birthdays, and more. <br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Today we’re rolling out a beta version of tasks—a new way to ask ChatGPT to do things for you at a future time.<br><br>Whether it&#39;s one-time reminders or recurring actions, tell ChatGPT what you need and when, and it will automatically take care of it. <a href="https://t.co/7lgvsPehHv">pic.twitter.com/7lgvsPehHv</a></p>&mdash; OpenAI (@OpenAI) <a href="https://twitter.com/OpenAI/status/1879267274185756896?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 14, 2025</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div><br/>
Reminders can be created in chat or through the tasks page under the profile menu, though the "4o with scheduled tasks" model needs to be selected. The new model is still rolling out to subscribers. <br/>
<br/>
At the current time, Tasks is available to Plus, Pro, and Teams subscribers in a beta capacity, and in the future, it will be available to everyone with a ChatGPT account.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/openai/">OpenAI</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/14/chatgpt-task-support/">ChatGPT Gains Support for Reminders and Tasks</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/chatgpt-gains-support-for-reminders-and-tasks.2447402/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

The beta is available to registered developers, and can be downloaded from the Watch app on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>.<br/>
<br/>
There were no notable new features found in the update, but code suggests that Apple will add support for robot vacuums to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/homekit/">HomeKit</a>, which means it will be a supported category in the Home app in watchOS.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[The European Union is "reassessing" its investigations into big U.S. tech companies like Apple, Meta, and Google, claims <em><a href="https://www.ft.com/content/2c1b6bfd-ce73-451d-8123-0df964266ae8">Financial Times</a></em>, though a spokesperson from the European Commission has denied that such a review is taking place.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-932826" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/App-Store-vs-EU-Feature-2.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" /><br/>
Tech CEOs like Apple's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tim-cook/">Tim Cook</a> and Meta's Mark Zuckerberg have <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/03/tim-cook-trump-inauguration-donation/">been cozying up</a> to president-elect Donald Trump as he prepares to take office, and <em>Financial Times</em> suggests that probes launched under the Digital Markets Act could be scaled back. A senior EU diplomat told the site that "So much is up in the air right now," while other officials said that regulators are holding for "political direction" to make final decisions in cases involving Apple, Google, and Meta.<br/>
<br/>
A spokesperson for the European Commission told <em>Financial Times</em> that there is "no such review taking place," but that the EC has "upcoming meetings to assess the general readiness of an investigation." None of the cases are "ready at a technical level," but the EC remains "fully committed to the effective enforcement of its rules."<br/>
<br/>
The European Commission launched an investigation into Apple's compliance with the Digital Markets Act last year, and determined that it was <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/14/eu-plans-to-fine-apple-over-dma-report/">not in compliance</a>. A November report suggested that the European Commission is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/05/eu-apple-fine-anticompetitive-app-store-practices/">gearing up to fine Apple</a> for failing to implement changes allowing developers to steer users to cheaper prices outside of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Apple overhauled its &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; rules in Europe in 2024, and made several changes to satisfy regulators. European developers are able to distribute apps outside of the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj;, and there are new fee structures and policies in place.<br/>
<br/>
The EU in 2024 fined Apple &#36;2 billion for anticompetitive behavior against third-party music services, and if Apple is fined over DMA non-compliance, the fee could be higher. Under the DMA, the European Union is able to fine Apple up to 10 percent of its global annual sales.<br/>
<br/>
Back in October, Trump claimed that <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-says-apple-ceo-cook-called-him-with-concerns-about-eu-penalties-2024-10-17/">Cook called him</a> to complain about penalties from the European Union. At the time, Trump said that he is "not going to let them take advantage of our companies."<br/>
<br/>
With Margrethe Vestager and Thierry Breton having stepped down from the European Commission, priorities could change. The EC's chief spokesperson said that there could be a "political reality" that "puts pressure on the technical work." The EC "will be looking and assessing on the basis of concrete measures and actions from the new administration."<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/european-union/">European Union</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/14/eu-not-reassessing-apple-investigation/">EU Not Reassessing Apple and Google Antitrust Investigations, But New Administration Could Shift Priorities</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/eu-not-reassessing-apple-and-google-antitrust-investigations-but-new-administration-could-shift-priorities.2447397/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today released new firmware designed for the 25W <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe/">MagSafe</a> Charger that is compatible with the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> 12 and later and the latest AirPods and Apple Watch models. The updated firmware is version 2A143, up from the 2A138 firmware that the accessory shipped with. In the Settings app, you'll see a different version number than the internal firmware number.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/new-magsafe-charger.jpg" alt="" width="1764" height="992" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-965150" /><br/>
The 2024 &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; charger was released alongside the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a> models, and it is able to charge them at up to 25W. For the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 12 models to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a> models, charging is capped at 15W.<br/>
<br/>
Because firmware updates are released quietly over the air, Apple does not provide release notes. We do not know what new features or bug fixes might be included in the software.<br/>
<br/>
There is no clear method for updating a ‌&zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj;‌ charger's firmware, but it needs to be plugged in and connected to an Apple device for a firmware update to initiate.

It's now been over a month since we last saw a low price on the accessory, but this week Amazon has the stylus for <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0D3J71RM7%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"><strong>&#36;99.00</strong></a>, down from &#36;129.00.<br/>

<br/>
This is just about &#36;5 higher when compared to the all-time low price on the Apple Pencil Pro, but given that deals have been pretty rare recently, it's a great opportunity for anyone who's been waiting for a discount. This sale does not require any coupon codes to be clipped.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple recently announced that it will be <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/10/apple-miami-worldcenter/">opening an all-new retail store at the Miami Worldcenter</a> complex on Friday, January 24.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/01/Apple-Miami-Worldcenter-Render.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-985330" /><em>A pre-construction render of Apple Miami Worldcenter</em></div><br/>
We have since learned that Apple's retail store plans in Florida go slightly beyond that. In early December, the company closed its store at The Galleria shopping mall in Fort Lauderdale, and opened a new store across the hall from it. We have confirmed that the new store is a temporary location, meaning that the original store is likely undergoing renovations and will eventually reopen with a modernized design.<br/>
<br/>
"We've moved, but let's stay close," says the <a href="https://www.apple.com/retail/thegalleria/">page for Apple The Galleria</a>. "Visit us in our new location just across the hall."<br/>
<br/>
We do not know when the original store will reopen.<br/>
<br/>
Apple Store news isn't always especially interesting, but at least Apple released a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/10/apple-miami-worldcenter/">special iPhone, iPad, and Mac wallpaper</a> for the upcoming Miami Worldcenter location. And for an upcoming store in China, there is even <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/01/apple-store-mixc-hefei/">a special Apple Watch face</a>.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-store/">Apple Store</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/14/apple-store-plans-in-florida/">Apple Store Plans in Florida Go Beyond New Miami Worldcenter Location</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-store-plans-in-florida-go-beyond-new-miami-worldcenter-location.2447380/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple said the first vehicles with next-generation CarPlay would arrive in 2024. <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/01/next-generation-carplay-didnt-arrive-in-2024/">It didn't happen</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2015/02/carplay-next-gen-hero.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-969129" /><br/>
Now what?<br/>
<br/>
We are two weeks into 2025, and Apple has yet to update or remove the 2024 timeframe for next-generation CarPlay advertised on its website. Apple also remains completely silent about whether or not it still plans to launch the system.<br/>
<br/>
There are still a few signs of hope.<br/>
<br/>
First, <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2025/01/07/apple-prepping-next-gen-carplay/"><em>9to5Mac</em> recently reported</a> that additional references to next-generation CarPlay were added in iOS 18.3 beta 2's code. Second, <em>MacRumors</em> contributor Aaron Perris today uncovered some additional <a href="https://x.com/aaronp613/status/1879159569882190069">next-generation CarPlay images</a> that were filed in a EU database last month. Apple previously showed that next-generation CarPlay will feature customizable widgets, and the images provide a closer look at the widget selection screens.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Here is an upcoming look at widgets coming to CarPlay 2.0 <a href="https://t.co/2mwg3VjR7H">pic.twitter.com/2mwg3VjR7H</a></p>&mdash; Aaron (@aaronp613) <a href="https://twitter.com/aaronp613/status/1879159569882190069?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 14, 2025</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div><br/>
Due to Apple's reluctance to comment on future plans, we do not know if next-generation CarPlay is still happening. Hopefully, Apple will finally provide an update about next-generation CarPlay soon to set the record straight.<br/>
<br/>
Apple first previewed next-generation CarPlay at WWDC 2022, more than two and a half years ago. For now, the wait continues.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/carplay/">CarPlay</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/homepod-homekit-carplay-home-auto-technology.193">HomePod, HomeKit, CarPlay, Home & Auto Technology</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/14/next-generation-carplay-status-update/">Here&#039;s the Latest on Next-Generation CarPlay After Missed 2024 Launch</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/heres-the-latest-on-next-generation-carplay-after-missed-2024-launch.2447376/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Disney today announced that it is rolling out support for the Live Activities feature on iPhones for mobile food and beverage orders at its two big U.S. parks.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/01/Disney-Live-Activities-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="1931" height="1086" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-985288" /><br/>
The feature started rolling out today at select mobile order locations across Walt Disney World and Disneyland Resort, the company said. Where available, the feature allows you to track the status of your mobile order on the iPhone's Lock Screen or in the Dynamic Island, without needing to open the My Disney Experience or Disneyland apps.<br/>
<br/>
You can tap the "I'm Here, Prepare My Order" button to have your order freshly prepared, and view your order number, order status, and pickup location.<br/>
<br/>
Live Activities are available on the Lock Screen on all iPhone models that are updated to iOS 16.1 or later, while the Dynamic Island is limited to the iPhone 14 Pro models, all iPhone 15 models, and all iPhone 16 models. You may also need to ensure that your My Disney Experience or Disneyland app is updated to the latest version.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/disney/">Disney</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/live-activities/">Live Activities</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/14/disney-world-live-activities-for-mobile-orders/">Disney World and Disneyland Rolling Out Food Order Tracking on iPhone&#039;s Lock Screen</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/disney-world-and-disneyland-rolling-out-food-order-tracking-on-iphones-lock-screen.2447373/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple has backed a technology that could contribute to future <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/">Apple Intelligence</a> advancements.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/Apple-Intelligence-iPhone-16.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="898" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-964551" /><br/>
The consortium behind the "Ultra Accelerator Link" or "UALink" technology today <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250114920576/en">announced</a> that Apple, Alibaba, and Synopsys have joined its Board of Directors. The three companies will contribute to further development of the technology.<br/>
<br/>
UALink is described as a "high-speed, scale-up interconnect for next-generation AI cluster performance." The consortium is aiming to release UALink 1.0 in the first quarter of 2025, and it will enable data speeds of "up to 200Gbps per lane."<br/>
<br/>
The technology could pave the way for faster and more efficient Apple Intelligence servers.<br/>
<br/>
"UALink shows great promise in addressing connectivity challenges and creating new opportunities for expanding AI capabilities and demands," said Becky Loop, Director of Platform Architecture at Apple. Loop added that "Apple has a long history of pioneering and collaborating on innovations that drive our industry forward."<br/>
<br/>
It is not clear if or when Apple will adopt the technology, or if it is merely interested in helping out the overall AI industry.<br/>
<br/>
Apple Intelligence servers are currently powered by the M2 Ultra chip, and they are expected to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/06/apple-intelligence-servers-with-m4-chips-report/">start using M4 series chips</a> this year. In an eventual move away from Mac chips for server use, <em>The Information</em> recently reported that Apple has been <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/11/apple-intelligence-servers-new-chip-report/">developing a new AI server chip</a> that will offer even faster performance for AI workloads.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/">Apple Intelligence</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/14/apple-ualink/">New High-Speed Technology Paves Way for Apple Intelligence Upgrades</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/new-high-speed-technology-paves-way-for-apple-intelligence-upgrades.2447372/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple is nearing the start of mass production for its first U.S.-made A-series chips at TSMC's Arizona plant, <a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Tech/Semiconductors/Apple-in-final-stages-of-verifying-TSMC-s-Made-in-USA-chips"><em>Nikkei Asia</em></a> reports.<br/>

The report suggests that test production of the chips at the new TSMC plant near Phoenix has already been completed, and Apple is now in the final stages of verifying their quality and performance. The first batch of commercially viable chips could be ready for mass production as early as this quarter, pending the completion of quality assurance processes. <br/>
<br/>
The factory is expected to produce A-series chips used in Apple devices, primarily for older <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> models. A <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/08/apple-watch-chips-now-being-made-in-the-u-s/">recent report</a> suggested the facility would make the A16 Bionic chip for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a> and &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; Plus, and the S9 chip for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch-ultra/">Apple Watch Ultra 2</a>. The commencement of mass production at the Arizona plant will mark the first time Apple silicon chips are manufactured in the United States.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/nikkei-com/">Nikkei</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tsmc/">TSMC</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/united-states/">United States</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/14/first-iphone-chips-to-start-production-in-america/">First iPhone Chips Made in America Soon to Start Mass Production</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/first-iphone-chips-made-in-america-soon-to-start-mass-production.2447360/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today stopped signing iOS 18.2, which means that <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> users who have upgraded to iOS 18.2.1 can no longer downgrade to iOS 18.2. Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/06/apple-releases-ios-18-2-1/">released iOS 18.2.1</a> earlier in January.<br/>
<br/>

When new versions of iOS are released, Apple typically stops signing the prior version after a week or two. An update that is not signed is not able to be installed on an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; because there is a server-side software verification check.<br/>
<br/>
By preventing downgrading to older versions of iOS, Apple ensures that users keep their devices up to date with the newest security improvements.<br/>
<br/>
Apple's iOS 18.2.1 update included unspecified bug fixes, while the now-unsigned iOS 18.2 update <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ios-18-2-features/">that came out in December</a> added <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/">Apple Intelligence</a> features like <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/image-playground/">Image Playground</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a> ChatGPT integration, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/genmoji/">Genmoji</a>.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/13/apple-stops-signing-ios-18-2/">Apple Stops Signing iOS 18.2, Preventing Downgrading</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-stops-signing-ios-18-2-preventing-downgrading.2447342/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>
