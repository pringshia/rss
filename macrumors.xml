		<description><![CDATA[Apple is working on a new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-studio/">Mac Studio</a> that is likely to launch in the second half of 2024, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-01-07/apple-2024-plans-challenges-gen-ai-vision-pro-china-sales-app-store-changes-lr3k9p8p?"><em>Bloomberg</em></a>'s <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a> believes.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/M3-Mac-Pro-and-Studio-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-920519" /><br/>
Gurman mentioned the details in this weekend's edition of the <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-01-07/apple-2024-plans-challenges-gen-ai-vision-pro-china-sales-app-store-changes-lr3k9p8p?">"Power On" newsletter</a>. He explained that the new &zwnj;Mac Studio&zwnj; is likely to be offered with the as-yet-unannounced fourth variant of the M3 chip. This will, like previous generations, double the components of the "Max" version, meaning that it will feature up to 32 CPU cores and 80 GPU cores.<br/>
<br/>
Taiwanese research firm <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/05/m3-ultra-mac-studio-to-launch-in-mid-2024/">TrendForce believes</a> that Apple will launch a new &zwnj;Mac Studio&zwnj; featuring the M3 Ultra chip at WWDC in June, just as it did with the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m2/">M2</a> Max and &zwnj;M2&zwnj; Ultra &zwnj;Mac Studio&zwnj; last year. Prior to the launch of these models in 2023, Gurman reported that Apple was already working on two follow-up machines.<br/>
<br/>
Gurman also believes, contrary to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/05/m3-ultra-mac-studio-to-launch-in-mid-2024/">suggestions</a> earlier in the week, that Apple is likely to refresh the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-pro/">Mac Pro</a> with this new high-end chip. He does not believe that Apple is likely to again abandon the machine after only one year.<br/>
<br/>
He added that while upcoming devices such as the M3 <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/">MacBook Air</a> could be popular if marketed properly, the Mac roadmap for 2024 is looking "otherwise muted," suggesting some skepticism about Apple's ability to turn the Mac's underperforming sales around.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-studio/">Mac Studio</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-pro/">Mac Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/bloomberg-com/">Bloomberg</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-silicon/">Apple Silicon</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Mac-Studio">Mac Studio (Neutral)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Mac_Pro">Mac Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/mac-studio.237">Mac Studio</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/mac-pro.1">Mac Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/07/apple-working-on-new-mac-studio-and-mac-pro/">Apple Working on Next-Gen Mac Studio and Mac Pro</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-working-on-next-gen-mac-studio-and-mac-pro.2415704/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's Vision Pro headset is on the brink of launch as retail stores are beginning final preparations for the device to go on sale, according to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-01-07/apple-2024-plans-challenges-gen-ai-vision-pro-china-sales-app-store-changes-lr3k9p8p?"><em>Bloomberg</em></a>'s <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/Apple-Vision-Pro-with-battery-Feature-Blue-Magenta.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-898550" /><br/>
In the <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-01-07/apple-2024-plans-challenges-gen-ai-vision-pro-china-sales-app-store-changes-lr3k9p8p?">latest "Power On" newsletter</a>, Gurman said that the Vision Pro is now shipping in small quantities to warehouses across the United States ahead of direct distribution to Apple retail stores. While the company has not yet announced its release date, it apparently believes there will be sufficient stock ready in the country by the end of January to launch in February. Interestingly, Gurman expects Apple to make a Vision Pro-related announcement "in the next week or so" to "take some of the spotlight away from CES," which starts on Tuesday, January 9.<br/>
<br/>
On January 21, all Apple Stores in the United States will hold an unusual three-hour long meeting for all employees that will likely involve training and explanation of the sales procedure related to the device. Further training sessions are apparently planned for the subsequent days, followed by the reception of new inventory racks and backroom equipment.<br/>
<br/>
Gurman also noted that Luxshare, the Chinese assembler of the Vision Pro, held a delivery ceremony last month to mark the first official shipments of the completed product, and Apple has now purportedly filed design patents "for every hardware and software element of the device," which further suggests that launch is likely to be very soon.<br/>
<br/>
It remains unclear whether the Vision Pro will be immediately available via online pre-order. Apple may initially only offer an online reservation for an appointment at an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-store/">Apple Store</a> that would involve light seal and headband fitting. <br/>
<br/>
Gurman believes that the launch of Vision Pro in other countries around the world will not "actually be that much later" than its release in the United States. Apple is said to be considering the United Kingdom, Canada, and China as the next markets to receive the product.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/china/">China</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/bloomberg-com/">Bloomberg</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/canada/">Canada</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/united-kingdom/">United Kingdom</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/luxshare/">Luxshare</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-vision-pro.209">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/07/gurman-vision-pro-launch-imminent/">Gurman: Vision Pro Launch &#039;Imminent&#039; as Retail Stores Prepare</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/gurman-vision-pro-launch-imminent-as-retail-stores-prepare.2415695/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple is on schedule to announce a series of generative AI-based tools at its Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) in June, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-01-07/apple-2024-plans-challenges-gen-ai-vision-pro-china-sales-app-store-changes-lr3k9p8p?"><em>Bloomberg</em></a>'s <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a> reports.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/iOS-18-Mock-Siri-Feature-Baubles.jpg" alt="" width="2250" height="1266" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-909208" /><br/>
In the <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-01-07/apple-2024-plans-challenges-gen-ai-vision-pro-china-sales-app-store-changes-lr3k9p8p?">latest edition</a> of his "Power On" newsletter, Gurman reaffirmed and expanded upon previous comments related to Apple's plans to announce a series of new tools based on generative AI at WWDC as part of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a>, including a revamped version of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a>.<br/>
<br/>
The company has reportedly been testing its <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/07/19/apple-experimenting-with-chatgpt-tool/">"Ajax" large language model</a> since early 2023 and is considering using it to add auto-completion and auto-summarizing features to its core apps, as well as its productivity suite including Pages and Keynote. A new version of Xcode will apparently feature AI for code completion. It is also looking at integrating AI into <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/">Apple Music</a> to automate playlist creation, in addition using the technology for  troubleshooting problems with <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/applecare/">AppleCare</a>.<br/>
<br/>
However, Gurman believes that "the totality of Apple's generative AI vision will take at least into 2025 to fully scale," suggesting that not all planned features will arrive this year, and competitors like Samsung will do everything they can to highlight Apple's current "deficiency" in the AI space in the coming months.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/bloomberg-com/">Bloomberg</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-gpt/">Apple GPT</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/07/wave-of-apple-ai-tools-at-wwdc/">Wave of Apple Generative AI Tools on Track for WWDC Debut</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/wave-of-apple-generative-ai-tools-on-track-for-wwdc-debut.2415693/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple in 2020 <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2020/03/02/apple-agrees-to-up-to-500m-batterygate-settlement/">agreed to pay up to &#36;500 million</a> to settle a class action lawsuit in the U.S. that accused the company of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2017/12/18/geekbench-iphone-6s-slowdowns/">"secretly throttling" some iPhone models</a>, and payouts finally started going out this week to individuals who submitted a claim.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/iPhone-6s-MacRumors-YouTube.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="895" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-929156" /><br/>
The <a href="https://www.smartphoneperformancesettlement.com/">website for the so-called "batterygate" settlement</a> said payments would likely start to be distributed this January, and payouts have began on schedule. <em>MacRumors</em> readers Ken Strand and Michael Burkhardt are among the individuals who have received payments of &#36;92.17 per claim from Apple as part of the settlement.<br/>
<br/>
The lawsuit was filed <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2017/12/21/apple-lawsuit-slowing-down-old-iphone-models/">in December 2017</a>, shortly after Apple revealed that it throttled the maximum performance of some iPhone models with "chemically aged" batteries when necessary to prevent the devices from unexpectedly shutting down. Apple introduced this power management system in iOS 10.2.1, but it initially failed to mention the change in that update's release notes. <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2017/12/28/apple-iphone-battery-performance-price-drop/">Apple apologized</a> about its lack of transparency, and temporarily lowered the price of iPhone battery replacements to &#36;29 in 2018.<br/>
<br/>
Despite apologizing over the way it communicated the change, Apple repeatedly denied all allegations and never admitted to any legal wrongdoing. Apple said it agreed to the settlement only to "avoid burdensome and costly litigation."<br/>
<br/>
The class included any U.S. resident who owned an affected iPhone 6, iPhone 6 Plus, iPhone 6s, iPhone 6s Plus, and/or iPhone SE that ran iOS 10.2.1 or later, and/or an iPhone 7 or iPhone 7 Plus that ran iOS 11.2 or later, before December 21, 2017. The deadline to submit a claim for a payment was in October 2020.<br/>
<br/>
Apple continues to have a performance management system <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208387">on the iPhone 6 and newer</a>.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Happy New Year! 2024 is shaping up to be a big year for Apple, with its Vision Pro headset perhaps being the first big launch of the year in just a few weeks' time if the latest rumors are accurate.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/top-stories-6jan2024.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-929036" /><br/>
This week also saw an issue with a new iOS 17.3 beta that forced Apple to temporarily pull the update, the latest rumors on not only this year's iPhone 16 lineup but also next year's iPhone 17, and more, so read on below for all the details!<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Vision Pro Rumored to Launch in Final Week of January</h2><br/>
Apple's long-awaited Vision Pro headset <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/02/vision-pro-could-launch-in-last-week-of-january/">could launch in the U.S. around Friday, January 26,</a> according to a sketchy rumor from a Chinese investor news service. Apple promised that the headset would launch in early 2024, but it did not provide a specific timeframe.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/Apple-Vision-Pro-with-battery-Feature-Blue-Magenta.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-898550" /><br/>
<em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman said he has also heard the January 26 date floating around, and he reiterated that the Vision Pro will have a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/20/vision-pro-february-launch/">retail launch by February</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Apple Pulls iOS 17.3 Beta 2 Due to Boot Loop Issue</h2><br/>
Apple made the second beta of iOS 17.3 available to developers for testing earlier this week, but it <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/03/apple-pulls-ios-17-3-beta-2/">quickly pulled the software</a> after some iPhone users who installed it experienced a boot loop issue.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/iOS-17.3-Buggy-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-928685" /><br/>
As of writing, Apple has yet to re-release the second beta of iOS 17.3, but it has released the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/04/apple-releases-macos-sonoma-14-3-public-beta-2/">second public betas of macOS 14.3</a> and watchOS 10.3.<br/>
<br/>
iOS 17.3 includes a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/12/ios-17-3-stolen-device-protection-feature/">new Stolen Device Protection feature</a> and re-enables <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/13/ios-17-3-collaborative-playlist-emoji/">collaborative Apple Music playlists</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Apple Just Broke a Tradition It Held for 12 Years</h2><br/>
2023 was the first calendar year with no new iPads released since the original iPad was released in 2010, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/01/apple-just-broke-a-tradition-it-held-for-12-years/">marking the end of a 12-year tradition</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2018/11/ipad-pro-2022.jpg" alt="" width="1960" height="1102" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-870798" /><br/>
Apple is expected to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/05/all-ipads-expected-to-be-updated-in-2024/">update the entire iPad lineup throughout 2024</a>, including the iPad Pro, iPad Air, iPad mini, and the entry-level iPad. The next Pro models are widely rumored to feature OLED displays, and faster chips are expected for all models.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Here's What the iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max Will Look Like</h2><br/>
This year's iPhone 16 lineup is still moving through the development phases, but we have the latest information on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/04/iphone-16-pro-design/">what the next-generation Pro models currently look like</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/iPhone-16-Pro-Perspective-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-928694" /><br/>
Along with slightly larger displays, there's a new Capture button on the right side for quickly taking video, while the Action button appears to have the same design as on the current iPhone 15 Pro models even though Apple had been experimenting with making some changes to it.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Kuo: iPhone 17 to Feature 24MP Front-Facing Camera</h2><br/>
While the iPhone 16 lineup is still over eight months away, rumors are already circulating about the iPhone 17 lineup coming in 2025.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/03/dynamic-island.jpeg" alt="" width="1244" height="706" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-889703" /><br/>
According to Apple supply chain analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/04/kuo-iphone-17-to-feature-24mp-front-facing-camera/">iPhone 17's front camera will feature a 24-megapixel sensor</a>, up from a 12-megapixel sensor on current iPhones. He said this upgrade will significantly improve the front camera's image quality.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Apple Still Selling These Old and Often Forgotten Products</h2><br/>
While the majority of Apple's product lineup has been updated over the past few years, there are a handful of devices and accessories that are quite old.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[The United States Justice Department is in the "late stages" of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/02/15/doj-ramping-up-apple-antitrust-probe/">an antitrust investigation</a> into Apple that could soon lead to an antitrust lawsuit, reports <em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/05/technology/antitrust-apple-lawsuit-us.html">The New York Times</a></em>. The DoJ could be ready to file a "sweeping" antitrust case in the first half of 2024, with the agency considering how Apple's control over hardware and software locks consumers into the Apple ecosystem and makes it difficult for rivals to compete.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/05/iphone-15-sizes.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-912524" /><br/>
Apple officials have met with the DoJ several times during the investigation, which has covered everything from iMessage to the Apple Watch. Some of the topics looked at:<br/>
<ul><br/>
 	<li>How the Apple Watch works better with <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> than other smart watches do.</li><br/>
 	<li>How Apple locks competitors out of iMessage.</li><br/>
 	<li>How Apple blocks other financial firms from offering tap-to-pay services similar to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-pay/">Apple Pay</a> on the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;.</li><br/>
 	<li>Whether Apple favors its own apps and services over those provided by third-party developers.</li><br/>
 	<li>How Apple has blocked cloud gaming apps from the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a>.</li><br/>
 	<li>How Apple restricts the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;'s location services from devices that compete with <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airtags/">AirTag</a>.</li><br/>
 	<li>How App Tracking Transparency impacted the collection of advertising data.</li><br/>
 	<li>In-app purchase fees collected by Apple.</li><br/>
</ul><br/>
Apple competitors like Tile, Beeper, Basecamp, Meta, and Spotify have talked with antitrust investigators, as have banks that have wanted access to the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;'s NFC capabilities.<br/>
<br/>
The Department of Justice has not yet made a final decision about whether a lawsuit should be filed, and Apple has not yet had a chance to have a final meeting to plead its case before a lawsuit is filed.<br/>
<br/>
Apple and Microsoft are the only "big five" companies not currently facing U.S. lawsuits over their business practices. Google, Amazon, and Meta are all facing off against the DoJ or the FTC.<br/>
<br/>
Over the last several years, Apple has defended itself against antitrust accusations in the U.S. <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2020/10/06/apple-disagrees-antitrust-report/">In 2020</a>, the U.S. House Judiciary Antitrust Subcommittee said that Apple, Meta, Google, and Amazon have the "kinds of monopolies" last seen in "the era of oil barons and railroad tycoons."<br/>
<br/>
Apple has argued that it does not have a dominant market share in any category where it does business, and the company also often cites the opportunities and jobs provided by the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj;. If the DoJ does opt to file an antitrust lawsuit, it will likely lead to a multi-year legal battle.<br/>
<br/>
Though Apple has so far avoided regulatory action in the United States, it has been struggling against antitrust rules put in place in the European Union. The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/06/app-store-safari-and-ios-designated-gatekeepers/">Digital Markets Act (DMA)</a> could soon force Apple to make significant chances to the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj;, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a>, Messages, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/facetime/">FaceTime</a>, and other services. Apple is, for example, already working to add <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/17/app-sideloading-support-coming-ios-17/">support for sideloading apps</a> to iPhones in Europe, functionality that we are expecting to see sometime later this year.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/doj/">DOJ</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/antitrust/">Apple Antitrust</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/05/apple-us-antitrust-investigation-final-stages/">Apple Could Soon Face &#039;Sweeping&#039; U.S. Antitrust Lawsuit</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-could-soon-face-sweeping-u-s-antitrust-lawsuit.2415562/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

2024 is shaping up to be a very busy year for Apple, likely kicking off with the launch of the Vision Pro headset around February. <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/oled-ipad-pro/">Redesigned iPad Pro models</a> with larger display and OLED technology, the M3 chip, and new accessories are expected to follow in March, as well as next-generation <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/">iPad Air</a> models with a new, 12.9-inch size option. watchOS 11, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a>, iPadOS 18, macOS 15, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/visionos/">visionOS</a> 2, and tvOS 18 will likely be previewed in June at WWDC, potentially alongside the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/05/m3-ultra-mac-studio-to-launch-in-mid-2024/">M3 Ultra Mac Studio</a>. A refreshed <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a> 4K with a faster chip could also launch in the first half of the year.<br/>
<br/>
<ul><li><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-what-to-expect-2024/">What to Expect From Apple in 2024: Vision Pro, iPhone 16 Models, Revamped iPad Pro and More</a></li></ul><br/>
<br/>
September will likely see the introduction of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a>, featuring Spatial Video capture and the Action button, and the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/">iPhone 16 Pro</a>, touting larger displays, a 48-megapixel Ultra Wide camera, and a new "Capture button." The "<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-watch-x/">Apple Watch X</a>," fourth-generation AirPods, and refreshed <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-max/">AirPods Max</a> with USB-C are also expected to emerge around September.<br/>
<br/>
Apple could close out the year with the seventh-generation <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-mini/">iPad mini</a>, the 11th-generation <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>, and a new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-mini/">Mac mini</a> with the M3 and M3 Pro chips. We could also see new MacBook Pros with M4 series chips, but the timing of these devices is more unclear.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Following the Apple Card savings account's recent <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/04/apple-card-savings-account-apr-increase/">rate increase to 4.35%</a>, we have put together this guide comparing the annual percentage yields (APYs) of some popular high-yield savings accounts (HYSAs) available to U.S. residents.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/apple-card-savings-account-feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-928948" /><br/>
Apple's rate now matches that of popular HYSAs offered by the likes of American Express, Capital One, and Discover, but there are a handful of other options that offer even higher APYs in the 4.5% to low 5% range, such as Marcus by Goldman Sachs and Wealthfront. Balance limits and other requirements vary.<br/>
<br/>
There are many other HYSAs not listed in our chart, so be sure to do your research before deciding which option is best suited for you.<br/>

</table><br/>
<div class="clear"></div>* Advertised APYs as of January 5, 2024. APYs may vary.<br/>
<br/>
Ordinary savings accounts at popular banks such as Bank of America and Chase typically offer APYs of only 0.01% or slightly higher.<br/>
<br/>
Apple launched its savings account <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/17/apple-card-savings-account-launching-today/">in April 2023</a>, in partnership with Goldman Sachs. The account can be opened and managed in the Wallet app on the iPhone, and it has no fees, no minimum deposits, and no minimum balance requirements. You must have an Apple Card, be a U.S. resident, and be at least 18 years old to open an account.<br/>
<br/>
The account allows Apple Card holders to earn interest on their Daily Cash cashback balance, and on funds deposited via a linked bank account or an Apple Cash balance. The maximum balance allowed is &#36;250,000, which is lower than some HYSAs, and balances are fully insured by the U.S. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC).<br/>
<br/>
To open a savings account in the Wallet app, tap on your Apple Card, tap on the circle with three dots at the top of the screen, tap Daily Cash, and select Set Up Savings.<br/>
<br/>
Goldman Sachs will reportedly be <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/28/apple-goldman-sachs-partnership-ending/">ending its partnership with Apple</a> within the next year or so, but it is unclear how this might impact the Apple Card.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-card/">Apple Card</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/05/apple-card-savings-rate-comparison-hysas/">Here&#039;s How the Apple Card&#039;s New Savings Rate Compares to Alternatives</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/heres-how-the-apple-cards-new-savings-rate-compares-to-alternatives.2415537/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple CEO <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tim-cook/">Tim Cook</a> will meet the European Union's antitrust chief, Margrethe Vestager, next week amid a series of disputes with the organization (via <em><a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/eus-vestager-meet-big-tech-ceos-us-next-week-2024-01-05/">Reuters</a></em>).<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2018/10/tim-cook-europe-privacy.jpg" alt="" width="712" height="394" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-662071" /><br/>
Vestager is also set to meet the chief executives of Alphabet, Broadcom, and Nvidia, as well as senior executives from OpenAI. The meetings will take place in San Francisco and Palo Alto on Thursday and Friday next week, and will focus on European competition policy and digital regulation.<br/>
<br/>
In December, Apple reportedly floated the ability for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-pay/">Apple Pay</a> rivals to access the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>'s NFC technology for contactless payments in the EU. The offer is designed to settle an ongoing antitrust dispute and avoid a potential fine. The European Commission is believed to be seeking feedback from rivals and customers before accepting the offer, so it is highly likely that this matter will be discussed.<br/>
<br/>
Apple is also facing several other challenges in the EU that will almost certainly be the subject of discussion, such as a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/09/apple-could-pay-ireland-eu-tax-dispute/">&#36;14 billion tax dispute</a>. Most strikingly, new EU rules such as the Digital Markets Act (DMA) designate major tech companies as "<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/06/app-store-safari-and-ios-designated-gatekeepers/">gatekeepers</a>" and compel them to open up their various services and platforms to other companies and developers. The DMA is expected to force Apple to make significant changes to the way the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/facetime/">FaceTime</a>, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a> work in Europe.

		<description><![CDATA[Apple will be reopening its <a href="https://www.apple.com/retail/baystreet/">Bay Street retail store</a> in Emeryville, California on Monday, January 8 at 10 a.m. local time, according to the company's website.<br/>
<br/>

The store had been closed for renovations since early September, according to <a href="https://michaelsteeber.substack.com/p/clearing-the-table"><em>Tabletops</em></a>, a weekly newsletter about Apple retail published by <a href="https://departmentmap.store/">Michael Steeber</a>. However, it is currently unclear if the store will have any public-facing changes when it reopens, or if the renovations are limited to the backroom area for staff members.<br/>
<br/>
The store originally opened in 2002, becoming Apple's 50th retail location in the U.S., and moved to its current location on Bay Street in 2016.<br/>
<br/>
Steeber recently released a major update for <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/facades/id6443868157">Facades</a>, an app that provides comprehensive information about Apple's retail stores around the world.

		<description><![CDATA[A new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-studio/">Mac Studio</a> model with the M3 Ultra chip—which could be more powerful than expected—will launch in mid-2024, according to a new report.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/M3-Mac-Pro-and-Studio-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-920519" /><br/>
The report comes from Taiwanese research firm <a href="https://www.trendforce.com/news/2024/01/04/news-tsmc-reportedly-attracts-influx-of-3nm-customers-predicts-production-capacity-utilization-to-surge-to-80-by-year-end/">TrendForce</a> citing <a href="https://www.icsmart.cn/72181/"><em>ICsmart</em></a>. The current &zwnj;Mac Studio&zwnj;, which contains <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m2/">M2</a> Max and &zwnj;M2&zwnj; Ultra chip options, was introduced at WWDC in June 2023. With TrendForce forecasting another mid-year update for the &zwnj;Mac Studio&zwnj;, a repeat appearance at WWDC seems likely this year.<br/>
<br/>
The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-pro/">Mac Pro</a> is the only other Mac model that contains an "Ultra" Apple silicon chip, so its absence from today's report discussing the M3 Ultra is noticeable. While, logically, the &zwnj;Mac Pro&zwnj; should receive an update to add the M3 Ultra chip alongside the &zwnj;Mac Studio&zwnj;, just like it received the &zwnj;M2&zwnj; Ultra chip last year, there have been no rumors to suggest this will be the case again this year as of yet.<br/>
<br/>
Interestingly, TrendForce claims that the M3 Ultra chip will be fabricated with TSMC's N3E node, just like the A18 chip that is expected to debut in the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a> lineup later in the year. This means it would be Apple's first N3E chip. The M3, M3 Pro, and M3 Max chips are fabricated with TSMC's N3B process, just like the A17 Pro. N3E is an enhanced version of TSMC's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/3nm/">3nm</a> process, offering slightly better performance and higher production yield. <br/>
<br/>
It would be somewhat odd for Apple to make the M3 Ultra its first N3E chip, since Apple's "Ultra" chips comprise two "Max" chips linked via its UltraFusion chip interconnect technology, meaning that an N3E M3 Ultra would effectively be two M4 Max chips. To date, each generation of Apple's custom silicon chips have used the same fabrication process across the lineup, since the chip architecture is simply scaled up. Using different nodes in the same family of chips, especially on the "Ultra" chip variant, would be an unprecedented move.<br/>
<br/>
The only explanation if Apple does opt for this route would be that the company plans to introduce the M4, M4 Pro, and M4 Max chips sooner rather than later, perhaps in late 2024, and would want to ensure that the M3 Ultra &zwnj;Mac Studio&zwnj; remains competitive with the newer chips. Even so, in this instance, it would surely be more straightforward to brand the chip "M4 Ultra" and skip the M3 Ultra entirely. <br/>
<br/>
As a result, this part of the report should be treated with some skepticism. Nevertheless, a mid-year time frame for the launch of a new &zwnj;Mac Studio&zwnj; seems likely. <br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today increased the Apple Card savings account's APY to 4.35%, according to a notification sent to cardholders, including <em>MacRumors</em> contributor <a href="https://twitter.com/aaronp613">Aaron Perris</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/04/apple-card-savings-account-16x9.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-892213" /><br/>
This is the second increase to the savings account's APY in as many months, after Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/20/apple-savings-4-25-interest-rate/">raised it from 4.15% to 4.25% in December</a>. Apple's rate now matches that offered by popular high-yield savings accounts from American Express and Discover, but there are still some other options that offer even higher APYs up into the 4.5% to low 5% range in the U.S., such as Marcus by Goldman Sachs and Wealthfront.<br/>
<br/>
Apple launched the high-yield savings account <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/17/apple-card-savings-account-launching-today/">in April 2023</a>, in partnership with Goldman Sachs. The account can be opened and managed in the Wallet app on the iPhone, and it has no fees, no minimum deposits, and no minimum balance requirements. You must have an Apple Card, be a U.S. resident, and be at least 18 years old to open an account.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/4.35-Apple-Card-Savings.jpg" alt="" width="1179" height="320" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-928919" /><br/>
The account allows Apple Card holders to earn interest on their Daily Cash cashback balance, and on personal funds deposited via a linked bank account, or from their Apple Cash balance. The maximum balance allowed is &#36;250,000, and balances are fully insured by the U.S. government's Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.<br/>
<br/>
The rate increase comes after <em>The Wall Street Journal</em> in November reported that Goldman Sachs is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/28/apple-goldman-sachs-partnership-ending/">looking to terminate its Apple Card partnership</a>, as part of its broader exit from the consumer lending business. The partnership is expected to end within the next year or so, but it's unclear how this might affect the Apple Card in the future.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-card/">Apple Card</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/04/apple-card-savings-account-apr-increase/">Apple Card Savings Account Receives Another Rate Increase</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-card-savings-account-receives-another-rate-increase.2415503/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[BlackBerry fans that miss having a physical keyboard on their smartphones may want to <a href="https://www.clicks.tech">check out Clicks</a>, a company that has developed a keyboard case that's designed for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-14/">iPhone 14</a> Pro and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a> models.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/clicks-keyboard-for-iphone.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-928870" /><br/>
Clicks is showing off its keyboard accessories ahead of CES, and the &zwnj;iPhone 14&zwnj; Pro version of its keyboard will be ready to ship out in February. The keyboard is priced at &#36;139, with an &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; version coming in mid-March and a &#36;159 &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; Max version set to release in the spring.<br/>
<br/>
The Clicks Creator Keyboard is available in "BumbleBee" yellow and "London Sky" gray, and it adds a small physical keyboard to the bottom of an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>. Clicks says that the case design is meant to "feel like a natural extension" of the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;, and the keys have been designed for ideal click resistance and feedback for fast and accurate typing.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/clicks-keyboard-3.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1124" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-928871" /><br/>
The standard QWERTY keyboard features keys for activating dictation, accessing emoji, and activating shortcuts like returning to the Home screen and scrolling. At night, a built-in backlight can be turned on.<br/>
<br/>
An &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; connects to the keyboard via Lightning (&zwnj;iPhone 14&zwnj; Pro) or USB-C (&zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj;), and passthrough charging is supported. The case also supports wireless charging capabilities, though it does not have <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe-battery-pack/">MagSafe</a>.<br/>
<br/>
The &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; version of the Clicks keyboard measures in at 188.45mm, so it is 41.85mm longer than the 146.6mm &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj;. That is equivalent to 1.65 inches, so expect an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; equipped with this keyboard to be over an inch and a half longer. It's a little over 3mm wider than the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;, and 2.50mm thicker. The case weighs in at 62 grams, a little under half of the 187 gram weight of the &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/clicks-keyboard-gray-color.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-928872" /><br/>
Dimensions are similar for the &zwnj;iPhone 14&zwnj; Pro and &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; Max models, so the keyboards do add some considerable bulk to the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;. Clicks says that the keyboard is easy to put on and remove, and while in use, it does serve as a hardware-based keyboard, so you won't see the software keyboard on the display.<br/>
<br/>
Clicks for &zwnj;iPhone 14&zwnj; Pro and &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; <a href="https://www.clicks.tech">can be pre-ordered from the Clicks website</a>, while the &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; Max version can be reserved for &#36;30.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/04/clicks-iphone-keyboard/">Miss Physical Keyboards?

		<description><![CDATA[<em>MacRumors</em> recently received new information on Apple's 2024 <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> lineup, including a look at prototypes of the Pro devices. We've created a series of mockups based on Apple's internal designs, and while the prototypes are not quite finalized, our images represent the clearest look yet of what we can expect from the next-generation iPhones at this point in time.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/iPhone-16-Pro-Perspective-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-928694" /><br/>
<br/>
Building on the curved edges and titanium frame that Apple introduced with the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a>, the next-generation <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/">iPhone 16 Pro</a> and &zwnj;iPhone 16 Pro&zwnj; Max are set to feature increased display sizes and a new capacitive Capture button.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/iPhone-16-Pro-Front-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-928695" /><br/>
<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/29/iphone-16-preliminary-weights-dimensions/">As reported by multiple sources</a>, the &zwnj;iPhone 16 Pro&zwnj; (codename Diablo) and &zwnj;iPhone 16 Pro&zwnj; Max (codename Lightning) will have larger displays, measuring in at 6.3 inches and 6.9 inches, up from 6.1 inches and 6.7 inches. One possible explanation for this change has to do with the 5x tetraprism Telephoto camera, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/20/tetraprism-lens-iphone-16-pro/">which is expected to be available on both Pro iPhone models this year</a>. With the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a> lineup, only the larger &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; Max includes the 5x Telephoto lens, while the smaller &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; does not. The increased size of this year's devices will give Apple the space to add the tetraprism Telephoto camera to both &zwnj;iPhone 16 Pro&zwnj; and 16 Pro Max.<br/>
<br/>
While the overall form factor and general design of the &zwnj;iPhone 16 Pro&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPhone 16 Pro&zwnj; Max have remained consistent through Apple's development phase, the company has experimented with different design details for the devices. There were four total button configurations that were tested, and Apple appears to have settled on a button design similar to the one on the &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj;, though with an added button on the right side of the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/iPhone-16-Pro-Left-Side-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-928696" /><br/>
As with the &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; Max, both Pro models in the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a> range will be equipped with a multi-purpose Action button. The button can be configured to perform a range of functions, depending on the user's preference. While Apple has experimented with larger sizes and different designs for the Action button, current design documentation suggests that the Action button will be the same size as the one found on the current &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/30/iphone-16-action-button-all-models/">An earlier Action button design</a>, developed under the codename Atlas, was envisioned as a larger capacitive button with a force sensor. Given that the most recent designs for the &zwnj;iPhone 16 Pro&zwnj; and Pro Max do not feature this bigger Action button, the future of the Atlas project remains unclear, and it is possible that Apple canceled the Atlas project in favor of a standard mechanical Action button.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/31/iphone-16-extra-button-rumor/">Weibo leaker "Instant Digital" claimed</a> in October that the &zwnj;iPhone 16 Pro&zwnj; would feature an Action button that lies flush with the frame of the device. Although internal documentation seen by <em>MacRumors</em> corroborates this claim, it was a feature of the earlier "Proto1" development stage. With the current "Proto2" design that we've seen, the Action button is no longer flush with the frame, and is no longer as large.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/iPhone-16-Pro-Right-Side-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-928697" /><br/>
On the right side, the &zwnj;iPhone 16 Pro&zwnj; models feature an all-new Capture button, which we <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/12/early-iphone-16-prototypes/">showed off in our December renders</a> of the standard &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; models. The Capture button, developed under the codename Nova, is expected to be a capacitive-type button with force-sensor functionality, and <em>Bloomberg</em>'s <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a> recently confirmed that it will be <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/17/iphone-16-capture-button-video/">used for taking video</a>. It is located below the power button, which means that on U.S. models, Apple is relocating the mmWave antenna from the right side of the device to the left side. The Capture button will be flush with the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;'s frame and it will not protrude like the power and volume buttons.<br/>
<br/>
In terms of materials, the &zwnj;iPhone 16 Pro&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPhone 16 Pro&zwnj; Max will continue to use the same <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/11/iphone-15-pro-grade-5-titanium/">Grade 5 Titanium (Ti-6Al-4V) used for the iPhone 15 Pro</a>, with no significant changes to the overall finish. As far as colors are concerned, Apple's prototypes use a "Silver" color, which is marketed by Apple as "White Titanium." Documentation suggests that Apple has so far used the existing colors from the &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; and Pro Max for testing purposes, with plans to add another color option. Unfortunately, there are no details on the new color option at this time.<br/>
<br/>
While the mockups we've created accurately portray the current design of the &zwnj;iPhone 16 Pro&zwnj; and Pro Max, changes are always possible as the devices are still in an early stage of development and Apple may make further design tweaks. <br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Over the past few months, some users have been unable to sync their Apple Music library between their iPhone and Mac, seemingly due to a bug.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/08/iOS-17-Apple-Music-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2250" height="1266" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-907547" /><br/>
Affected users receive the following error message in the Music app on the Mac:<blockquote>Genius results can't be updated right now. An unknown error occurred (18004).</blockquote>There are complaints about the issue across the <a href="https://discussions.apple.com/thread/255233822?sortBy=best">Apple Support Community</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-music-library-no-longer-works.2415038/">MacRumors Forums</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AppleMusic/comments/18yacfb/apple_music_library_is_completely_broken/">Reddit</a>, and elsewhere on the internet.<br/>
<br/>
The underlying cause of the issue is unclear, and it's not entirely clear if a fix will require software updates, or if Apple can implement a server-side fix. We've reached out to Apple for comment, and we'll update this story if we receive a response.<br/>
<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today seeded the second public beta of an upcoming <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sonoma/">macOS Sonoma</a> 14.3 update, allowing non-developers to test out the software ahead of its release. The second public beta comes three weeks after <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/14/apple-seeds-macos-sonoma-14-3-public-beta-1/">the first public beta</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-900182" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/macos-sonoma-4.jpg" alt="" width="2336" height="1314" /><br/>
Beta testers can opt-in through the Software Update section of the System Settings app. Under Beta updates, simply toggle on the Sonoma Public Beta. Note that you must sign up to participate on Apple's <a href="https://beta.apple.com">beta testing website</a>.<br/>
<br/>
&zwnj;macOS Sonoma&zwnj; 14.3 includes support for collaborative playlists in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/">Apple Music</a>, allowing &zwnj;Apple Music&zwnj; subscribers to build playlists with others. When creating a new playlist or selecting an existing playlist, there's a person-shaped icon that can be tapped to turn on collaboration.<br/>
<br/>
Enabling collaboration provides a link that can be shared with others, and anyone with the link is able to contribute to the playlist and listen to the songs. The person who started the playlist can choose to approve those who want to join or open it up to everyone. Anyone with the link to a playlist can add music, though the owner can turn off collaboration at any time or remove people.<br/>
<br/>
&zwnj;macOS Sonoma&zwnj; 14.3 is expected to see a launch at some point in January 2024. Apple has also released public betas of watchOS 10.3 and new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod/">HomePod</a> 17.3 software. <div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sonoma/">macOS Sonoma</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macos-sonoma.243">macOS Sonoma</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/04/apple-releases-macos-sonoma-14-3-public-beta-2/">Apple Seeds Second Public Beta of macOS Sonoma 14.3</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-seeds-second-public-beta-of-macos-sonoma-14-3.2415463/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

It is not unusual that iOS 17.2 is no longer being signed. Apple routinely stops signing older versions of iOS after new releases in order to encourage customers to keep their operating systems up to date and to prevent users from downgrading to older, less secure versions of the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; operating system.<br/>
<br/>
The iOS 17.2 update brought the Journal app, spatial video recording on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a> models, updates to Messages and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/">Apple Music</a>, and more. Apple did not ever provide details on the bug fixes included in iOS 17.2.1.<br/>
<br/>
Apple is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ios-17-3-beta-features/">already testing iOS 17.3</a>, an update that is expected to come out later in January.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/04/apple-stops-signing-ios-17-2/">Apple Stops Signing iOS 17.2, Downgrading No Longer Possible</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-stops-signing-ios-17-2-downgrading-no-longer-possible.2415462/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Samsung this week announced its 2024 Unpacked event, which is set to be held on January 17 in San Jose, California. Samsung is expected to introduce its S24 line of Galaxy smartphones, which will directly compete with Apple's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a> lineup.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe title="[Invitation] Galaxy Unpacked 2024: Opening a New Era of Mobile AI" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wRAwejsqW6A" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div><br/>
Samsung's event announcement teases a "new era of mobile AI," so it's safe to say that Samsung's new smartphones will have enhanced AI capabilities on par with ChatGPT and other AI products. In fact, Samsung says that the new Galaxy S series will feature the "most intelligent mobile experience yet."<br/>
<br/>
Galaxy S24 rumors have suggested that the high-end Ultra model will include a 200-megapixel <a href="https://twitter.com/universeice/status/1736910942318084347">AI-enhanced camera</a> that is able to identify 12 kinds of objects and optimize them for improved image quality. The AI could also be used to translate messages to more than a dozen languages in real time.<br/>
<br/>
The S24 Ultra is also expected to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/1/23984653/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-plus-leaks-rumors-snapdragon-ai">feature a flatter screen design</a> with a more square shape, and it appears that Samsung is going to transition to a titanium frame, mimicking an Apple design decision for the &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj;. Samsung is expected to offer the S24 Ultra in black, gray, violet, and yellow titanium shades.<br/>
<br/>
Other Ultra rumors include a 50-megapixel 5x telephoto lens, which is a downgrade from the prior 10x telephoto lens, and Wi-Fi 7 support. The S24 and S24 Plus are expected to be largely similar to the S23 models, though there will be new color options and lager 6.7 and 6.2-inch displays.<br/>
<br/>
Samsung's event will take place on January 17 at 10:00 a.m. Pacific Time, and customers who plan to pre-order <a href="https://howl.me/cllVxphW5r6">can reserve a device</a> and receive a &#36;50 Samsung credit. The reservation system does not charge automatically, requiring only a name and an email address to reserve devices. Credits will be able to be redeemed when pre-ordering after the devices debut.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[It's been a few months since Apple accessory maker Pad & Quill <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/24/pad-quill-shutting-down/">announced</a> the closure of its business, ending a 13 year run as a creator of leather accessories for Apple products. This week, former Pad & Quill president Brian Holmes has announced his new venture, <a href="https://burtongoods.com?sca_ref=5180275.Ywgd2BL872">Burton Goods</a>, and it has a 20 percent off grand opening discount.<br/>

<br/>
Holmes detailed everything that happened from the closure of Pad & Quill to the founding of Burton Goods <a href="https://burtongoods.com/blogs/news/what-happened-to-pq">in a blog post</a>. Burton Goods will follow in Pad & Quill's footsteps in many ways, focusing on high-quality leather accessories for iPhone and iPad, leather bags for tech enthusiasts, and more.<br/>
