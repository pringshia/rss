		<description><![CDATA[Apple today made three changes to its <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/102772">vintage and obsolete products list</a>, involving the iPhone 5s, sixth-generation iPod touch, and an older iMac model.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/iPhone-5s-16x9.jpeg" alt="" width="1280" height="720" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-952997" /><br/>
First, Apple now considers the iPhone 5s to be an "obsolete" product worldwide, meaning that Apple Stores and Apple Authorized Service Providers no longer offer repairs or other hardware service for the device. Apple says it considers a product "obsolete" once seven years have passed since the company last distributed it for sale.<br/>
<br/>
Apple released the iPhone 5s in September 2013, with its key new feature being the Touch ID fingerprint sensor built into the Home button. The device also introduced the A7 chip, which was Apple's first iPhone chip with 64-bit architecture.<br/>
<br/>
Second, the sixth-generation iPod touch and the late 2015 edition of the 21.5-inch iMac with a Retina 4K display are now classified as "vintage" products, as more than five years have passed since the company stopped distributing the devices for sale. Apple Stores and Apple Authorized Service Providers can continue to offer repairs for vintage products for up to two more years, but only if the necessary parts remain available.<br/>
<br/>
The sixth-generation iPod touch was released in 2015, and it was the second-last model of the device. Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/05/10/apple-discontinues-ipod-touch/">discontinued the iPod touch line</a> in 2022.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/vintage-and-obsolete/">Vintage and Obsolete Apple Products</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/31/apple-says-iphone-5s-now-obsolete/">Apple Says iPhone 5s Now Obsolete as iPod Touch 6 Becomes &#039;Vintage&#039;</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-says-iphone-5s-now-obsolete-as-ipod-touch-6-becomes-vintage.2427839/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[For this week's giveaway, we've teamed up with <a href="https://gridstudio.cc">GRID Studio</a> to offer <em>MacRumors</em> readers a chance to win an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a>. For those unfamiliar with GRID Studio, it is a small company that crafts art out of old, discarded Apple products.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/grid_frame_studio_1st_iphone_10.jpg" alt="" width="1400" height="788" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-952967" /><br/>
GRID Studio buys and recycles old electronics, taking them apart and arranging each component carefully under a glass frame. Their work turns a hodgepodge of parts into display pieces designed for Apple enthusiasts who want to own a piece of Apple's history.<br/>
<br/>
The &#36;400 <a href="https://gridstudio.cc/products/iphone-1st-generation">GRID 1</a> is perhaps GRID Studio's most iconic offering, featuring the original Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> from 2007. The GRID 1 includes all of the components of the first &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;, complete with labeling and interesting facts like all of GRID's pieces. The original &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;'s unmistakable housing is displayed next to the button, headphone socket, speaker, logic board, ear piece, and other components, and it's particularly interesting because it was before the days when Apple started making its own chips.<br/>
<br/>
The <a href="https://gridstudio.cc/products/grid%C2%AE4s">GRID 4S</a> is an affordable way to get a piece of GRID Studio's art, as it's on sale for &#36;99 this week. The GRID 4S was the final &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; that was introduced while Steve Jobs was still alive, and the first &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tim-cook/">Tim Cook</a> launched without Jobs. The "S" stood for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a>, and it was the first &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; that included the &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; personal assistant.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/grid-studio-iphone-4S.jpg" alt="" width="2959" height="1664" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-952965" /><br/>
For Mac fans, the &#36;600 <a href="https://gridstudio.cc/products/grid-macbook-air-1st-generation">GRID MacBook Air</a> showcases the first-generation <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/">MacBook Air</a> that Apple released, and it is one of GRID Studio's larger pieces at 30 inches by 18.5 inches. At the time, the 2008 &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; was marketed world's thinnest notebook computer, and it is definitely one of Apple's most well-known later-stage Macs.<br/>
<br/>
The GRID &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; has the machine's display at the top, followed by all of the interior components, and then the keyboard and trackpad combo. The hard drive, fan, network card, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe-battery-pack/">MagSafe</a> components are all neatly displayed, and it's a fun look at some vintage components that Apple has long since abandoned.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/grid-studio-macbook-air.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-952966" /><br/>

This includes new record low prices on the 10th generation iPad and M2 iPad Air, and a sale on the Apple Watch Ultra 2.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[On this week's episode of <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/podcast/new-ios-18-leaks-rumors-ahead-of-wwdc-2024/id1602394741?i=1000657420444">The MacRumors Show</a>, we discuss some of the latest rumors about <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a>, including deeper <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/home-screen/">Home Screen</a> customization, AI-generated emojis, and more.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/G6-3eNxaCNI?si=aH34d4pRK3bz5vAO" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@themacrumorsshow?sub_confirmation=1">Subscribe to The MacRumors Show YouTube channel</a> for more videos</em></div><br/>
With &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj;, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a> is expected to undergo a substantial overhaul with improved natural language processing, enabling more conversational interactions and proactive intelligence. The assistant will apparently understand and perform more complex tasks within apps. These tasks range from moving notes between folders and deleting emails to summarizing articles and recent notifications.<br/>
<br/>
Spotlight search will also allegedly see similar enhancements, integrating deeper with system-wide information to provide more intelligent and relevant results. In Messages, AI will suggest responses and create custom emojis based on message content. The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/photos/">Photos</a> app will incorporate AI-powered retouching tools and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/">Apple Music</a> will offer auto-generated playlists and smoother song transitions.<br/>
<br/>
&zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj; is also expected to introduce a more customizable &zwnj;Home Screen&zwnj;. Users will have the freedom to place app icons anywhere on the grid and change app icon colors.<br/>
<br/>
Safari is expected to gain an Intelligent Search option, summarizing key topics and phrases on web pages, and a new Web Eraser tool, which allows users to remove unwanted portions of websites. The Calculator app will be redesigned to include recent calculations and better unit conversion tools, becoming a universal app for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>, and Mac. <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-maps/">Apple Maps</a> will introduce custom routes and topographic maps, enhancing navigation and outdoor activities.<br/>
<br/>
Accessibility is another focus area for &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj; with new features like Eye Tracking, which uses the front-facing camera to navigate the interface, and Vehicle Motion Cues, designed to reduce motion sickness. Music Haptics will provide tactile feedback in sync with music, and Vocal Shortcuts will enable users to assign custom phrases for &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; to execute complex tasks.<br/>
<br/>
The adoption of the Rich Communication Services (<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/rcs/">RCS</a>) standard should improve messaging between iPhones and Android devices with support for higher resolution photos, audio messages, typing indicators, read receipts, and improved group chat functionality. <br/>
<br/>
&zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj; is expected to be compatible with all iPhones that support <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a>, including models as old as the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; XR and &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; XS. However, iPadOS 18 may drop support for older models such as the first-generation 10.5-inch <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a> and the second-generation 12.9-inch &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj;. <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/the-macrumors-show/">The MacRumors Show</a> has <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@themacrumorsshow">its own YouTube channel</a>, so make sure you're subscribed to keep up with new episodes and clips:<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple plans to add a new text effects feature to the Messages app on iOS 18, according to multiple sources familiar with the matter.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/07/General-Apps-Messages.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1407" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-808613" /><br/>
While it is already possible to send iMessages with bubble effects or full-screen effects, such as invisible ink or confetti, the text effects would allow you to animate individual words within a message. With the Messages app <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/16/apple-to-adopt-rcs-messaging-standard/">set to gain RCS support</a> on iOS 18, it is possible the text effects will also work with green bubbles.<br/>
<br/>
Our hope is that Apple will also add bold, italics, and underline formatting options alongside the text effects, but we have not confirmed that possibility.<br/>
<br/>
In addition to the text effects and RCS support, the Messages app on iOS 18 will reportedly gain an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/22/apple-generative-ai-features-and-smarter-siri/">AI-powered autocompletion tool</a>.<br/>
<br/>
As a refresher, RCS support will provide an improved messaging experience between iPhones and Android devices compared to the current SMS standard. Just like iMessage, RCS features higher-resolution photos and videos, audio messages, typing indicators, read receipts, the ability to send messages over a Wi-Fi network, and better functionality for group chats.<br/>
<br/>
iOS 18 is set to be unveiled during the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/28/wwdc-2024-full-schedule/">WWDC keynote on June 10</a>, and the first beta should be made available to members of the Apple Developer Program immediately after the presentation. The first public beta of iOS 18 will likely follow in July, and the update should be widely released to all users with a compatible iPhone in September.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[It's been just over two weeks since the M4 <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a> launched, which means it's time for a longer term review of the updated OLED display, AI-focused processor, super thin design, and new accessories that include the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-pencil/">Apple Pencil</a> Pro and Magic Keyboard.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qMjlq2XeWNQ?si=loJUAJ9xOnXbM2O8" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/macrumors?sub_confirmation=1">Subscribe to the MacRumors YouTube channel</a> for more videos.</em></div><br/>
The design of the new &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; is probably the best overall feature, and the drop in weight and thickness makes a difference whether you're traveling or just using the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> around the house. At 5.1mm, the 13-inch &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; is Apple's thinnest device to date, and a tablet of this size and thickness continues to be impressive. Two weeks on, there's no hint of a "bendgate" thanks to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/14/ipad-pro-structural-design-avoid-bendgate/">the reinforced rib</a> that Apple included under the hood. There's an argument to be made that some people would have preferred a bigger battery to a slimmer design, of course.<br/>
<br/>
Apple moved the front camera to the landscape side of the &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj;, and it's a small but notable change. If you use your &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; with a keyboard in landscape orientation but have had to awkwardly turn it to portrait mode for a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/facetime/">FaceTime</a> call, this is a tweak you'll appreciate. It's much more natural than treating the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; like a giant <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>.<br/>
<br/>
The &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj;'s OLED display has no competition. It is by far the best display that Apple has introduced in an &zwnj;iPad&zwnj;, and you won't find a better tablet display available from competing products, either. Apple used tandem OLED technology (basically stacking two OLED displays on top of each other), and the brightness and contrast are unparalleled. Movies look amazing, the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; does well in bright lighting, and the HDR makes images pop.<br/>
<br/>
Compared to the prior-generation &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; with mini-LED display, the OLED display is better, but not so much so that it's worth upgrading for that alone. Coming from an LCD, though, the difference is much more notable.<br/>
<br/>
The last &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; with an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m2/">M2</a> chip is incredibly fast, and the M4 is even quicker, based on benchmarks. You're not going to find much that's going to max out the M4 processor in day to day usage, but you'll see bigger numbers on benchmarking tests comparing the M4 &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; to the &zwnj;M2&zwnj; &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj;. Editing videos and creating songs in Final Cut Pro and Logic Pro is super fast with the M4, but it was also super fast with the &zwnj;M2&zwnj;. Maybe the M4 chip will shine when iPadOS 18 is updated with a slew of new AI features, but for now, it's overkill.<br/>
<br/>
Apple nixed both the Ultra Wide camera and mmWave 5G in this version of the &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj;, and most people probably won't miss these features. Whether a 13-inch tablet needs any kind of rear camera is up in the air, and mmWave 5G speeds are still fairly limited in availability. Sub 6GHz 5G remains, and that's plenty fast enough for downloads, watching streaming content, and playing games.<br/>
<br/>
As for accessories, the &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; Pro is basically the same as the &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; 2 but with a couple new tricks. You can squeeze to bring up menus so you don't need to go hunting for settings to do things like change line thickness or color, and there's a barrel roll feature that basically does things like vary line thickness when tilting the &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; so it behaves more like a real writing or drawing tool. <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/find-my-network-accessory-program/">Find My</a> might be the most useful addition so you can track down the &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; if it goes missing, and Haptic Feedback is also nice to have.<br/>
<br/>
The Magic Keyboard is way more Mac like thanks to that larger glass trackpad and the aluminum palm rest. The trackpad is more pleasant to use than before, and the function keys are also a big plus for controlling media, changing screen brightness, and more without having to dig into the Settings app or Control Center.<br/>
<br/>
Unsurprisingly, the &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; is without a doubt Apple's best &zwnj;iPad&zwnj;, and it's probably the best tablet on the market. The major downside is the price, with the 11-inch model starting at &#36;999 and the 13-inch model starting at &#36;1299. Those are Mac prices, and while the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj;'s hardware is worth it, it's a lot to pay for the limitations that you're stuck with when using iPadOS. There are workflows out there that work with a tablet, but many people aren't going to be able to replace a Mac with an &zwnj;iPad&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
You also have to shell out for the 1TB+ &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; if you want maximum performance, as the 1TB and 2TB models have an extra CPU core (10 cores vs. 9 cores) and 16GB RAM instead of 8GB.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPad-Pro">iPad Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/31/two-week-review-m4-ipad-pro/">Review: Two Weeks With the M4 iPad Pro</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/review-two-weeks-with-the-m4-ipad-pro.2427824/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The upcoming iOS 18 update for the iPhone will include unspecified "updates" to Control Center, according to <a href="https://x.com/markgurman/status/1796399911526920509"><em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman</a>.<br/>
<br/>

If that sounds familiar, it is because Control Center was rumored to be revamped on <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/04/07/ios-15-control-center-touch-id-rumor/">both iOS 15</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/05/ios-17-control-center-changes-rumor/">iOS 17</a>, but neither update ended up introducing any significant changes to the feature, which provides quick access to system functions like Wi-Fi, display brightness, volume, and more. However, both of those rumors proved to be from unreliable sources for Apple leaks, whereas Gurman is a more reputable source.<br/>
<br/>
<em>MacRumors</em> has learned that Apple has internally tested a redesigned Control Center for iOS 18, but we cannot confirm if these changes have been finalized.<br/>
<br/>
Apple will unveil iOS 18 during its <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/28/wwdc-2024-full-schedule/">WWDC keynote on June 10</a>, and the first beta should be made available to members of the Apple Developer Program immediately after the presentation. The first public beta of iOS 18 will likely follow in July, and the update should be widely released to all users with a compatible iPhone in September.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a></div><div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/control-center/">Control Center</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/31/ios-18-control-center-updates-rumor/">Gurman: iOS 18 to Feature &#039;Updates&#039; to Control Center</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/gurman-ios-18-to-feature-updates-to-control-center.2427819/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The international launch of Apple's Vision Pro headset could finally occur in July, just over six months after the device was released in the United States.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/Apple-Vision-Pro-Demo.jpeg" alt="" width="2880" height="1620" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-933882" /><br/>
A source familiar with the matter told <em>MacRumors</em> that the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a> is now scheduled to launch internationally in July. Separately, <em>MacRumors</em> is aware that some Apple Stores in the UK recently received large deliveries on pallets, believed to be couches designed for Vision Pro demos, that staff are not yet allowed to open. Apple Retail Managers in the UK have been told to begin the process of planning to transition the Avenues to facilitate Vision Pro accessories. Further refreshes of in-store visuals are also planned for July.<br/>
<br/>
The international launch of the Vision Pro is likely to fall in the third or fourth week of July. Given this timing, there is a chance that Apple will confirm the date at its WWDC keynote on June 10.<br/>
<br/>
This time frame is later than anticipated by many analysts, such as <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/">Ming-Chi Kuo</a>, who said that Apple was highly likely to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/16/vision-pro-to-launch-internationally-before-wwdc/">launch the Vision Pro internationally</a> before WWDC to drive interest in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/visionos/">visionOS</a> 2.

		<description><![CDATA[Apple is planning a major AI overhaul for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a> in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a>, and <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-05-30/apple-ios-18-siri-ai-update-will-let-users-control-features-in-apps-with-voice"><em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman</a> says that the update will let &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; control all individual features in apps for the first time, expanding the range of functions the personal assistant can perform.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/04/iOS-18-Siri-Integrated-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-945741" /><br/>
&zwnj;Siri&zwnj; will be able to do things like open specific documents, move a note from one folder to another, delete an email, summarize an article, email a web link, and open a particular news site in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-news-plus/">Apple News</a>. Apple plans to use AI to analyze what people are doing on their devices, automatically enabling &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; features.<br/>
<br/>
To make this happen, Apple engineers had to rearchitect &zwnj;Siri&zwnj;'s underlying software with large language models or LLMs, which is also the technology that's been used for chatbots like ChatGPT. Apple has been working on a deal with OpenAI to integrate OpenAI's ChatGPT technology into &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj;, and it is also in talks with Google about incorporating Gemini, but &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; functionality likely relies on Apple's own LLM work.<br/>
<br/>
At launch, the new &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; functionality will be limited to Apple apps, and &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; will only be able to respond to one command at a time. Eventually, Apple wants &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; to be able to respond to multiple commands, such as capturing a photo and then sending it to someone in a message.<br/>
<br/>
While the &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; features will be introduced at <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/wwdc/">WWDC 2024</a>, Apple reportedly does not plan to launch them in September when &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj; sees an initial release. Instead, &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; will be overhauled in a future &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj; update that's set to be introduced in 2025.<br/>
<br/>
Basic AI tasks in &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj; will be processed on device, but more advanced capabilities will rely on Apple's cloud servers. Gurman previously said that Apple would power all of the initial &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj; features on-device without relying on cloud technology in order to preserve privacy, but rumors have shifted in recent weeks. Part of Apple's new &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; technology will include code for determining whether a request can be processed on device or requires Apple's servers. On-device &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj; AI capabilities will largely require an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a> or later to work, and an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m1/">M1</a> or later for iPadOS 18 and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-15/">macOS 15</a>.<br/>
<br/>
According to <em><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/29/ios-18-cloud-ai-features-privacy-protections/">The Information</a></em>, Apple's AI servers will be powered by <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m2/">M2</a> Ultra and M4 chips, with Apple planning to use the Secure Enclave to "to help isolate the data being processed on its servers so that it can't be seen by the wider system or Apple." Gurman says that Apple will also provide customers with an "intelligent report" that explains how information is kept safe.<br/>
<br/>
We'll hear all about the AI functionality coming to &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; in just over 10 days. &zwnj;WWDC 2024&zwnj; is set to begin on Monday, June 10.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a></div><div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/bloomberg-com/">Bloomberg</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/30/ai-siri-features-ios-18-2025/">More Advanced AI Siri Functionality Not Coming to iOS 18 Until 2025</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/more-advanced-ai-siri-functionality-not-coming-to-ios-18-until-2025.2427773/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today released a trio of short ads designed to promote the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-card/">Apple Card</a>, which is Apple's credit card that continues to be limited to the United States.<br/>
<br/>
The Sock, Sweater, and Ladder spots all highlight different &zwnj;Apple Card&zwnj; features. Sock focuses on the Daily Cash back reward, Sweater demonstrates the option to see past purchases, and Ladder shows the ease of paying an &zwnj;Apple Card&zwnj; balance through the Wallet app.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe title="Apple Card Sweater Apple" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ynwBRLN3bms" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div><br/>

All three ads feature the tagline "Reboot your credit card" and link to <a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-card/">the Apple Card website</a> so that potential customers can get more information.<br/>
<br/>
&zwnj;Apple Card&zwnj; has been available in the U.S. since 2019, and it integrates with the Wallet app for easy purchase management. Daily Cash back, which is delivered same-day, is one of the key features. Customers get one percent cash back from standard physical card purchases, two percent for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-pay/">Apple Pay</a> purchases, and three percent cash back at select partner stores and Apple retail locations.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-ads/">Apple Ads</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-card/">Apple Card</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/30/apple-shares-new-apple-card-ads/">Apple Shares New Ads Promoting Apple Card</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-shares-new-ads-promoting-apple-card.2427761/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Amazon today has a low price on three models of the Apple Watch Ultra 2, available for <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0CHX76WNC%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"><strong>&#36;714.00</strong></a>, down from &#36;799.00. Right now only Amazon has this sale, and it does not require a coupon in order to see the discount.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/apple-watch-ultra-2-purple.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-939712" /><em><small>Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with Amazon. When you click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment, which helps us keep the site running.</small></em><br/>
<br/>
Models on sale at this price include the <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0CHX76WNC%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1">Green/Grey Trail Loop (S/M)</a>, the <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0CHX94FRH%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1">Blue/Black Trail Loop (S/M)</a>, and the <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0CHX8Z6W4%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1">Indigo Alpine Loop (Small)</a>. Stock on the Blue/Black Trail Loop has been dwindling this afternoon, but the other two models appear well stocked as of writing.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0CHX76WNC%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"target="_blank"><div class="fancybutton"><div class="fancybadge">&#36;85 OFF</div>Apple Watch Ultra 2 for &#36;714.00</div></a></div><br/>
<br/>
Although we tracked a steeper discount on the Apple Watch Ultra 2 back in March, that sale was a bit of a fluke and only ever appeared for one model and has never returned. This makes today's discounts at Amazon solid second-best prices on the high-end wearable, and they can be delivered as soon as this weekend for Prime members.<br/>
<br/>
There are a few other Apple Watch deals going on right now for anyone interested in cheaper models. You can get the 40mm GPS Apple Watch SE for <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0CHXCXKPD%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"><strong>&#36;189.00</strong></a> and the 44mm GPS Apple Watch SE for <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0CHX5W8YM%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1%26geniuslink%3Dtrue"><strong>&#36;219.00</strong></a> right now on Amazon.<br/>

<br/>

Retailers are able to take advantage of the NFC chip in the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; to accept credit and debit card payments, as well as <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-pay/">Apple Pay</a> and other digital payment options. Tap to Pay on &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; does not require additional hardware and it replaces hardware-based payment systems such as the Square Reader.<br/>
<br/>
Tap to Pay on &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; is available to payment platforms and payment app developers in Italy. Adyen, myPOS, Nexi, Revolut, Stripe, SumUp, and Viva are all supporting Tap to Pay, and Fabrick, Numia, and Sella will also be adding Tap to Pay integration in the near future. Starting today, Tap to Pay on &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; can be used in all Apple retail stores in Italy as well.<br/>
<blockquote>"Tap to Pay on iPhone has revolutionized the checkout experience in many types of businesses in Europe and other countries, and we are happy to partner with payment platforms to support merchants in Italy by offering them a simple, secure and private way to accept contactless payments via iPhone and a partner-enabled iOS app, without the need for additional devices," said Jennifer Bailey, Vice President of Apple Pay and Apple Wallet at Apple. "Over 4.3 million small and medium-sized companies in Italy have long played a key role in the country's economy and, together with payment platforms, developers and developers of apps and payment networks, we are making it easier than ever for Italian businesses of all sizes to accept contactless payments and continue to grow their business."</blockquote><br/>
When a customer makes a purchase, a merchant that supports Tap to Pay on &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; can accept payment by having the customer bring their credit card, debit card, prepaid card, &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;, Apple Watch, or other digital wallet close to the merchant's &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;. The transaction is completed through NFC, with processing done using the Secure Element for security purposes.<br/>
<br/>
Tap to Pay on &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; requires an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; XS or newer model, and a contactless card or device also needed. Contactless cards from American Express, Global Discover Network, Diners, Mastercard, and Visa will work.<br/>
<br/>
Italy is the 11th country where Tap to Pay on &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; is available. Apple previously rolled out the feature in the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, Japan, the Netherlands, Brazil, France, Taiwan, and Ukraine.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/italy/">Italy</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tap-to-pay-on-iphone/">Tap to Pay on iPhone</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/30/apple-brings-tap-to-pay-on-iphone-to-italy/">Apple Brings Tap to Pay on iPhone to Italy</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-brings-tap-to-pay-on-iphone-to-italy.2427755/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

The Docking Station uses DisplayLink software technology to allow a Mac to connect to up to four external monitors, plus it offers 96W power delivery and Thunderbolt 4 transfer speeds.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/satechi-thunderbolt-dock.jpg" alt="" width="1579" height="888" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-952797" /><br/>
Made from a space gray aluminum that is meant to match Apple devices, the hub supports up to four extended monitors at 4K/60Hz resolution, or one display at 8K/60Hz. With four displays, two can be connected through Thunderbolt 4 and two through HDMI. Satechi says that this feature is designed to address the single display limit of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m1/">M1</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m2/">M2</a>, and M3 chips. &zwnj;M1&zwnj;, &zwnj;M2&zwnj;, and M3 MacBook Pro models support up to three displays with Satechi's dock, while the M3 <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/">MacBook Air</a> supports four when in clamshell mode. Machines with Pro and Max chips support up to four displays through the hub.<br/>
<br/>
The hub provides 96W power delivery to the host machine, which is enough to charge even the 16-inch MacBook Pro. Each of the three Thunderbolt 4 downstream ports also offer 15W for charging iPhones, Apple Watches, and other accessories, with two ports able to be used at one time for charging purposes. The Thunderbolt 4 ports facilitate data transfers at speeds up to 40Gb/s, and there are two USB-A ports that support transfer speeds up to 10Gb/s. a UHS-II SD card reader is available as well, and it is capable of transferring up to 312MB/s.<br/>
<br/>
Satechi says the dock supports daisy-chaining up to six devices, providing 32Gb/s native PCIe support for external GPUs and Thunderbolt-based storage devices.<br/>
<br/>

The MX Keys S can connect to three different Apple devices simultaneously, allowing for easy switching with the press of a button. It is available in Space Gray and Pale Gray, and incorporates post-consumer recycled plastic in its construction.<br/>
<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple is planning to introduce new AI features including Smart Replies for messages and a generative retouch tool for photos in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a>, a new report claims.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/04/Apple-Silicon-AI-Optimized-Feature-Siri-1.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-947754" /><br/>
A new article from <em><a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/24/05/30/ios-18-project-greymatter-will-use-ai-to-summarize-notifications-articles-and-much-more">AppleInsider</a></em> today revealed some further detail about several of &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj;'s widely anticipated AI features. <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a> is rumored to receive some major upgrades including:<br/>
<br/>
<ul><br/>
	<li><strong>Improved Responses</strong>: Significantly updated response generation capabilities with a new smart response framework that takes into account entities such as people, companies, calendar events, locations, dates, and more.</li><br/>
	<li><strong>Enhanced Voices</strong>: "More natural" voices with better text-to-speech functionality.</li><br/>
	<li><strong>Cross-Device Media Controls</strong>: Use &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; on one device to control playback on another, such as via the Apple Watch for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a>. This feature is not expected to arrive until later in 2024.</li><br/>
	<li><strong>Catch Up</strong>: Users can request an overview of their recent notifications via &zwnj;Siri&zwnj;.</li></ul><br/>
<br/>
A range of other AI-powered features are also in the works for specific apps in &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj;:<br/>
<br/>
<ul><br/>
<li><strong>Smart Replies</strong>: Allows users to reply to messages and emails with automatically generated text responses.</li><br/>
	<li><strong>Transcription and Summarization</strong>: New AI tools for the Notes app allowing users to edit audio in the app, transcribe audio, and summarize text.</li><br/>
<li><strong>Math Notes</strong>: Support for proper mathematical notation in the Notes app with Calculator app integation. Math Notes will allow the Notes app to recognise mathematical equations and come up with solutions and generate graphs.</li><br/>
<li><strong>Keyboard Math Predictions</strong>: Input enhancements for mathematics enabling the completion of complex mathematical expressions when recognised as part of text input, similar to predictive text or inline text completion.</li><br/>
	<li><strong>Clean Up</strong>: Remove objects from photos using generative AI. This tool will replace Apple's current "Retouch" feature.</li><br/>
	<li><strong>Generative Playground</strong>: Application that uses generative AI to create and edit images with an iMessage app extension. It is currently designed for Apple's internal test environments only, but indicates that there are plans to allow users to generate images and then share them via iMessage. This could be related to rumored plans to allow users to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/26/10-ai-features-coming-in-ios-18/">generate custom emojis</a>.</li></ul><br/>
<br/>
<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/visionos/">visionOS</a> 2 will also apparently gain an improved predictive text model thanks to integration with Apple's Transformer LM, as well as a redesigned Voice Commands UI. Updates to the Calendar and Freeform apps, as well as System Settings for macOS, are also said to be planned. Apple's selection of new AI features are expected to be previewed during the company's WWDC keynote on June 10. <div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a></div><div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/appleinsider-com/">AppleInsider</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/artificial-intelligence/">Artificial Intelligence</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/30/more-details-about-ios-18s-ai-features-revealed/">More Details About iOS 18&#039;s AI Features Revealed</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/more-details-about-ios-18s-ai-features-revealed.2427731/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

Over 100 million Japanese residents currently have My Number Card IDs, which enable them to receive services at over 60,000 convenience stores around the country, through online portals, and in other settings such as hospitals and government agencies. <blockquote>"The deployment of Apple Wallet's ID feature outside the United States is an important step in our vision of replacing traditional physical wallets with easy, secure, and private mobile wallets. We will make the My Number Card available in Apple Wallet from the second half of next spring, and we will present your ID while making full use of the security and privacy protection features built into the iPhone. We are very pleased to provide a convenient and convenient way for everyone living in Japan," said Jennifer Bailey, vice president of Apple Pay and Apple Wallet.</blockquote>Once loaded into Apple Wallet, a user's My Number Card can be accessed within the app by authenticating with <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mask-face-id/">Face ID</a> or <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/touch-id/">Touch ID</a>, and the ID can then be presented either face-to-face or to a card reader, enabling access to medical services, governmental services, and more.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[The developers behind popular photography app Halide <a href="https://www.shotwithkino.com/">today announced the launch of Kino</a>, an app designed for capturing cinematic video. Kino has the tools that professionals need while also providing guidance to amateur videographers.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/kino-camera-app.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-952794" /><br/>
Kino offers a one-tap video recording feature with support for a range of color presets. The Instant Grade feature allows users to choose presets created by experts or import their own LUTs. By applying color grading while recording, Kino saves time by removing the need for editing.<br/>
<br/>
An AutoMotion feature helps users capture cinematic movement in a shot by using a 180-degree shutter angle by default. When enough ambient light is available, the Auto label will turn green to indicate that it is an ideal time to capture motion.<br/>
<br/>
While the Kino interface is designed to be simple to use, there are a number of pro tools that can be selected. There are options for adjusting exposure with RV adjustment and AE, and WB lock, or there is a full manual mode for control over shutter speed and ISO.<br/>
<br/>
The app includes quick access tools for adjusting resolution, framerate, encoding, and more, plus there is a level grid, RBG waveform for adjusting exposure, and focus peaking for changing focus. Kino is able to store video recordings in the Files app instead of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/photos/">Photos</a> app for easier video management.<br/>
<br/>
For those new to video recording, there are a series of lessons that can be used to learn all of the available features that are in Kino.<br/>
<br/>
Kino can be downloaded from the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a> for &#36;9.99, a discount of 50 percent off of the standard price. <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a> is required.

		<description><![CDATA[iOS 18 is just around the corner, with Apple set to unveil the software update during its WWDC keynote next month. Below, we recap new features and changes rumored for iOS 18, which is projected to be the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/28/ios-18-big-expectations/">"biggest" update in the iPhone's history</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/iOS-18-WWDC-24-Feature-2.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-944197" /><br/>
iOS 18 is rumored to include new AI features for Siri and many apps, and Apple plans to add RCS support to the Messages app for an improved texting experience between iPhones and Android devices. The update is also expected to introduce a more customizable Home Screen and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/25/ios-18-design-changes-rumors/">other user interface design changes</a>, new features in apps like Apple Maps and Calculator, additional accessibility features, and much more.<br/>
<br/>
WWDC 2024 will begin with Apple's keynote <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/28/wwdc-2024-full-schedule/">on June 10 at 10 a.m. Pacific Time</a>, and the iOS 18 beta should be made available to members of the Apple Developer Program immediately following the presentation. A public beta is typically released in July, and the update should be widely released to all users in September.<br/>
<br/>
For additional information, read our <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18 roundup</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Smarter Siri and Generative AI</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/iOS-18-Mock-Siri-Feature-Baubles.jpg" alt="" width="2250" height="1266" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-909208" /><br/>
iOS 18 is rumored to have <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/16/ios-18-slew-of-new-ai-features/">new AI features</a> for Siri, Spotlight, Shortcuts, Apple Music, Messages, Health, Numbers, Pages, Keynote, and more, according to sources such as <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman and <em>The Information</em>'s Wayne Ma.<br/>
<br/>
Apple CEO Tim Cook has repeatedly teased that the company is working on generative AI, and plans to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/01/apple-ai-details-coming-later-this-year/">share details "later this year,"</a> and Apple's marketing chief Greg Joswiak also <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/26/apple-ios-18-ai-wwdc-2024/">hinted at AI</a> in a social media post about WWDC 2024.<br/>
<br/>
Generative AI surged in popularity in late 2022, when OpenAI released ChatGPT, a chatbot that can respond to questions and other text prompts. The company has also expanded into generative AI tools for images and videos. Other companies like Google and Microsoft have also pushed into the generative AI space, and the technology is quickly evolving.<br/>
<br/>
iOS 18 is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/26/ios-18-reportedly-wont-have-apple-chatbot/">not expected to include an Apple-designed chatbot</a>, but a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/13/apple-finalizing-deal-openai-chatgpt-ios-18/">partnership with OpenAI</a> will reportedly be announced at WWDC.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>More Customizable Home Screen</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/iPhone-Home-Screen-Gradient-Blank-Spaces-1.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-943087" /><br/>
iOS 18 will feature a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/24/ios-18-more-customizable-home-screen-rumor/">"more customizable" Home Screen</a>, according to Gurman.<br/>
<br/>
<em>MacRumors</em> exclusively reported that iOS 18 will finally allow users to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/24/ios-18-home-screen-app-icon-customization/">place app icons anywhere on the Home Screen grid</a>. This means that users will be able to create blank spaces, columns, and rows between app icons. This basic feature has long been available on Android smartphones, and now Apple is bringing it to the iPhone.<br/>
<br/>
iPhone users can already customize the Home Screen with apps such as Shortcuts and Widgetsmith, which can be used to create "blank" app icons and widgets, but Apple's official solution will be much more convenient.<br/>
<br/>
It was also reported that iOS 18 will allow users to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/26/ios-18-to-allow-users-to-recolor-app-icons/">change the color of app icons</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>New Accessibility Features</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/iOS-18-Hover-Typing-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-950842" /><br/>
Earlier this month, Apple previewed many new accessibility features coming later this year with software updates like iOS 18, iPadOS 18, macOS 15, and visionOS 2. The announcement came one day ahead of Global Accessibility Awareness Day.<br/>
<br/>
Some of the new features coming to the iPhone <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/15/ios-18-accessibility-features/">include Eye Tracking</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/15/apple-reduce-motion-sickness-feature/">Vehicle Motion Cues</a>, Music Haptics, and Vocal Shortcuts. <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/15/ios-18-accessibility-features-for-carplay/">CarPlay will also be getting more accessibility features</a> with iOS 18, including Sound Recognition, which will allow drivers or passengers who are deaf or hard of hearing to turn on alerts to be notified of car horns and sirens.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>New Apple Maps Features</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/03/apple-maps-3d-feature.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="896" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-841030" /><br/>
<em>MacRumors</em> previously revealed two potential new Apple Maps features coming with iOS 18: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/26/apple-maps-custom-routes-ios-18/">custom routes</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/27/ios-18-topographic-maps/">topographic maps</a>.<br/>
<br/>
With the custom routes feature, Apple Maps users would be able to choose specific roads to travel on while navigating, for reasons such as familiarity or scenic views. This feature is expected to be available in the U.S. only at launch. Google Maps already allows users to create custom routes on the web, and then view them on an iPhone.<br/>
<br/>
Topographic maps first debuted on the Apple Watch last year with watchOS 10, and code suggests that the feature will be expanded to the iPhone, Mac, and Vision Pro with iOS 18, macOS 15, and visionOS 2. These maps include details such as trails, contour lines, elevation, and points of interest for hiking and other outdoor uses.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>RCS Support in Messages App</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/07/General-Apps-Messages.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1407" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-808613" /><br/>
In November, Apple announced that it would <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/16/apple-to-adopt-rcs-messaging-standard/">support the cross-platform messaging standard RCS</a> in the Messages app on the iPhone starting "later" in 2024, so it will likely be an iOS 18 feature based on that timeframe.<br/>
<br/>
RCS support should result in the following improvements to the default messaging experience between iPhones and Android devices:<ul><br/>
 <li>Higher-resolution photos and videos</li><br/>
 <li>Audio messages</li><br/>
 <li>Typing indicators</li><br/>
 <li>Read receipts</li><br/>
 <li>Wi-Fi messaging</li><br/>
 <li>Improved group chats, including the ability for iPhone users to leave a conversation that includes Android users</li></li><br/>
</ul>These features are already available for iMessage and in many third-party messaging apps, such as WhatsApp and Telegram. RCS support on the iPhone will extend the features to green bubbles in the Messages app.<br/>
<br/>

The app is also rumored to gain a built-in audio recording tool, eliminating the need to switch over to the Voice Memos app. In addition, both Notes and Voice Memos could gain the ability to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/10/ios-18-audio-transcriptions-rumor/">transcribe audio</a>.</li><br/>
<li><strong>Safari:</strong> iOS 18 is likely to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/10/ios-18-safari-browsing-assistant-rumor/">add a browsing assistant to Safari</a>, which could <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/30/safari-ai-features-coming-in-ios-18/">summarize web pages and more</a>.
