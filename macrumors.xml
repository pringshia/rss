		<description><![CDATA[Samsung kicked off its <a href="https://howl.me/ck6A9ZkhXNT">Cyber Week sale</a> a few days ago, offering discounts across smartphones, smartwatches, tablets, computers, and home appliances. Many of the deals in this sale are the same exact prices we tracked during Samsung's Black Friday sale, making Samsung one of the few retailers to keep these best-ever prices around all week. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/samsung-best-holiday.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-923404" /><em><small>Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with Samsung. When you click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment, which helps us keep the site running.</small></em><br/>
<br/>
Right now, both the Smart Monitor M8 and ViewFinity S9 5K Display have all-time low prices on Amazon. The Smart Monitor M8 is available for <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2FB0C3WMX69W%2Fref%3Dox_sc_act_title_1%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26smid%3DATVPDKIKX0DER%26th%3D1%26geniuslink%3Dtrue"><strong>&#36;399.99</strong></a> (&#36;300 off) and the ViewFinity S9 5K Display is available for <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2FB0CB71BY87%2Fref%3Dox_sc_act_title_1%3Fsmid%3DATVPDKIKX0DER%26th%3D1"><strong>&#36;1,201.82</strong></a> (&#36;398 off). The latter deal has been fluctuating on Amazon, so if it does disappear, Samsung has a second-best offer at <a href="https://howl.me/ck3bAoFu1ed">&#36;1,299.99</a> for the next few days.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://howl.me/ck6A9ZkhXNT"target="_blank"><div class="fancybutton"><div class="fancybadge">SITEWIDE SALE</div>Samsung Cyber Week</div></a></div><br/>
<br/>
Samsung is encouraging users to shop through the Shop Samsung mobile app this season, which has some exclusive deals and deep discounts on smartphones, smartwatches, and mobile accessories. Clicking any of the Samsung links in this post while on mobile should give you the option to install the app.<br/>
<br/>
Other than monitors and TVs, we're also now tracking quite a few deals on refrigerators, tablets, and computers below. These sale prices will be live for this week only, so be sure to check out Samsung's event before the best prices of the year disappear.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple pays British chip architect Arm less than 30 cents per chip in royalties, <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/how-a-lopsided-apple-deal-got-under-arms-skin"><em>The Information</em></a> reports.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/02/arm-logo-blue-bg.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-783300" /><br/>
Apple licenses the underlying technology used in the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>, Mac, Apple Watch, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a>, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod/">HomePod</a> from Arm. Despite being one of its biggest and most important customers, Apple represents less than five percent of Arm's annual revenue, with the company paying the least of any of Arm's smartphone chip customers. Apple pays a flat fee of less than 30 cents in royalties for each chip used in its devices, regardless of how many cores it has.<br/>
<br/>
SoftBank is the owner of Arm, and in 2017, the company's CEO gathered Arm executives and explained that Apple pays more for the piece of plastic that used to be used to protect the screens of new iPhones than it does to license Arm's intellectual property. SoftBank's attempts to renegotiate Arm's deal with Apple to raise royalty rates were apparently unsuccessful. <br/>
<br/>
While Apple is unlikely to sever its ties with Arm, the company has apparently explored the long-term possibility of using a competing open-source technology for its chips called RISC-V. Apple's current licensing agreement with Arm was signed in September and it "extends beyond 2040," but the chip architect is said to have continually attempted to renegotiate its financial terms.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/theinformation-com/">The Information</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-silicon/">Apple Silicon</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/29/apple-pays-less-than-30-cents-per-chip/">Report: Apple Pays Less Than 30 Cents in Royalties to Arm Per Chip</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/report-apple-pays-less-than-30-cents-in-royalties-to-arm-per-chip.2412363/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

Apple says it donation through this initiative will be limited to a maximum of &#36;1 million.<br/>

The Global Fund aims to combat diseases such as HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria throughout the developing world. Apple says its donation to the organization will continue to "help fund critical health programs that save lives."<br/>
<br/>
Apple has supported The Global Fund for 17 years through its partnership with the (RED) brand, co-founded by U2 singer Bono in 2006. Apple offers several products in a <a href="https://www.apple.com/product-red/">(PRODUCT)RED</a> color, ranging from iPhones to Apple Watch bands, and a portion of the proceeds from every one of these products sold by Apple goes to The Global Fund.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple is discontinuing in-house modem development after several unsuccessful attempts to perfect its own custom 5G modem chip, according to unconfirmed reports coming out of Asia.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/05/Apple-5G-Modem-Feature-Triad.jpg" alt="" width="1810" height="1018" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-798434" /><br/>
According to the operator of news aggregator account <a href="https://m.blog.naver.com/PostView.naver?blogId=yeux1122&logNo=223278322589&navType=by">"yeux1122" on the Naver blog</a>, supply chain sources related to  Apple's 5G modem departments claim that the company's attempts to develop its own modem have failed so far, and that Apple is in the process of winding down its years-long investment in the project. Separately, the leaker known as <a href="https://x.com/Tech_Reve/status/1729824690951356893?s=20">@Tech_Reve</a> today said they had heard similar reports from a Japanese supply chain source.<br/>
<br/>
It's too early to say if the latest reports are accurate, but according to a September <em>Wall Street Journal</em> <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/21/apple-wsj-5gm-modem-project-challenges/">report</a>, Apple's attempts to develop its own modem chip have been hampered by major issues related to unrealistic goals, an inadequate understanding of the challenges involved, and unusable prototypes.<br/>
<br/>
Apple's plan to design its own in-house modem led to the hiring of thousands of engineers: Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2019/07/25/apple-intel-acquisition/">acquired</a> the majority of Intel's smartphone modem business in 2019, and as it filled the project's ranks with Intel engineers and others hired from Qualcomm, company executives set a goal to have the modem chip ready for fall 2023.<br/>
<br/>
Earlier this month, <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/16/apple-in-house-5g-modem-delays/">reported</a> that Apple was continuing to run into troubles in its attempt to develop a 5G modem to replace Qualcomm's 5G modems in the iPhone and other products. The modem chip launch was said to have been postponed until the end of 2025 or early 2026, but Apple was reportedly still planning to introduce the technology in a version of the low-cost iPhone SE.<br/>
<br/>
Development on a modem chip was said to be in the early stages, and it "may lag behind the competition by years." One version in development does not support faster mmWave technology, and Apple has also run into issues with the Intel code that it has been working with. Rewrites have been required, and adding new features has been causing existing features to break, plus Apple has to be careful not to infringe on Qualcomm patents while developing the chip.<br/>
<br/>
Despite delays, the company was thought to be continuing development because it is eager to end its expensive deal with Qualcomm. In 2017, Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2017/01/20/apple-qualcomm-1-billion-lawsuit/">sued Qualcomm</a> over alleged anticompetitive practices and &#36;1 billion in unpaid royalty rebates. The two companies <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2019/04/16/apple-qualcomm-settlement/">settled the lawsuit in 2019</a>. <br/>
<br/>
Apple's first modem chip was expected to be a standalone chip, but the company hoped to eventually develop a system-on-a-chip that would also cut out suppliers like Broadcom and give it more control over component development.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-5g-modem/">Apple 5G Modem</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/29/apple-5g-modem-discontinued-reports/">Apple to Discontinue Custom 5G Modem Development, Claim Reports</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-to-discontinue-custom-5g-modem-development-claim-reports.2412350/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

<br/>

Rolling out over the next three days, the scanning feature can be accessed via the app's camera icon. The scanner detects the edges of a document in the viewfinder, aligns things properly, and removes all glare and tilt to achieve a clean scan ready for uploading. <br/>
<br/>
Multiple pages can be scanned in a session, users can crop scans if needed, and users residing in the U.S. can receive relevant title suggestions based on machine learning, according to Google. Apple has included a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/ios-11-document-scanner-notes/">similar scanning feature in its stock Notes app</a> since 2017.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple is ending its credit card partnership with Goldman Sachs, according to <em><a href="https://www.wsj.com/finance/banking/apple-pulls-plug-on-goldman-credit-card-partnership-ca1dfb45">The Wall Street Journal</a></em>. Apple plans to stop working with Goldman Sachs in the next 12 to 15 months, and it is not yet clear if Apple has established a new partnership for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-card/">Apple Card</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-785924" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/02/apple-card-1.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" /><br/>
Apple and Goldman Sachs will dissolve their entire consumer partnership, including the &zwnj;Apple Card&zwnj; and the Apple Savings account. Apple in a statement that was provided to <em><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/11/28/apple-is-trying-to-unwind-its-goldman-sachs-credit-card-partnership.html">CNBC</a></em> said that it will continue to provide "the best tools and services" for &zwnj;Apple Card&zwnj; customers.<blockquote>"Apple and Goldman Sachs are focused on providing an incredible experience for our customers to help them lead healthier financial lives. The award-winning Apple Card has seen a great reception from consumers, and we will continue to innovate and deliver the best tools and services for them."</blockquote>Rumors earlier this year suggested that Goldman Sachs wanted to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/06/30/goldman-sachs-apple-partnership-amex/">get out of its relationship</a> with Apple as part of a plan to cut back on its consumer business. Goldman Sachs at the time was said to be speaking with American Express about a possible takeover, but the &zwnj;Apple Card&zwnj; needs to run on the Mastercard network until 2026 due to a deal established between Apple and Goldman Sachs. Amex also had concerns about aspects of the program such as loan loss rates due to Apple's push to have customers approved, so the status of the talks is not known.<br/>
<br/>
Synchrony Financial, known as the largest issuer of store credit cards, has considered taking over the &zwnj;Apple Card&zwnj;, according to <em>The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/wsj-com/">Wall Street Journal</a></em>. <br/>
<br/>
Goldman Sachs and Apple have worked together on the &zwnj;Apple Card&zwnj; since it launched in 2019, and have also teamed up for the high-yield Apple Savings account and the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-pay/">Apple Pay</a> Later feature. The partnership <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/07/25/apple-goldman-sachs-apple-card-issues/">has not gone smoothly</a>, with Goldman Sachs running into <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/07/25/apple-goldman-sachs-apple-card-issues/">customer service issues</a> due to long wait times for disputed &zwnj;Apple Card&zwnj; transactions and issues with the Apple Savings account.<br/>
<br/>
The U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/us-fed-probes-goldman-sachs-consumer-business-wsj-2023-01-20/">launched an investigation</a> into Goldman Sachs due to the customer complaints, leading to tension with Apple. Apple is unhappy with the customer service reputation of its &zwnj;Apple Card&zwnj; and Apple Savings products, while some Goldman Sachs executives blame Apple for the regulatory scrutiny. <br/>
<br/>
Goldman Sachs was new to consumer banking when the &zwnj;Apple Card&zwnj; launched, and to establish a deal with Apple, it is not collecting fees that many credit card issuers receive. The bank does not get a cut of the fee that merchants pay to Apple to accept the &zwnj;Apple Card&zwnj;, nor is it able to collect annual fees, late fees, or foreign transaction fees. Goldman Sachs does earn money from loans issued to cardholders who split Apple purchases into installments, but it is not known if Apple will be able to establish a similar deal with another issuer because of the limited revenue the &zwnj;Apple Card&zwnj; provides. <br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/28/apple-goldman-sachs-partnership-ending/">Apple Ending Apple Card Partnership With Goldman Sachs</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-ending-apple-card-partnership-with-goldman-sachs.2412297/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple is wrapping up development on iOS 17.2, with the update expected to come out in December. While we're getting to the end of the beta testing period, Apple is still tweaking features and adding new functionality.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/iOS-17.2-Feature-Warm.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-918854" /><br/>
We've rounded up everything new in the fourth beta of iOS 17.2.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Default Notification Sound</h2><br/>
Under Sounds & Haptics, there's a new "Default Alerts" section that allows you to choose the sound used for all incoming notifications aside from texts, mail alerts, and calendar alerts, which already had customization options.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/ios-17-default-alert.jpg" alt="" width="5526" height="3108" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-924433" /><br/>
All of the text tones can be used for the default notification sound, plus there is an option to also change the haptic vibration of default notifications.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Collaborative Apple Music Playlists</h2><br/>
While collaborative <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/">Apple Music</a> playlists were introduced in an earlier version of iOS 17.2, Apple has removed the option in the fourth beta, which suggests this is not an option that will be coming in iOS 17.2 after all.<br/>
<br/>

<h2>AppleCare Settings</h2><br/>
The "Coverage" section under Settings > General has been renamed to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/applecare/">AppleCare</a> & Warranty. It still includes &zwnj;AppleCare&zwnj; info for your <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> and connected devices such as the Apple Watch and AirPods.<br/>
<br/>

Under General > About there's a new Warranty section that provides coverage information for the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Recording to an External Device</h2><br/>
With the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a> models, ProRes video can be recorded directly to an external device. iOS 17.2 appears to include a new pop up message that lets users know that external recording is not working because of a USB-C cable that is too slow.<br/>
<br/>
There was previously a warning about an external storage device not having a fast enough write speed to support external recording, but now there is an added message about the write speed of the USB-C cable.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>iTunes</h2><br/>
Code in iOS 17.2 confirms that Apple is planning to eliminate the option to purchase TV shows and movies in the iTunes app. TV and movie content will need to be purchased in the TV app in the future, but for now, the change has not actually been implemented.<br/>
<br/>
"You can buy or rent TV shows and find your purchases in the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a> app," reads the code.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Best Buy's Cyber Monday sale has transitioned into a <a href="https://howl.me/ck6b1vcE1Me">"Holiday Deals" event</a> that's promising new discounts and offers every day for the next 20 days. For today, the focus is on a few laptop deals, including the 13-inch M2 MacBook Air.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/best-buy-cyber-week.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-924428" /><em><small>Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with some of these vendors. When you click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment, which helps us keep the site running.</small></em><br/>
<br/>
As with the Black Friday and Cyber Monday deals we saw, some of the discounts below require a <a href="https://howl.me/ck6bXDtyIMr">My Best Buy Plus or My Best Buy Total membership</a>. These start at &#36;49.99/year and grant members early access to sales, exclusive discounts on select products, and more.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://howl.me/ck6b1vcE1Me"target="_blank"><div class="fancybutton"><div class="fancybadge">Sitewide Sale</div>Best Buy Holiday Deals Event</div></a></div><h2>MacBook Air</h2><br/>

<br/>
The highlight of the sale is Apple's 256GB 13.6-inch M2 MacBook Air for <a href="https://howl.me/ck6bCMrS1iS"><strong>&#36;949.00</strong></a>, down from &#36;1,099.00. Best Buy has this sale price in all four colors, and it represents a solid second-best price on the 2022 notebook.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/28/apple-releases-ios-17-2-beta-4/">fourth beta of iOS 17.2</a> that Apple released today adds a much-desired feature, the option to change the default notification alert.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/ios-17-default-alert.jpg" alt="" width="5526" height="3108" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-924433" /><br/>
Under Sounds & Haptics, there's a new "Default Alerts" section that allows you to choose the sound used for all incoming notifications aside from texts, mail alerts, and calendar alerts, which already had customization options. <br/>
<br/>
Apple has not previously offered an interface for tweaking the default notification sound, so this is a notable update for those who have always wanted to select a sound. All of the text tones can be used for the default notification sound.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">iOS 17.2 beta 4 allows you to change the default notification sound and haptic <a href="https://t.co/f7Vxny3Jcc">pic.twitter.com/f7Vxny3Jcc</a></p>&mdash; iSoftware Updates (@iSWUpdates) <a href="https://twitter.com/iSWUpdates/status/1729568826751152479?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 28, 2023</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div><br/>
There's also an option to change the default haptic feedback. Apple in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a> changed the haptic alert, and now it can be changed back or customized for those who were not happy with the update. <div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-17/">iPadOS 17</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-17.241">iOS 17</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-17.242">iPadOS 17</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/28/ios-17-2-change-default-notification/">iOS 17.2 Beta Adds Option to Change Default Notification Sound and Haptics</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-17-2-beta-adds-option-to-change-default-notification-sound-and-haptics.2412271/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today released the fourth betas of upcoming iOS 17.2 and iPadOS 17.2 updates to developers for testing purposes, with the software coming two weeks after Apple released the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/14/apple-seeds-ios-17-2-beta-3-to-developers/">the third betas of iOS 17.2 and iPadOS 17.2</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-918852" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/iOS-17.2-Feature-Cool.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" /><br/>
Registered developers are able to opt into the betas by opening up the Settings app, going to the Software Update section, tapping on the "Beta Updates" option, and toggling on the ‌<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a> or <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-17/">iPadOS 17</a>‌ Developer Beta. An <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-id/">Apple ID</a> associated with a developer account is required to download and install the beta.<br/>
<br/>
The biggest new feature in iOS 17.2 is the Journal app, which can be used to record daily activities and thoughts. You can write about your day to day life, but Apple also provides topic suggestions based on the music you listen to, the places you visit, and the people you see. Journal entries support pictures, voice recordings, and location information, with the app organized by entry date.<br/>
<br/>
In <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/">Apple Music</a>, there's a Favorites playlist that houses everything you've favorited, plus Apple added support for collaborative playlists. You can now share a playlist with multiple people, and each participant can add songs.<br/>
<br/>
Stickers can now be used to reply to iMessages when you long press on a chat bubble in the Messages app, and there's also now support for the extra-secure iMessage Contact Key Verification option. If you have an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a>, the Action Button supports Translate in iOS 17.2, and there are new Weather and Clock widgets.<br/>

To install the ‌watchOS 10.2‌ update, developers will need to open the Apple Watch app, go to the Software Update section under "General" in Settings, and toggle on the ‌<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/watchos-10/">watchOS 10</a>‌ Developer Beta. An <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-id/">Apple ID</a> linked to a developer account is required.<br/>
<br/>
Once beta updates have been activated, ‌&zwnj;watchOS 10&zwnj;‌ can be downloaded under the same Software Update section. To install software, an Apple Watch needs to have 50 percent battery life and it must be placed on an Apple Watch charger.<br/>
<br/>
watchOS 10.2 adds support for iMessage Contact Key Verification, a feature designed for those who face "extraordinary digital threats," such as journalists, human rights activists, and government officials.<br/>
<br/>
Users can ensure that there is no "man in the middle" snooping on iMessage conversations, and there is a Contact Verification Code so that iMessage users can verify that they're speaking to the correct individual during in-person meetings or on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/facetime/">FaceTime</a> calls.<br/>
<br/>
The update also reintroduces an option to change watch faces by swiping left and right.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/watchos-10/">watchOS 10</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-programming.135">Apple Programming</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/28/apple-seeds-watchos-10-2-beta-4-to-developers/">Apple Seeds Fourth Beta of watchOS 10.2 to Developers</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-seeds-fourth-beta-of-watchos-10-2-to-developers.2412266/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today seeded the fourth beta of an upcoming tvOS 17.2 to developers for testing purposes, with the beta coming two weeks after the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/14/apple-seeds-tvos-17-2-beta-3-to-developers/">release of the third tvOS 17.2 beta</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-869857" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/10/Apple-TV-2022-Feature-Blue.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" /><br/>
Registered developers are able to download the tvOS 17.2 update by opting in to the beta through the Settings app on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a>. A registered developer account is required.<br/>
<br/>
tvOS updates are often minor in scale compared to other operating system updates, focusing primarily on bug fixes and smaller improvements rather than notable outward-facing changes, but tvOS 17.2 introduces an overhauled &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj; app. <br/>
<br/>
The app now includes a sidebar that houses content from both Apple's services and streaming services that integrate with the tvOS Watch Now feature. There are dedicated sections for Search, Watch Now, ‌<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-tv-plus/">Apple TV+</a>‌, MLS Season Pass, Sports, the Store, and the Library at the top of the sidebar, along with dedicated sections for streaming services like ABC, CBS, Comedy Central, Hulu, ESPN, Discovery, Peacock, Prime Video, and more.<br/>
<br/>
You can click into each streaming service to see content that's available specifically on that service, and there's also a new My TV section that replaces "My Channels."<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_TV">Apple TV (Neutral)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-tv-and-home-theater.100">Apple TV and Home Theater</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/28/apple-seeds-tvos-17-2-beta-4-to-developers/">Apple Seeds Fourth Beta of tvOS 17.2 to Developers [Update: Public Beta Available]</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-seeds-fourth-beta-of-tvos-17-2-to-developers-update-public-beta-available.2412267/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[At WWDC in June 2022, Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/06/06/apple-announces-multi-display-carplay/">previewed the next generation of CarPlay</a>, promising deeper integration with vehicle functions like A/C and FM radio, support for multiple displays across the dashboard, increased personalization, and more.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/All-New-CarPlay-Five-New-Features-Article-2.jpg" alt="" width="1960" height="1102" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-918156" /><br/>
Apple's website <a href="https://www.apple.com/ios/carplay/">still says</a> the first vehicles with support for the next-generation CarPlay experience will be announced in "late 2023," but it has not shared any additional details heading into the final month of the year, so it's unclear if that timeframe will still be met. We have reached out to Apple for an update on the matter.<br/>
<br/>
Below, we have recapped five key features to expect from the new version of CarPlay. Apple said committed automakers included Acura, Audi, Ford, Honda, Jaguar, Land Rover, Mercedes-Benz, Nissan, Porsche, Volvo, and a few others.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Next-Generation CarPlay Features</h2><br/>
<h3>Instrument Cluster Integration</h3><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/06/Multi-Display-CarPlay-2.jpeg" alt="" width="1600" height="896" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-848187" /><br/>
The new CarPlay experience will provide integration with a vehicle's instrument cluster, including the speedometer, tachometer, odometer, fuel gauge, engine temperature gauge, oil pressure gauge, and more. Apple says drivers will be able to choose from several gauge cluster designs and layouts, including brand‑specific options.<br/>
<br/>
<h3>Climate Controls</h3><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/07/CarPlay-Next-Generation-Screen.jpg" alt="" width="3562" height="1990" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-853339" /><br/>
You'll be able to access your vehicle's climate controls directly within the new version of CarPlay, allowing you to adjust the temperature of the A/C or heat, fan speed, heated seats, heated steering wheel, and other options.<br/>
<br/>
<h3>Multi-Display Support</h3><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/12/CarPlay-Next-Generation-Multi-Screens.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="897" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-878824" /><br/>
The new version of CarPlay will be able to appear across all of the displays in a vehicle, providing a consistent experience across the infotainment system, instrument cluster, and any additional screens on the dashboard. Apple says CarPlay will be tailored to each new vehicle model to accommodate unique screen shapes and layouts. <br/>
<br/>
<h3>Widgets</h3><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/12/CarPlay-Next-Generation-Widgets.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-878821" /><br/>
Widgets will be a key part of the new CarPlay experience, offering at-a-glance information such as trip duration, fuel economy, distance traveled, calendar events, weather, phone calls, the status of a HomeKit-enabled garage door, and more. It will also be possible to view and scroll through the widgets within the instrument cluster.<br/>
<br/>
<h3>FM Radio App</h3><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/12/CarPlay-Next-Generation-Radio.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="899" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-878822" /><br/>
The new version of CarPlay will include an all-new Radio app that allows you to easily control the FM radio in your vehicle, such as to change the station.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>CarPlay on iOS 17</h2><br/>
In the meantime, CarPlay includes a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/06/13/whats-new-carplay-ios-17/">handful of new features and changes</a> when used with an iPhone running iOS 17, including SharePlay support in the Music app for passengers and real-time electric vehicle charging station availability.<br/>
<br/>

iOS 17 was released in September for the iPhone XS and newer.

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2023/11/apple-unveils-the-top-books-of-2023-and-a-new-year-in-review-experience/">announced</a> that its Books app now offers a "Year in Review" recap in select countries, including the U.S., U.K., Australia, Canada, France, and Germany. The feature requires an iPhone or iPad on iOS 17.1 or iPadOS 17.1 or later, and it can be found within the Read Now tab under Top Picks, for users with at least three titles marked as finished.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/Apple-Books-Year-in-Review.jpg" alt="" width="1306" height="735" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-924332" /><br/>
Year in Review allows Apple Books users to view personalized highlights about the books and audiobooks they read in 2023, including their total time spent reading, the longest book or audiobook they read, their most-read author and genre, their highest-rated book, and more. The recap can easily be shared with others.<br/>
<br/>
How to mark books or audiobooks as finished:<blockquote>To add books or audiobooks, readers can tap and hold on any book in the app and choose Mark as Finished. To change the finished date shown, users can hold down on the book and select Edit Finished Date. For titles read elsewhere, such as in hardcover or paperback, users can search for them in Apple Books and select Mark as Finished to add them to their Year in Review.</blockquote>When the "Reading Goals" option is turned on in the Settings app, under Books, users can also view their longest reading streak, the average number of minutes they spent reading in a month, and other statistics in Year in Review.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/Apple-Books-Year-in-Review-2023.jpg" alt="" width="2612" height="1828" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-924335" /><br/>
Year in Review can determine a user's personal reading type:<blockquote>There are six reader types to discover, including The Contemporary for readers of trendy titles; The Completist for readers of multiple books in a series; The Seeker for nonfiction readers; The Wanderer for multigenre readers; The Deep Diver for single-genre readers; or The Free Spirit for readers with wide-ranging interests across the book world.</blockquote>Apple also shared the most popular books in the Books app in 2023:<blockquote><strong>Top Nonfiction Books of 2023</strong><br/>
1. <em>Spare</em> by Prince Harry, The Duke of Sussex<br/>
2. <em>The Woman in Me</em> by Britney Spears<br/>
3. <em>The Wager: A Tale of Shipwreck, Mutiny and Murder</em> by David Grann<br/>

4. <em>Hello Beautiful</em> by Ann Napolitano<br/>
5. <em>The Covenant of Water</em> by Abraham Verghese</blockquote>As the end of 2023 nears, Apple has started sharing year-end content, including <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/14/apple-announces-app-store-award-finalists-2023/">award-winning apps</a> and the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/28/apple-reveals-most-popular-podcasts-of-2023/">the most popular podcasts</a>.
