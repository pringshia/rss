		<description><![CDATA[Apple plans to update its entire iPad lineup throughout 2024, according to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2023-11-05/apple-vision-pro-plan-includes-launching-initially-just-at-apple-stores-in-2024"><em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman</a>. This means new models of the iPad Pro, iPad Air, iPad mini, and entry-level iPad can be expected to launch next year.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/M3-iPad-Feature-3.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-917548" /><br/>
Gurman touched on the lack of new iPads and AirPods heading into the holiday shopping season in the latest edition of his <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2023-11-05/apple-vision-pro-plan-includes-launching-initially-just-at-apple-stores-in-2024"><em>Power On</em> newsletter</a>:<blockquote>Apple could have tried to rush out more new products, but revamped iPads and AirPods aren’t yet ready. The company plans to update its entire iPad lineup during 2024. New low-end AirPods are coming next year as well, with a refreshed Pro model following in 2025.</blockquote>2023 is expected to be the first year without any new iPads released since Apple first unveiled the device in 2010, so updates to all models next year sounds likely.<br/>
<br/>
When each iPad model was last updated:<ul><li><strong>iPad Pro:</strong> October 2022</li><br/>
<li><strong>iPad:</strong> October 2022</li><br/>
<li><strong>iPad Air:</strong> March 2022</li><br/>
<li><strong>iPad mini:</strong> September 2021</li></ul>Gurman previously reported that the low-end to mid-range iPads <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/22/gurman-new-ipads-scheduled-for-march-2024-launch/">could be updated as early as March 2024</a>, while he expects new 11-inch and 13-inch iPad Pro models with the M3 chip and OLED displays to launch in the first half of 2024. The next iPad Air and iPad mini are likely to be equipped with M2 and A16 Bionic chips, respectively.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/">iPad Air </a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-mini/">iPad mini</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPad">iPad (Neutral)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPad-Air">iPad Air (Don't Buy)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#11-iPad-Pro">11" iPad Pro (Caution)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#12-9-iPad-Pro">12.9" iPad Pro (Caution)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPad_Mini">iPad Mini (Caution)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipad.137">iPad</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/05/all-ipads-expected-to-be-updated-in-2024/">Apple Expected to Update Entire iPad Lineup Next Year</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-expected-to-update-entire-ipad-lineup-next-year.2409944/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's new M3 Pro chip with a 12-core CPU offers only marginally faster CPU performance compared to the M2 Pro chip with a 12-core CPU, according to a <a href="https://browser.geekbench.com/v6/cpu/3390128">Geekbench 6 result</a> spotted today by <a href="https://twitter.com/VadimYuryev/status/1720982471062491428">Vadim Yuryev</a>, co-host of the YouTube channel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/maxtechofficial">Max Tech</a>. This is only a single benchmark result, so further results are needed to ensure accuracy.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/m3-pro-chip.jpg" alt="" width="5104" height="2868" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-919649" /><br/>
Apple announced <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/30/apple-announces-m3-macbook-pros/">new 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models</a> with M3, M3 Pro, and M3 Max chips on Monday. This benchmark result <a href="https://twitter.com/aaronp613/status/1719775450963095885">appears to be</a> for the 14-inch model, based on the "Mac15,6" model identifier listed.<br/>
<br/>
The result shows the M3 Pro has a single-core score of 3,035 and a multi-core score of 15,173. If these scores are accurate, the M3 Pro is up to 14% faster than the M2 Pro in terms of single-core performance, but only up to 6% faster <a href="https://browser.geekbench.com/macs/macbook-pro-14-inch-2023-m2-pro-12c-cpu">in terms of multi-core performance</a> for the most demanding tasks and workflows.<br/>
<br/>
Both the M2 Pro and M3 Pro are equipped with up to a 12-core CPU, but the M3 Pro has only six high-performance cores and six efficiency cores, while the M2 Pro has eight high-performance cores and four efficiency cores. So while the M3 Pro is manufactured with TSMC's 3nm process, compared to 5nm for the M2 Pro, the chip's resulting performance gains are diminished due to it having two fewer performance cores. The M3 Pro also has <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/31/apple-m3-pro-less-memory-bandwidth/">25% less memory bandwidth</a> and one fewer GPU core compared to the M2 Pro.<br/>
<br/>
By limiting the M3 Pro's number of high-performance cores, Apple has created more differentiation between the M3 Pro and the M3 Max, which has up to 12 high-performance cores. However, as a result, the M3 Pro is only marginally faster than the M2 Pro.<br/>
<br/>
Geekbench 6 results from earlier this week showed that the M3 Max is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/01/m3-max-chip-benchmark-results/">up to 45% faster than the M2 Max</a>, while the standard M3 chip is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/01/m3-chip-benchmark-results/">up to 20% faster than the standard M2 chip</a>, so the M3 Pro is by far the least improved chip of the series. Of course, the M3 Pro is still a significant upgrade for those coming from an Intel-based Mac. M3 Pro is also up to 20% faster than the M1 Pro chip, which is a decent improvement.<br/>
<br/>
As always, benchmarks provide a useful reference point, but real-world performance can vary.<br/>
<br/>
The new MacBook Pro models are available to order now, and M3 and M3 Pro configurations will begin arriving to customers and launch in stores on Tuesday, November 7. M3 Max configurations will launch later in November.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro/">MacBook Pro 14 & 16" </a></div><div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/geekbench/">Geekbench</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/benchmarks/">Benchmarks</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Pro_16">14" & 16" MacBook Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macbook-pro.90">MacBook Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/05/m3-pro-chip-benchmark-result/">M3 Pro Chip Barely Faster Than M2 Pro in Unverified Benchmark Result</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/m3-pro-chip-barely-faster-than-m2-pro-in-unverified-benchmark-result.2409903/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<title>watchOS Update Coming Soon With Fix for Apple Watch Battery Drain</title>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple is preparing a fix for an issue causing some Apple Watches to experience excessive battery drain after being updated to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/25/apple-releases-watchos-10-1/">watchOS 10.1</a>, the company said today in an internal memo shared with Apple Authorized Service Providers.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/04/watchOS-16x9.jpeg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-890854" /><br/>
In the memo, which <em>MacRumors</em> obtained from multiple sources, Apple said the issue will be fixed in a watchOS update that is "coming soon." Apple did not provide any additional details in the memo, so it is unclear what the underlying cause of the issue is, how many customers are affected, and if every Apple Watch model is impacted.<br/>
<br/>
There have been complaints about this issue from customers across the <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-releases-watchos-10-1-with-double-tap-namedrop-and-more.2408650/post-32666614">MacRumors Forums</a>, <a href="https://discussions.apple.com/thread/255241541">Apple Support Community</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/watchos/comments/17gpob9/101_battery_drain/">Reddit</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/Martin_J_Cooper/status/1720728159681704166">X</a> since watchOS 10.1 was released in late October. The issue seems to affect a variety of Apple Watches, ranging from older models like the Apple Watch Series 5 to the latest Apple Watch Ultra 2.<br/>
<br/>
"WatchOS 10.1 is killing the battery on my Apple Watch," wrote customer Martin Cooper on X. "100% to 50% in less than 60 mins."<br/>
<br/>
Apple's developer release notes for iOS 17.1 <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/ios-ipados-release-notes/ios-ipados-17_1-release-notes#Power">said</a> that update fixed an issue where "increased power consumption might occur" when an Apple Watch running watchOS 10.1 is paired with an iPhone running iOS 17, but evidently the Apple Watch battery drain issue has not been completely fixed, so a watchOS update will be necessary.<br/>
<br/>
<em>MacRumors</em> recently reported that Apple is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/02/ios-17-1-1-is-coming/">preparing to release iOS 17.1.1</a> for the iPhone, and it is likely that the Apple Watch battery drain issue will be fixed in a watchOS 10.1.1 update. However, it is possible that the fix might not arrive until watchOS 10.2, which is currently in beta testing and is expected to be released in December.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch/">Apple Watch Series 9</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch">Apple Watch (Buy Now)</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/04/watchos-update-to-fix-battery-drain-issue/">watchOS Update Coming Soon With Fix for Apple Watch Battery Drain</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/watchos-update-coming-soon-with-fix-for-apple-watch-battery-drain.2409877/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/competition/digital_markets_act/cases/202344/DMA_100027_197.pdf">recently claimed</a> that Safari is three different browsers in effort to avoid regulation in the European Union (via <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/11/02/apple_safari_browser/"><em>The Register</em></a>).<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/01/safari-icon-blue-banner.jpeg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-833485" /><br/>
The claim came as part of a <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/competition/digital_markets_act/cases/202344/DMA_100027_197.pdf">response</a> to the European Union in August, just before the European Commission designated many of Apple's iOS, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a>, and Safari as <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/06/app-store-safari-and-ios-designated-gatekeepers/">gatekeeper platforms</a>. This classification means that Apple now has to ensure that these platforms fall in line with the Digital Markets Act's requirements, such as allowing browser engines other than WebKit and the installation of third-party app stores.<br/>
<br/>
It has now emerged that after being informed that Safari was likely to fall under the DMA's regulations, Apple filed formal a response to the European Union claiming that Safari is, in fact, "three distinct web browsers." The company's claim is based on the argument that Safari for iOS, iPadOS, and macOS are entirely different and serve different purposes.<br/>
<br/>
On example cited by Apple is Safari's sidebar feature on iPadOS and macOS, allowing users to see opened tabs, tab groups, bookmarks, and browsing history. Since this feature is unavailable in the version of Safari for iOS, Apple claimed that it is a distinctly different browser. The company added that each version of Safari serves different purposes for users depending on the device upon which it is accessed.<br/>
<br/>
The European Commission went on to point out that Safari's functionality and underlying technologies are near-identical across platforms. The Commission even highlights Apple's own marketing materials for its Continuity feature, which appear to contradict the company's claims, touting the tag line "Same Safari. Different device." As a result, the Commission rejected Apple's claim and insists that "Safari qualifies as a single web browser, irrespective of the device through which that service is accessed."<br/>
<br/>
Apple is now obliged to ensure that Safari adheres to the DMA's requirements, such as by allowing non-WebKit-based browsers on iOS and iPadOS. Companies that do not adhere to the new regulations risk facing EU investigations, substantial fines, and the imposition of "behavioral or structural remedies." The fines can amount to 10 percent of a company's global turnover, with a 20 percent penalty for repeat violations. Questions remain about whether Apple's argument about Safari being three different browsers violates the DMA's Anti-Circumvention provision that forbids subdividing a platform's market share to avoid regulation. <div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/safari/">Safari</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/european-union/">European Union</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/european-commission/">European Commission</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/europe/">Europe</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/antitrust/">Apple Antitrust</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/04/apple-argued-safari-is-three-different-browsers/">Apple Argued Safari Is Three Different Browsers to Avoid Regulation</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-argued-safari-is-three-different-browsers-to-avoid-regulation.2409850/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's "Scary Fast" event this week went off about as expected, with Apple showing off its next-generation Mac chips in a couple of product lines during a fast-paced 30-minute presentation.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/top-stories-4nov2023.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-920863" /><br/>
Our biggest stories this week unsurprisingly delved into Apple's announcements including some early tidbits on the updated MacBook Pro and iMac, a goodbye to the Touch Bar, and more, so read on below for all the details!<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Everything Apple Announced During the 'Scary Fast' Event</h2><br/>
Trick or treat! Apple this week <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/30/everything-apple-announced-october-2023-event/">held its "Scary Fast" event</a>, focused entirely on the Mac. During the brief presentation, Apple announced new 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models with M3, M3 Pro, and M3 Max chips, and an updated iMac with the M3 chip.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/Everything-Announced-at-Scary-Fast-Thumb-1.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-919534" /><br/>
We've <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/30/everything-apple-announced-october-2023-event/">recapped everything that Apple announced during the event</a> for those who missed it or want to learn more.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Apple Announces New 14-Inch and 16-Inch MacBook Pro Models With M3 Series Chips</h2><br/>
The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/30/apple-announces-m3-macbook-pros/">new 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models are equipped with M3 Pro and M3 Max chips</a>, and there is now an entry-level 14-inch MacBook Pro available with the standard M3 chip as well.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/m3-mbp-space-black.jpg" alt="" width="1440" height="810" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-919466" /><br/>
The new MacBook Pro models are <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/31/space-black-macbook-pro-hands-on-videos/">available in a Space Black finish</a> when configured with the M3 Pro or M3 Max chip, and they are <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/30/new-macbook-pros-20-percent-brighter-displays/">equipped with 20% brighter displays</a> compared to the previous generation.<br/>
<br/>
The new MacBook Pro models are available to order now, and most configurations will launch on Tuesday, November 7.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Apple Announces New iMac With M3 Chip</h2><br/>
Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/30/apple-announces-imac-with-m3-chip/">updated the 24-inch iMac with the M3 chip</a> for up to 35% faster performance compared to the previous model with the M1 chip.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/m3-imac.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="902" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-919460" /><br/>
The all-in-one desktop computer features the same design and color options as the 2021 model. There are only a few other changes with the new iMac, including <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/30/imac-max-memory-wi-fi-6e/">Wi-Fi 6E and Bluetooth 5.3 support</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Contrary to rumors, the Magic Keyboard, Magic Mouse, and Magic Trackpad accessories <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/30/magic-accessories-still-feature-lightning/">still have Lightning instead of USB-C</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Apple Discontinues 13-Inch MacBook Pro With Touch Bar</h2><br/>
Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/30/apple-discontinues-13-inch-macbook-pro/">discontinued the 13-inch MacBook Pro following the event</a>, meaning that the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/31/touch-bar-discontinued/">Touch Bar has now been completely phased out</a> after seven years.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/06/13-inch-macbook-pro-2022-banner.jpeg" alt="" width="1100" height="619" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-850662" /><br/>
The first MacBook Pro models with the Touch Bar were released in October 2016, as part of a controversial redesign that also included a defective butterfly keyboard and the removal of many connectivity options, including an SD card slot, HDMI port, and MagSafe.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>First Benchmark Results Surface for M3 Chip in New Macs</h2><br/>
The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/01/m3-chip-benchmark-results/">first benchmark results for the standard M3 chip</a> and the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/01/m3-max-chip-benchmark-results/">high-end M3 Max chip</a> surfaced in the Geekbench 6 database after Apple's event, providing a closer look at CPU performance improvements.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/M3-Chip-Apple-Event-Slide.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="898" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-920110" /><br/>
The results show the M3 chip is around 20% faster than the M2 chip, while the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/01/m3-max-chip-benchmark-results/">M3 Max chip is around as fast as the M2 Ultra chip</a> that debuted in the Mac Pro and Mac Studio desktop computers earlier this year.<br/>

When this filter is toggled on, the other person's song choices won't affect your recommendations.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>iMessage: Contact Key Verification</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/12/Apple-advanced-security-iMessage-Contact-Key-Verification_screen-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-876653" /><br/>
iMessage Contact Key Verification allow users who face "extraordinary digital threats," such as journalists, human rights activists, and government officials, to further verify that they are messaging only with the people they intend. In conversations between users who have enabled iMessage Contact Key Verification, users are alerted if a state-sponsored attacker or other malicious actor were ever to succeed breaching cloud servers and inserting their own device to eavesdrop on the conversation.<br/>
<br/>
As an additional layer of security, iMessage Contact Key Verification users are able to compare a Contact Verification Code in person, on FaceTime, or through another secure call to further verify they are communicating only with whom they intend.<br/>
<br/>
Apple previewed iMessage Contact Key Verification in December 2022, and it is finally launching as part of iOS 17.2.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>iMessage: Sticker Reactions via Tapback Menu</h2><br/>

iOS 17.2 allows you to more quickly react to a message with any sticker by tapping "Add Sticker" in the Tapback menu in the Messages app.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Memoji: New Customization Options</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/ios-17-2-memoji-body.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-918895" /><br/>
Apple added a "Body" section for Memoji, allowing users to customize their Memoji character's waist, bust, shoulders, and arms.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Contact Posters: Rainbow Text</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/ios-17-2-contact-poster-rainbow.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-918893" /><br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Yesterday we shared the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/02/best-early-black-friday-apple-deals/">overall best early Black Friday deals</a> you can get three weeks ahead of the big shopping holiday on Friday, November 24. Today, we're focusing in on Apple's AirPods lineup and sharing the best early Black Friday deals you can get on AirPods, AirPods Pro, and AirPods Max.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/new-airpods-early-black-friday.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-920764" /><em><small>Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with some of these vendors. When you click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment, which helps us keep the site running.</small></em><br/>
<br/>
Of course, there is a chance that we could see better deals on AirPods arrive as Black Friday gets closer. This is a risk anyone has to take while shopping during the holidays, so with that in mind, many of the deals shared below are currently their best prices ever seen. More information on these sales can be found in our <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/black-friday/"><strong>Black Friday Roundup</strong></a>.<br/>

<br/>
Starting with the cheapest AirPods model, the AirPods 2 are available for <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB07PXGQC1Q%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"><strong>&#36;99.00</strong></a> on Amazon right now, down from &#36;129.00. As the oldest AirPods model in the lineup (from 2019), these may not be perfect for the audiophile on your list, but anyone wanting a simple and convenient pair of wireless earbuds will be happy.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB07PXGQC1Q%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"target="_blank"><div class="fancybutton"><div class="fancybadge">&#36;30 OFF</div>AirPods 2 for &#36;99.00</div></a></div><br/>
<br/>
Amazon has the AirPods 3 with Lightning Charging Case for <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0BDHB9Y8H%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"><strong>&#36;149.99</strong></a>, down from &#36;169.00. These are upgraded in a few ways from the AirPods 2, with spatial audio, Adaptive EQ, force sensor controls, sweat and water resistance, and more.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0BDHB9Y8H%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"target="_blank"><div class="fancybutton"><div class="fancybadge">&#36;19 OFF</div>AirPods 3 for &#36;149.99</div></a></div><br/>
<br/>
Moving to the Pro lineup, Amazon has the AirPods Pro 2 with Lightning/MagSafe Charging Case for <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0BDHWDR12%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"><strong>&#36;189.00</strong></a> and the AirPods Pro 2 with USB-C/MagSafe Charging Case is <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0CHWRXH8B%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"><strong>&#36;199.99</strong></a>. For the USB-C model, this is a second-best price and we expect a return of the &#36;189 price tag before the end of the month. <br/>
<br/>
The USB-C model was just released a few weeks ago and this is still a great price for the newest AirPods model. Because of this, as long as the two models are around the same price, we recommend going with the AirPods Pro 2 with USB-C over Lightning.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0CHWRXH8B%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"target="_blank"><div class="fancybutton"><div class="fancybadge">&#36;49 OFF</div>AirPods Pro 2 (USB-C) for &#36;199.99</div></a></div><br/>
<br/>
Lastly, the high-end AirPods Max are available for <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB08PZD76NP%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"><strong>&#36;479.99</strong></a> on Amazon, down from &#36;549.00. Discounts on the AirPods Max have been rare over the past few months, so this one is a second-best price on the over-ear headphones.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB08PZD76NP%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"target="_blank"><div class="fancybutton"><div class="fancybadge">&#36;69 OFF</div>AirPods Max for &#36;479.99</div></a></div><br/>

We talk through our candid feelings about the unusual Apple event and the way in which the company presented its latest devices. We look at the all-new M3, M3 Pro, and M3 Max chips, and weigh up the new MacBook Pro and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/">iMac</a>, who should consider upgrading to the next-generation machines, and more.

		<description><![CDATA[For this week's giveaway, we've once again <a href="https://www.lululook.com/">teamed up with Lululook</a> to offer <em>MacRumors</em> readers a chance to win an new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch-ultra/">Apple Watch Ultra 2</a> and one of <a href="https://www.lululook.com/collections/apple-watch-bands">Lululook's Titanium Apple Watch Bands</a> to go along with it.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-903372" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/07/lululook-modern-band-2.jpg" alt="" width="2655" height="1493" /><br/>
Lululook has range of high-quality titanium and carbon fiber Apple Watch bands that match the 49mm Apple Watch Ultra models, with the bands specifically for Apple's newest wrist-worn device. Lululook's bands are ideal for Apple Watch Ultra owners who are looking for a band option that is refined enough for the office and other situations where sportier bands don't quite work.<br/>

Lululook's <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0C4H44HQK%2F">Link Titanium Band</a> is the closest match to Apple's own stainless steel Link Bracelet, but in a titanium color that works better with the Apple Watch Ultra. The band has a secure closing mechanism, and at &#36;70, it's more affordable than the Link Bracelet.<br/>
<br/>

Lululook also has a version of the Link Titanium Band that comes with a <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0CKMK7VLH%2F">simpler magnetic clasping mechanism</a>. It's a bit more expensive at &#36;90, but the dual magnetic buckle is simple to get on and take off, plus the locking mechanism makes sure it stays on the wrist.<br/>
<br/>
The <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FLULULOOK-Titanium-Compatible-Apple-iWatch%2Fdp%2FB0C1GJLN9R">Modern Titanium Band</a> from Lululook is the company's most unique, and Lululook says that it was inspired by Iron Man. Available for &#36;37, this is the band that stands out the most of the bunch, so if you want a modern version of a titanium band it's worth checking out.<br/>
<br/>

Those looking for something unique might be interested in Lululook's &#36;80 <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FLULULOOK-Apple-Carbon-Magnetic-iWatch%2Fdp%2FB0BV29P1NY%2F">Carbon Fiber Apple Watch Band</a>, which is made of a lightweight carbon fiber material. Lululook says that it offers the light weight of plastic with the toughness of stainless steel for a comfortable fit. The watch has a magnetic band so it's easy to get on and off, and it can be customized to your size by removing links.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/carbon-fiber-apple-watch.jpg" alt="" width="970" height="600" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-920793" /><br/>
All of the bands from Lululook are made from lightweight titanium or carbon fiber material that is comfortable on the wrist and able to hold up to heavy use. Lululook says that the bands are waterproof and sweatproof, and because of the low weight of the material, the bands work for all-day use.<br/>
<br/>
The bands are 200mm in length and are adjustable by removing links, so Apple Watch owners can get a perfect fit. Titanium is lighter than steel, so Lululook says that these bands are lighter than Apple's own Link band, and that the material will resist scratches and corrosion. Lululook's full range of Apple Watch bands can be <a href="https://www.lululook.com/collections/apple-watch-bands">found on the Lululook website</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Lululook also manufactures a range of charging accessories designed for the Apple Watch. The &#36;70 <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0CGVFKM5M%2F">Lululook 3-in-1 Wireless Charger</a> works with the Apple Watch, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>, and AirPods, and can charge all three at once. The foldable design is convenient for travel, and it works with <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe-battery-pack/">MagSafe</a> and accommodates StandBy mode. The Apple Watch and AirPods can charge at 5W, while the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; can charge at 7.5W.<br/>
<br/>

If you just need to charge the Apple Watch and an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;, Lululook has a super small &#36;50 <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FLULULOOK-Wireless-Ultra-Nano-Portable-Charging%2Fdp%2FB0CDWJTXPP%2F">Ultra Nano 2-in-1 Charger</a> that's perfect for travel. It has a magnetic charging puck for the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; and an upright charger for the Apple Watch, and it folds up when not in use. Lululook has a special deal on this charger right now, with a 40 percent discount available.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today indicated that its extended return policy is now in effect for the 2023 holiday shopping season. The policy applies to most products that Apple sells, including the iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple Watch, accessories, and more.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/iPhone-Boxes-16x9.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-920850" /><br/>
In the U.S., Canada, U.K., Australia, New Zealand, Germany, France, the Netherlands, Singapore, and many other countries, most products purchased between November 3 and December 25 of this year may be returned through January 8, 2024, <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/help/returns_refund">according to Apple's website</a>. All purchases made after December 25 are subject to Apple's standard 14-day return policy.<br/>
<br/>
In some countries, the return window is slightly longer. In Italy, Spain, Turkey, Mexico, and Japan, Apple says most products purchased between November 3, 2023 and January 6, 2024 may be returned through January 20, 2024.<br/>
<br/>
Apple has also updated its <a href="https://www.apple.com/store">online "Store" page</a> with gift recommendations for the holidays.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-store/">Apple Store</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/03/apple-2023-holiday-return-policy/">Apple&#039;s Extended Return Policy Now in Effect for 2023 Holiday Season</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apples-extended-return-policy-now-in-effect-for-2023-holiday-season.2409763/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The MacBook Pro is available in 14-inch and 16-inch sizes, with three distinct models starting at &#36;1,599, &#36;1,999, and &#36;2,499, so which should you choose?<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/01/m2-macbook-pro-pink.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-881970" /><br/>
With a range of three similar models in the lineup to choose from, our guide helps to answer the question of how to decide which of these MacBook Pros is best for you. The three models are as follows:<br/>
<br/>
<ul><br/>
<li><strong>14-Inch MacBook Pro with M3</strong>: An entry-level model for users who need a machine that is more powerful and versatile than the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/">MacBook Air</a>.</li><br/>
<li><strong>14-Inch MacBook Pro with M3 Pro or M3 Max</strong>: A more powerful, high-end model with a choice of performance-focused chips. It comes with one extra Thunderbolt port, higher memory bandwidth, larger quantities of memory, support for additional external displays, an 8TB storage option, and a Space Black color option, but loses four hours of battery life and the Space Gray color option.</li><br/>
<li><strong>16-Inch MacBook Pro with M3 Pro or M3 Max</strong>: A model with identical specifications to the 14-inch model with the M3 Pro or M3 Max chips, but with a significantly larger display and four extra hours of battery life. It also gains High Power Mode to boost performance, but loses the ability to fast charge via USB-C.</li><br/>
</ul><br/>
<br/>
Each MacBook Pro is configurable to add more a more powerful processor and larger quantities of memory and storage. Read on for a detailed break down of all of the differences between the three MacBook Pro models.<br/>

<br/>
<h3 id="display_size">Display Size</h3><br/>
The MacBook Pro is offered in 14.2-inch and 16.2-inch display sizes. The 16.2-inch display is a better replacement for a desktop machine and provides much more screen space to arrange multiple windows and use professional applications that benefit from the additional display area. The 14.2-inch display is still larger than the 13.3-inch &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; and MacBook Pro models from recent years, and will likely be the best overall balance of needs for most users.<br/>
<br/>
While the "notch" containing the webcam does eat into the display space very slightly, both displays are larger than MacBook Pro models from before 2021, so there is still more display area overall. In addition, the display area below the notch has an aspect ratio of exactly 16:10, just like previous MacBook Pro models, to ensure that the notch does not impede normal display views or watching media. On this basis, if you are concerned about the notch, you should not necessarily feel obliged to get the larger, 16-inch MacBook Pro. That being said, since the notch is the same size on both models, it may be slightly less noticeable on the 16-inch model.<br/>
<br/>
<h3 id="design">Design</h3><br/>
The 16-inch model is, of course, physically larger than the 14-inch model, with a markedly bigger overall footprint. It is also worth noting that the 16-inch model is also 0.13 cm thicker and up to 1.4 pounds (0.64 kg) heavier. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2013/09/macbook-pro-sizes.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1055" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-821775" /><br/>
The 14-inch MacBook Pro is decidedly more portable and comfortable than the 16-inch model to carry around on a daily basis. Though the 16-inch MacBook Pro can still fit in larger bags and is an acceptable size for travel, it is a much bigger, heavier machine. If you are considering the 16-inch MacBook Pro, you should make sure you are comfortable with its size and weight – especially if you plan to use it on the go.<br/>
<br/>
Models with the M3 Pro and M3 Max chips are available in a new Space Black finish, so if you want this color option, you must ensure that you are buying one of the more powerful machines.<br/>
<br/>
<h3 id="chip_configurations">Chip Configurations</h3><br/>
Both the 14-inch and 16-inch models are equally upgradeable to the M3 Max chip with a 16-core CPU and 40-core GPU, but if you are looking to spend as little as possible or do not need a high level of performance for intense workflows the 14-inch MacBook Pro is also available with the standard M3 chip. The M3 offers a more balanced processor with more of a focus on efficiency to prolong battery life, which will be more appropriate for users with less demanding requirements. Buyers should be aware that the M3 chip is limited to 100GB/s memory bandwidth, 24GB of memory, 2TB storage, and supports just one external display.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/07/Apple-M3-chip-series.jpg" alt="" width="3840" height="2160" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-920046" /><br/>
We do not yet have a full set of <a href="https://browser.geekbench.com/mac-benchmarks">Geekbench benchmarks</a> for the new MacBook Pro models, but the below table gives an early sense of the performance differences that we're aware of so far:<br/>
<br/>
<table class="comparison"><br/>
 <tr><br/>
 <th></th><br/>
 <th>Single-Core</th><br/>
 <th>Multi-Core</th><br/>
 </tr><br/>
 <tr><br/>
 <th>M3</th><br/>
 <td>~3,140</td><br/>
 <td>~11,990</td><br/>
 </tr><br/>
 <tr><br/>
 <th>M3 Pro</th><br/>
 <td>TBC (~3,185 likely)</td><br/>
 <td>TBC (>14,300 likely)</td><br/>
 </tr><br/>
 <tr><br/>
 <th>M3 Max</th><br/>

 <td>~21,560</td><br/>
 </tr><br/>
 </tr><br/>
</table><br/>
<div class="clear"></div><br/>
<br/>
The base configuration of the 14-inch MacBook Pro features an M3 Pro with 11-core CPU and 14-core GPU, while the base 16-inch model contains an M3 Pro with 12-core CPU and 18-core GPU. If you upgrade the 14-inch model to the same M3 Pro with 12-core CPU and 18-core GPU that the 16-inch model starts with, it increases to &#36;2,299 – just &#36;200 less than the starting price of the 16-inch model.<br/>
<br/>
For those who are leaning toward buying the 16-inch MacBook Pro and want the M3 Pro with 12-core CPU and 18-core GPU at a minimum, the slimmer price difference between the two models to just &#36;200 may make it easier to justify getting the larger machine. On the other hand, if you do not need the performance of the M3 Pro with 12-core CPU and 18-core GPU, the 16-inch model may be overkill, and getting the 14-inch model will be the best way to keep costs down.<br/>
<br/>
<h3 id="high_power_mode">High Power Mode</h3><br/>
The 16-inch MacBook Pro with the M3 Max chip offers a software feature called High Power Mode. When enabled, High Power Mode boosts the machine's performance to better meet the needs of intensive, sustained workloads.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/10/high-power-mode-macos.jpg" alt="" width="1578" height="1010" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-822840" /><br/>
High Power Mode is designed to optimize and improve performance for resource-intensive tasks, such as color grading 8K ProRes video, according to Apple. When enabled, High Power Mode will de-prioritize resource-hungry system processes in order to leverage the full performance capability of the ‌M3 Max chip. The setting is effectively the opposite of "Low Power Mode," which aims to decrease system performance in favor of prolonging battery life.<br/>
<br/>
<ul><li><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/high-power-mode-macbook-pro/">How to Use High Power Mode on 16-inch MacBook Pro</a></li></ul><br/>
<br/>
The 14-inch MacBook Pro does not feature High Power Mode, so if you want the ability to selectively push the M3 Max chip to its limits, you will need to buy the 16-inch model.<br/>
<br/>
<h3 id="battery_life">Battery Life</h3><br/>
Owing to its larger size, the 16-inch MacBook Pro contains a larger battery and has longer-lasting battery life. The 14-inch model contains a 70- or 72.4-watt-hour battery, while the 16-inch model contains a 100-watt-hour battery.<br/>
<br/>
Apple says the M3 14-inch MacBook Pro can deliver up to 22 hours of battery life when playing back video, but this drops to 18-hours when configured with the M3 Pro or M3 Max. The 16-inch model adds four hours for 22-hour battery life when playing back video. For users who need maximum battery life, the M3 14-inch model or any of the 16-inch configurations will be the best option. That being said, the M3 Pro and M3 Max 14-inch model's 18-hour battery life is still good enough for most users.<br/>
<br/>
<h3 id="charging">Charging</h3><br/>
The 14-inch MacBook Pro uses a 70W or 96W USB-C power adapter for charging, while the 16-inch model comes with a 140W power adapter. Both models support fast charging, but a 96W or higher USB-C power adapter is required. The 96W USB-C power adapter is a &#36;20 option on the base model 14-inch MacBook Pro, but it comes as standard with M3 Pro configurations with a 12-core CPU and ones with the M3 Max.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/10/macbook-pro-magsafe-3-charging.jpg" alt="" width="1960" height="1274" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-821241" /><br/>
Both models can use the &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; 3 port to fast charge, but it is also possible to fast charge the 14-inch model using one of its USB-C/Thunderbolt 4 ports. If you require the flexibility of being able to fast charge via USB-C, you will need to buy the 14-inch model to have this functionality.<br/>
<br/>
It is worth noting that both the 14- and the 16-inch models can charge with up to 100W via their USB-C ports, but since the 16-inch model has a larger battery, it is not classified as "fast charging" on this machine.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="final_thoughts">Final Thoughts</h2><br/>
The 16-inch MacBook Pro is &#36;500 more than the 14-inch model with the base M3 Pro chip, so you should be sure that you need the additional display area, battery life, and perhaps even High Power Mode support to justify its higher price. That being said, if you upgrade the 14-inch model to the same M3 Pro with 12-core CPU and 18-core GPU that the 16-inch model starts with, the price difference shrinks to &#36;200, and it may be worth opting for the larger model – especially if you could take advantage of its longer battery life.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/10/macbook-pro-2021-side-by-side.jpeg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-821178" /><br/>
Buyers of the 16-inch model should be aware that it is considerably larger, thicker, and heavier than the 14-inch model, to the extent that it could be needlessly cumbersome to some users. The 14-inch MacBook Pro is clearly a more portable machine, so if you intend to carry your MacBook Pro around frequently or need the versatility of it easily fitting into a bag for transport, the smaller model is the better option by far.<br/>
<br/>
If you need more than 8GB of memory and are interested in the 14-inch model with the M3 chip, a 16GB memory configuration pushes the price up to &#36;1,799. The 14-inch MacBook Pro with the M3 Pro chip has 18GB of memory as standard and starts at &#36;1,999. In this case, it is likely worth spending the extra &#36;200 to gain one extra Thunderbolt port, three extra CPU cores, four extra GPU cores, two more gigabytes of memory, and Space Black color option, unless you are particularly concerned about losing two hours of battery life.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro/">MacBook Pro 14 & 16" </a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Pro_16">14" & 16" MacBook Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macbook-pro.90">MacBook Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/14-inch-vs-16-inch-macbook-pro/">Late 2023 MacBook Pro Buyer&#039;s Guide: 14-Inch and 16-Inch Models Compared</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/late-2023-macbook-pro-buyers-guide-14-inch-and-16-inch-models-compared.2317972/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[While it was rumored that the iPhone 15 Pro models <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/10/28/kuo-iphone-15-pro-models-solid-state-buttons/">would be equipped with solid-state buttons</a>, the devices ended up launching with traditional mechanical buttons. Attention has now shifted to whether the solid-state buttons will still happen with the iPhone 16 lineup next year, but there are conflicting rumors so far, as outlined below.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/iPhone-16-Side-2-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="3532" height="1986" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-913688" /><br/>
For context, solid-state buttons would provide haptic feedback when pressed to simulate the feeling of movement, similar to the Home button on the iPhone SE and the Force Touch trackpad on modern MacBooks. On the other hand, mechanical buttons actually move when pressed. All of the buttons on the iPhone 15 Pro models are mechanical, including the new Action button that provides quick access to an assigned function.<br/>
<br/>
Benefits of solid-state buttons could include fewer mechanical parts that can break and improved water resistance. Solid-state buttons could also potentially sit flush with the iPhone's frame, allowing for a more seamless design.<br/>
<br/>
Multiple analysts and a leaker claimed that Apple had tested solid-state buttons on prototype iPhone 15 Pro models, but the company apparently decided not to move forward with the change before mass production started <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/11/kuo-iphone-15-pro-no-solid-state-buttons-after-all/">due to "technical issues."</a><br/>
<br/>
Apple supplier Cirrus Logic seemingly confirmed that the solid-state buttons <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/05/iphone-15-pro-solid-state-buttons-cancellation/">had been canceled earlier this year</a>, and it has seemingly touched on the topic again. In a <a href="https://s21.q4cdn.com/307563939/files/doc_financials/2024/q2/Q2-FY24-Shareholder-Letter_Final.pdf">shareholder letter this week</a>, the supplier shared the following information:<blockquote>Finally, during the quarter we completed the disposition of wafers associated with a new high-performance mixed-signal (HPMS) product that was previously expected to ship this year. As anticipated, the disposition did not have a material financial impact.</blockquote>In an email, an equity research analyst at British bank Barclays informed us that Cirrus Logic disposed of these wafers due to Apple canceling the solid-state buttons on the iPhone 15 Pro models. The devices were expected to have additional Taptic Engines that provided haptic feedback when the buttons were pressed, and Cirrus Logic was expected to supply Apple with haptic drivers that would have enabled this functionality.<br/>
<br/>
The analyst also told us that they do not expect iPhone 16 models to be equipped with solid-state buttons, given that Cirrus Logic has disposed of its related inventory for the project, but <em>MacRumors</em> contributor Marko Zivkovic believes otherwise. Last month, Zivkovic reported that the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/25/iphone-16-capture-button/">entire iPhone 16 lineup will be equipped with solid-state Action and "Capture" buttons</a>. The purpose of the "Capture" button remains unknown, and he cautioned that Apple's plans could once again change as development progresses.<br/>
<br/>
Zivkovic said the "Capture" button would be located below the power button on the right side of the iPhone 16 models, should it materialize. As a result, he said the mmWave 5G antenna window on iPhone 16 models sold in the U.S. would be moved to the left side of the devices, below the volume buttons. This rumor was <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/31/iphone-16-extra-button-rumor/">seemingly corroborated</a> this week by a leaker on Chinese social media platform Weibo, but it is unclear if the account independently confirmed the information, or if it was simply repeating the details shared by Zivkovic.<br/>
<br/>
All in all, rumors about solid-state buttons for the iPhone 16 lineup do not align right now, with some sources expecting them and others not. As the launch of the devices next September draws closer, Apple's plans should become clearer.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/barclays/">Barclays</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/03/will-iphone-16-feature-taptic-buttons/">Will the iPhone 16 Feature Taptic Buttons?</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/will-the-iphone-16-feature-taptic-buttons.2409756/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[In iOS 17.2, you can turn off your <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/">Apple Music</a> Listening History with a new Focus filter, so if you allow someone else to use your device to listen to music, you can quickly activate the Focus with a tap and prevent their song choices from affecting your recommendations. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/08/iOS-17-Apple-Music-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2250" height="1266" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-907547" /><br/>
Have you ever regretted letting a friend or family member use &zwnj;Apple Music&zwnj; on your <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> after their poor song choices negatively influenced your personal music recommendations? <br/>
<br/>
If you have very young kids, the chances are that at some point you've played their favorite preschooler ditty to avoid a meltdown, only to later cringe when Apple's algorithms slip "Baby Shark" or some other infuriatingly repetitive song into your recently played/replay mixes. <br/>
<br/>
Thankfully, Apple has finally become aware of the regularity of such events, and in iOS 17.2, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/26/ios-17-2-beta-1-features/">currently in beta</a>, it has added a new Focus filter option that can help you automatically turn off your &zwnj;Apple Music&zwnj; listening history whenever you give up your device to those with, shall we say, more acquired listening tastes.<br/>
<br/>
The following steps show you how it's done. Note that you'll need to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/download-ios-17-beta-iphone/">download the iOS 17.2 beta</a> for this to work, otherwise you won't see the Listening History filter option. <br/>
<ol><li>Go to <strong>Settings ➝ Focus</strong> on your &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;.</li><br/>
<li>Tap the <strong>+</strong> button in the top-right corner to create a new Focus, then tap <strong>Custom</strong>.</li><br/>
<li>Give your new Focus an identifiable name, symbol, and color, then tap <strong>Next</strong>.<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/apple-music-listening-history-focus2.jpg" alt="focus" width="4137" height="2716" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-920452" /><br/>
<li>Tap <strong>Customize Focus</strong>.</li><br/>
<li>Scroll down to "Focus Filters," ten tap <strong>Add Filter</strong>.</li><br/>
<li>Choose the <strong>Music</strong> filter.</li><br/>
<li>Make sure the button is off next to <strong>Use Listening History</strong>, then tap <strong>Add</strong>.<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/apple-music-listening-history-focus1.jpg" alt="focus" width="4137" height="2716" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-920453" /></ol>That's all there is to it. The next time music is going to be played for someone else on your &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;, simply swipe down from the top-right corner of the screen to bring up Control Center and long press on the Focus button to select the Focus you created. Rest assured that whatever they play after that, won't play havoc with your &zwnj;Apple Music&zwnj; algorithms.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, if you don't feel like you benefit from &zwnj;Apple Music&zwnj;'s personal recommendations, and you don't have an &zwnj;Apple Music&zwnj; profile where your listening history is shared, you can disable Listening History more permanently by going to <strong>Settings ➝ Music</strong> and toggling off the switch next to <strong>Use Listening History</strong>.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/">Apple Music</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/apple-music-listening-history-focus-filter/">How to Stop Your Kids From Ruining Your Apple Music Recommendations</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/how-to-stop-your-kids-from-ruining-your-apple-music-recommendations.2409735/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple in October <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/30/everything-apple-announced-october-2023-event/">announced</a> an M3-powered 24-inch iMac, as well as new 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models with M3 series chips. So when will the rest of Apple's Mac lineup be updated to the latest M3 processors, and will they be worth the wait?<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/When-Will-Apple-Launch-More-M3-Macs-Feature-Sans-13inch-MBP.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-920524" /><br/>
Now that Apple's "Scary Fast" event has passed, attention naturally turns to the other Macs in the company's lineup and where they might fit into Apple's M3 roadmap. Here's what the latest rumors say.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>M3 MacBook Air</h2><br/>
Apple sells three versions of MacBook Air: A cheaper previous-generation 13-inch model with M1 chip, and 13-inch and 15-inch models equipped with the newer M2 chip. The question is, when will Apple discontinue the M1 MacBook Air and replace its top-of-the-line 13-inch and 15-inch machines with M3 equivalents?<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/M3-MacBook-Air-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-920517" /><br/>
<br/>
The existing 15-inch MacBook Air arrived earlier this year in June, which is not that long ago in terms of Mac update cycles. However, Apple released the M2 13-inch ‌MacBook Air back in June 2022. It is now the oldest Mac in Apple's current crop, having not been updated in over 480 days.<br/>
<br/>
According to <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman, Apple has 13-inch and 15-inch M3 MacBook Air models in development, and both are said to be scheduled for release sometime in the <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-10-27/apple-october-30-scary-fast-event-new-imacs-macbook-pros-products-to-expect">first half of 2024</a>. Both models are said to have reached <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/16/four-new-macbooks-on-schedule-for-launch-in-2024/">engineering verification testing (EVT)</a>, an early production testing phase on prototype devices. The M3 chip used in the Airs is expected to have similar CPU and GPU core counts as the M2 chip in the current models.<br/>
<br/>
Given so much time has elapsed since the current 13-inch MacBook Air was launched, it might seem safe to assume this model will be the next beneficiary in line for Apple's M3 chip. However, Apple's roadmap for Apple silicon appears to be partly dictated by supplier production capacity, so we could see either one model launched first or both 13-inch and 15-inch models launched in tandem.<br/>
<br/>
Gurman says the next-generation MacBook Airs are on schedule for launch between the spring and summer of next year at the earliest, which could also mirror the time frame of the current models' launches that took place at WWDC in June 2022 and 2023.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Mac Mini</h2><br/>
Apple announced M2 and M2 Pro Mac mini models in January, just over 280 days ago, but Apple could be already testing an M3 Mac mini, according to Gurman.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/M3-Mac-Mini-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-920522" /><br/>
<br/>
In August, signs of an unknown "15,12" Mac machine were <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/07/apple-testing-mac-mini-m3/">found in developer code</a>, with the Mac featuring an 8-core CPU (consisting of four efficiency cores and four performance cores), 10-core GPU, and 24GB RAM. Based on the similar specifications to the base M2 Mac mini (bar the existing model's 8GB RAM as standard), Gurman believes it represents a next-generation Mac mini.<br/>
<br/>
Gurman <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/07/23/new-macbook-pro-and-mac-mini-with-m3-2024-launch/">previously said</a> he was not expecting an M3 version of the Mac mini to launch until late 2024, but as it is already in testing, it could potentially be unveiled sooner.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Mac Studio, Mac Pro</h2><br/>
Apple updated the ‌Mac Studio and Mac Pro with M2 series chips in June of this year. Mac Studio models come with either the M2 Max or M2 Ultra chip, while the Mac Pro has adopted the M2 Ultra.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/M3-Mac-Pro-and-Studio-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-920519" /><br/>
<br/>
Both Macs are considered to be in the middle of their product cycles, and there are as yet no reliable rumors about when more powerful M3 versions of either machines will be launched. But if Apple is committed to an annual upgrade cycle, we could see them in June 2024. <br/>
<br/>
<h2>13-inch MacBook Pro</h2><br/>
Apple has <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/30/apple-discontinues-13-inch-macbook-pro/">discontinued</a> the 13-inch M2 MacBook Pro – and along with it the Touch Bar – replacing it with a 14-inch model that's equipped with a next-generation M3 chip. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/No-M3-MacBook-Pro-13-Inch-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-920518" /><br/>
<br/>
Apple says that the 14-inch M3 MacBook Pro is up to 60 percent faster than the 13-inch MacBook Pro with M1. The M3 14-inch MacBook Pro also comes with a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/01/m3-macbook-pro-comparison/">number of other benefits</a> that make it worth the upgrade for anyone with the original 13-inch machine. So do not expect to see an M3-powered 13-inch MacBook Pro anytime soon, if ever.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>M3 Performance Gains to Expect</h2><br/>
The M3 series of chips are built on TSMC's 3-nanometer process, bringing performance and efficiency improvements over Apple's previous M2 chips, which are based on the earlier-generation 5-nanometer process. <br/>
<br/>
The actual real-world gains depend on the M3 processor version, coupled with the particular Mac model and other component factors like RAM and thermal dissipation. Nevertheless, all of Apple's M3 chips also boast GPU improvements not found in the M2 series, including Dynamic Caching, hardware-accelerated ray tracing, and hardware-accelerated mesh shading.<br/>
<br/>
<h3>M3</h3><br/>
Apple's base M3 chip will likely feature in future MacBook Air models, as well as an updated lower-end version of the Mac mini. At least in the MacBook Airs, the M3 chip is expected to have similar CPU and GPU core counts as the M2 chip in the current models, but that could be true for the Mac mini as well.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/M3-Chip-Apple-Event-Slide.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="898" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-920110" /><br/>
Based on early benchmarks, the M3 chip has single-core and multi-core scores of around 3,000 and 11,700, respectively. The standard M2 chip has single-core and multi-core scores of around 2,600 and 9,700, respectively, so the M3 chip is up to 20% faster than the M2 chip, which is what Apple claimed during its "Scary Fast" event in October.<br/>
<br/>
<h3>M3 Pro</h3><br/>
It's not yet clear what performance gains to expect from the M3 Pro chip compared to the previous M2 Pro generation, but it is likely to be relatively minor. Bear in mind that when Apple announced the M3 series, the only slide that it didn't show is how much faster the M3 Pro is than the equivalent M2 chip.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/m3-pro-chip.jpg" alt="" width="5104" height="2868" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-919649" /><br/>
<br/>
The M3 Pro and M2 Pro chips in the 16-inch MacBook Pro have 12 CPU cores, but the M2 Pro actually features one additional GPU core over the M3 Pro. Despite that, Apple claims it is 10 percent faster than the M2 Pro GPU and 40 percent faster than the M1 Pro GPU. <br/>
<br/>
<h3>M3 Max</h3><br/>
Early benchmarks indicate that Apple's new M3 Max chip in the 16-inch MacBook Pro is around as fast as the M2 Ultra chip used in the current-generation Mac Pro and the higher-end Mac Studio. In other words, the M2 Ultra Mac Pro is being outperformed by what is on paper a lower-end machine, just four months after it was released.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/M3-Max-Chip.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="895" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-920348" /><br/>
Note that the new 16-inch MacBook Pro starts at &#36;3,499 in the U.S. when configured with the M3 Max chip, while the Mac Studio with the M2 Ultra chip starts at &#36;3,999, so you can effectively get the same performance for &#36;500 less by buying the new 16-inch MacBook Pro, which also includes a display, keyboard, and trackpad. <br/>
<br/>
Will this performance imbalance alone encourage Apple to bring forward the launch of M3-powered Mac Studio and Mac Pro models? Unlikely. But we can always hope. <br/>
<br/>
<h3>M3 Ultra</h3><br/>
Having not yet been announced, the M3 Ultra chip is something of an unknown quantity. However, given that the existing M2 Ultra encompasses two M2 Max chips for double overall CPU and GPU performance, as well as twice the memory bandwidth (800GB/s), expect similar performance gains over the M3 Max from Apple's next-generation high-end M3 Ultra chip.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m3/">M3</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/03/when-apple-launch-more-m3-macs/">These M3 Macs Are Still Coming, But Are They Worth the Wait?</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/these-m3-macs-are-still-coming-but-are-they-worth-the-wait.2409726/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's embrace of titanium for its latest iPhone 15 Pro chassis appears to have impressed Samsung enough that the Korean rival plans to adopt the material for the next version of its flagship smartphone.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/1technizo-concept-ultra-s24.jpeg" alt="" width="2048" height="1152" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-920643" /><div class="center-wrap"><em>Samsung S24 Ultra concept render by <a href="https://x.com/technizoconcept/status/1719577996061978810?s=46">Technizo Concept</a></em></div><br/>
The Galaxy S24 Ultra will be the first Samsung phone to use titanium and the company intends to expand the application depending on users' reception, according to <em><a href="https://www.thelec.net/news/articleView.html?idxno=4672">The Elec</a></em>.<br/>
<br/>
For the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max, Apple is using a new titanium frame rather than a stainless steel frame, which cuts down on weight. The iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max are approximately nine percent lighter than the iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max. <br/>
<br/>
The iPhone 15 Pro weighs 187 grams, down from 206 grams for the iPhone 14 Pro, while the iPhone 15 Pro Max weighs 221 grams, down from 240 grams for the iPhone 14 Pro Max. <br/>
<br/>
According to the report, Samsung's adoption of titanium for the S24 Ultra is unlikely to lead to an equivalent weight reduction compared to the S23 Ultra, since Samsung currently uses light aluminum in its flagship devices, whereas Apple previously used heavier but more durable stainless steel.<br/>
<br/>
According to <em>The Elec</em>'s sources, Samsung has been mulling using titanium cases for around two years, although the decision to go ahead with its commercializtion only came recently – but not without cost. Titanium is widely used in the aerospace sector. However, it is more difficult to handle in cutting and processing, and its low heat conductivity makes it harder to cut cleanly. <br/>
<br/>
Samsung is therefore bracing itself for lower yield rates, which will push up the price of the frames. The aluminum cases in the company's premium phones currently cost less than &#36;20, while titanium versions could cost up to &#36;100, according to the report. Samsung is said to have "tentatively" set a goal to make 15 million frame units – the same number of Galaxy S23 Ultra models it shipped this year.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/samsung/">Samsung</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/03/samsung-follows-iphone-15-pro-titanium-galaxy-s24/">Samsung to Follow iPhone 15 Pro and Use Titanium for Galaxy S24 Ultra</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/samsung-to-follow-iphone-15-pro-and-use-titanium-for-galaxy-s24-ultra.2409722/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today held an earnings call for the fourth fiscal quarter of 2023 (third calendar quarter), with Apple CEO <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tim-cook/">Tim Cook</a> and Apple CFO Luca Maestri sharing details on recent product sales, services growth, Apple's future plans, and more.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-834994" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/01/Apple-Logo-Cash-Feature-Yellow.jpg" alt="" width="2676" height="1504" /><br/>
We've highlighted the most interesting takeaways from Apple's earnings call.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Services</h2><br/>
Apple's quarterly revenue was down one percent year over year at &#36;89.5 billion, but services revenue hit a new all-time revenue record. Services revenue was &#36;22.3 billion, up 16 percent from &#36;19.2 billion in the year-ago quarter.<br/>
<br/>
Across all of 2023, Apple's services category brought in &#36;85 billion, up from &#36;78 billion in 2022.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a>, advertising, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/icloud/">iCloud</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/applecare/">AppleCare</a>, payment services, and video hit all-time revenue records, while <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/">Apple Music</a> saw an all-time revenue record for the September quarter.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>iPhone Sales</h2><br/>
<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> revenue was up during the quarter, coming in at &#36;43.8 billion, up from &#36;42.6 billion in the year-ago quarter. &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; revenue was down for the year, though, at &#36;200.6 billion, down from &#36;205.5 billion last year.<br/>
<br/>
Apple's &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; revenue set a September quarter revenue record.<br/>
<br/>
According to Apple CEO &zwnj;Tim Cook&zwnj;, the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a> models sold better than the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-14/">iPhone 14</a> models, but supplies of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a> and Pro Max were constrained, which impacted Apple's total &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; revenue.<br/>
<br/>
Cook said that Apple is "working hard" to make more &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; and Pro Max devices, and that the company expects to reach supply/demand balance at the end of the holiday quarter. &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; revenue is expected to grow year-over-year in the December quarter.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Mac Sales</h2><br/>
Mac sales <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/02/mac-revenue-down-m3-sales-improvements/">were way down</a> in Q4 2023, with Macs bringing in &#36;7.6 billion, down 34 percent &#36;11.5 billion in the year-ago quarter. Mac revenue for all of 2023 was &#36;29.4 billion, down from &#36;40.2 billion in 2022.<br/>
<br/>
Last year, September Mac sales were up because of supply chain issues in June, a situation that Apple could not compete with this year. Cook expects Mac revenue to improve next quarter thanks to the October introduction of the M3 Macs, and he said that the negative 34 percent growth should not be seen as representative of the underlying performance of the Mac.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>iPad Sales</h2><br/>
<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> sales did not fare quite as badly as Mac sales, but &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; revenue was also down. The &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; category brought in &#36;6.4 billion, down from &#36;7.1 billion in the year-ago quarter. Apple has not released any new iPads this year, so the drop in &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; revenue does not come as a surprise.<br/>
<br/>
Across 2023, &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; revenue came in at &#36;28.3 billion, down from &#36;29.3 billion in 2022. Apple CFO Luca Maestri said that year over year performance for the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; will "decelerate significantly" because of changes in product launch timing. Apple last year launched a new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a> during the December quarter, and no new iPads are planned in 2023.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Wearables, Home and Accessories</h2><br/>
Wearables revenue dropped as well, coming in at &#36;9.32 billion for the quarter, down from &#36;9.65 billion in the year-ago quarter. Wearable revenue for 2022 was at &#36;39.9 billion, down from &#36;41.2 billion last year.<br/>
<br/>
Year over year revenue for the wearables category is expected to drop in the December quarter.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Research and Development Spending</h2><br/>
Apple spent a total of &#36;30 billion on research and development in 2023, up from &#36;26.3 billion in 2022. Apple CEO &zwnj;Tim Cook&zwnj; said that Apple's increased spending is due to Vision Pro, AI, machine learning, and silicon investments.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Active Install Base</h2><br/>
Apple CFO Luca Maestri said that Apple's active installed base of devices has hit a new all-time high across all products and all of Apple's geographic segments.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Vision Pro</h2><br/>
Apple CEO &zwnj;Tim Cook&zwnj; was asked whether he thinks the Vision Pro launch and consumer education process will ultimately be similar to the AirPods and Apple Watch, but he said no, because of the purchasing experience.<blockquote>"I would say no. There's never been a product like the Vision Pro, so we're purposely bringing it out in our stores only so we can really put a great deal of attention on the last mile of it. We'll be offering demos in the stores and it'll be a very different process than a normal grab-and-go kind of process."</blockquote>Cook went on to say that Apple is seeing a "tremendous amount of excitement around Vision Pro." Cook has tested some of the apps that developers are working on, and he claims that some "real blow away kind of things are coming out."<br/>
<br/>
The Vision Pro will be sold solely in the United States to begin with, and Cooks comments suggest that customers might be required to visit a retail store to make a purchase. Apple's Vision Pro website says that the headset will be available for purchase both online and in retail stores, but Apple could ask customers to come to a retail store to pick up an online purchase in order to ensure a proper fit.<br/>
<br/>
<em>Bloomberg</em>'s <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a> <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/22/apple-to-host-secretive-vision-pro-training-event/">recently said</a> that Apple will assemble Vision Pro headsets for customers in its stores, giving each user the appropriate headband, light seal, and prescription lenses if necessary.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Generative AI</h2><br/>
Cook was asked how Apple might be able to monetize generative AI, which he of course declined to comment on, but he said that Apple is "investing quite a bit" in AI and that there are going to be product advancements <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/02/tim-cook-generative-ai-comments/">that involve generative AI</a> in the future.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Apple silicon</h2><br/>
An analyst asked Cook if it would ever be feasible for Apple to purchase "from the industry." Cook said that Apple silicon is "at the heart of the primary technologies" that Apple likes to control in its devices, and so he does not see the company "going back to buying off of the shelf."<br/>
<br/>
"I am happier today than I was yesterday than I was last week that we made the transition that we've made and I see the benefit every day of it," said Cook.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Apple's Search Deal With Google</h2><br/>
Cook was asked to comment on its web search partners, with a specific focus on the ongoing antitrust lawsuit that Google is facing from the U.S. Department of Justice.<br/>
<br/>
Cook said that Apple has "important relationships" with its web sear partners, but that he would not get into "commercial relationships" on the call. Cook said that he sees them "as important" and that Apple makes "decisions that we feel are in the best interests of our users."<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[During today's earnings call covering the fourth fiscal quarter of 2023, Apple executives held a Q&amp;A session with analysts and investors. Apple CEO <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tim-cook/">Tim Cook</a> was questioned about how Apple might be able to monetize generative AI, which he of course declined to comment on, but he said that Apple is "investing quite a bit" in AI and that there are going to be product advancements that involve generative AI.<br/>

<blockquote>If you zoom out and look at what we've done with AI and machine learning and how we've used it, these are fundamental technology integral to every product we ship.<br/>
<br/>
When we shipped iOS 17, it included features like Personal Voice and Live Voicemail. AI is at the heart of these features. You can go all the way to the life-saving features on the watch and phone, like Fall Detection, Crash Detection, and ECG on the watch. These would not be possible without AI. We don't label them as such, because we labeled them as to what their consumer benefit is, but the fundamental tech behind it is AI and machine learning.<br/>
<br/>
In terms of generative AI, we obviously have work going on. I'm not going to get into detail about it because we really don't do that, but you can bet we're investing. We're investing quite a bit. We're going to do it responsibly. You will see product advancements over time where those technologies are at the heart of it.</blockquote>Cook said that Apple is planning to be "responsible" when it delves into generative AI technology, and he suggested that features will roll out over time. Current rumors suggest that Apple's is planning <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/22/apple-generative-ai-features-and-smarter-siri/">some major AI updates</a> for 2024, some of which could use generative AI.<br/>
