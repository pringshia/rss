		<description><![CDATA[Apple will launch its annual Back to School promotion for university students in the United States and Canada this week, according to <a href="https://pro.twitter.com/i/decks/1572255292661895168"><em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-851334" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/06/2022-back-to-school-apple-feature.jpg" alt="" width="2178" height="1224" /><br/>
Apple's back to school sales provide students with a free Apple gift card when purchasing a Mac or an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>, and this year's promotion could help Apple push the new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m2/">M2</a> <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/">iPad Air</a> and M4 <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a> models. Last year, Apple offered U.S. students <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/06/06/apple-launches-2023-back-to-school-promotion/">up to &#36;150</a> when purchasing a Mac and up to &#36;100 when purchasing an &zwnj;iPad&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
Apple actually began advertising its Back to School sale on social networks <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/04/apple-back-to-school-2024-sale-soon/">in early June</a>, with some Instagram users seeing an ad promoting Macs with discounts to college and university students.<br/>
<br/>
The ad depicted a Back to School image with the following text: "Buy Mac for university or college with education savings. Plus get a gift card for up to &#36;200." The screenshot of the ad was from a Canadian user, and that price point suggests we will see the same &#36;150 discount in the United States that Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/06/06/apple-launches-2023-back-to-school-promotion/">provided last year</a>.<br/>
<br/>

Clicking on the ad redirected to Apple's education website, but the ad seems to have gone up early as there has been no sign of a Back to School promotion as of yet. Last year's back to school sale began on Monday, June 5. <br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/17/back-to-school-2024-launching-this-week/">Apple&#039;s 2024 Back to School Sale Launching This Week</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apples-2024-back-to-school-sale-launching-this-week.2429448/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple is discontinuing <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-pay/">Apple Pay</a> Later, the buy now, pay later feature that it <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/24/apple-pay-later-launches/">just launched last October</a>. &zwnj;Apple Pay&zwnj; Later is being discontinued as of today, but people who have existing &zwnj;Apple Pay&zwnj; Later loans will be able to continue to pay them off and manage them through the Wallet app.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/Apple-Pay-Later-feature-1.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-918417" /><br/>
Apple announced plans to end the feature in a statement provided to <em><a href="https://9to5mac.com/2024/06/17/apple-pay-later-united-states-ending/">9to5Mac</a></em>, which also notes that customers will be able to access installment loans through their credit and debit cards with changes coming to &zwnj;Apple Pay&zwnj; this fall.<blockquote>Starting later this year, users across the globe will be able to access installment loans offered through credit and debit cards, as well as lenders, when checking out with Apple Pay. With the introduction of this new global installment loan offering, we will no longer offer Apple Pay Later in the U.S. Our focus continues to be on providing our users with access to easy, secure and private payment options with Apple Pay, and this solution will enable us to bring flexible payments to more users, in more places across the globe, in collaboration with Apple Pay enabled banks and lenders.</blockquote>Apple Pay Later officially launched in October and only in the United States, but it had been available in a testing capacity since March 2023. Available in the Wallet app, &zwnj;Apple Pay&zwnj; later allowed customers to split a purchase made with &zwnj;Apple Pay&zwnj; into four equal payments over a six week period, with no interest or fees. &zwnj;Apple Pay&zwnj; Later was available on purchases made on an iOS device using &zwnj;Apple Pay&zwnj;, and was limited to merchandise priced between &#36;75 and &#36;1,000. Each purchase required a separate loan application and approval.<br/>
<br/>
Apple did not provide insight into why it is discontinuing &zwnj;Apple Pay&zwnj; Later, but it is working to unravel its partnership with Goldman Sachs, the company that handles the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-card/">Apple Card</a>, the Apple Savings account, and &zwnj;Apple Pay&zwnj; Later. Nixing &zwnj;Apple Pay&zwnj; Later means that Apple does not need to worry about replacing that functionality with a future partner.<br/>
<br/>
In <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a>, Apple will let users access installment financing options from their bank when using &zwnj;Apple Pay&zwnj;, which will replace the &zwnj;Apple Pay&zwnj; Later feature that Apple is eliminating. &zwnj;Apple Pay&zwnj; will also gain support for viewing rewards or points balances in Wallet and redeeming them with purchases.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-pay-later/">Apple Pay Later</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/17/apple-discontinuing-apple-pay-later/">Apple Discontinuing Apple Pay Later</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-discontinuing-apple-pay-later.2429447/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a> includes many new features for the iPhone, but not all of them will be available when the update is initially released in September.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/Generic-iOS-18-Feature-Real-Mock.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-954594" /><br/>
Below, we have listed all of the features that will not be available until a later version of iOS 18, according to Apple's website. The features should begin rolling out with iOS 18.1 in October and iOS 18.2 in December, with more to follow next year.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Mail Categorization</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/iOS-18-Mail-Categorization.png" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-955888" /><br/>
In an update to iOS 18 coming later this year, the Mail app will gain four new categories powered by on-device intelligence:<br/>
<br/>
<ul><li><strong>Primary:</strong> Personal and time-sensitive emails</li><br/>
<li><strong>Transactions:</strong> Receipts and confirmation emails</li><br/>
<li><strong>Updates:</strong> News and social media notifications</li><br/>
<li><strong>Promotions:</strong> Marketing emails and coupons</li></ul>These categories will be available on devices set to English, and All Mail will remain an option.<br/>
<br/>
The app will also be getting a new digest view that shows emails from a single business, such as various emails from United Airlines ahead of a flight.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Some Apple Intelligence Features</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/iOS-18-Siri-Personal-Context.png" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-955889" /><br/>
A subset of Apple Intelligence features will be available on iPhone 15 Pro models and newer when iOS 18 is publicly released in September, but only with the device language set to U.S. English. The features will have a "preview" label initially.<br/>
<br/>
On its Apple Intelligence page, Apple says "some features, additional languages, and platforms will be coming over the course of the next year," but the company has not shared specific details. In his <em>Power On</em> newsletter last weekend, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-06-16/when-is-apple-intelligence-coming-some-ai-features-won-t-arrive-until-2025-lxhjh86w"><em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman said</a> some Siri features powered by Apple Intelligence are unlikely to launch until 2025, including personal context, on-screen awareness, and deeper per-app controls. He also said Apple Intelligence will not support additional languages or regions until next year.<br/>
<br/>
Gurman does expect Siri's redesign and more natural voice on the initial release of iOS 18, along with Apple Intelligence features that can improve your writing, prioritize notifications, summarize messages, generate custom emoji, and more. <br/>
<br/>
<h2>Control Robot Vacuums With Siri</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/Roomba-and-HomeKit-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-955897" /><br/>
Robot vacuum support in the Home app is coming an update to iOS 18 later this year, allowing you to ask Siri to clean your floors and so forth.<br/>
<br/>
Apple says the Home app will support the "core functionality" of robot vacuum cleaners, such as vacuuming, mopping, power control, cleaning mode, and charge status. Robot vacuums will also work with automations and scenes in the app.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Electricity Usage in Home App <span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 22px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #4e6c99; padding: 3px 6px; border-radius: 4px;">U.S. Only</span></h2><br/>
Another new feature coming to the Home app in an update to iOS 18 later this year is the ability to view your home's electricity usage right in the app. This feature will be available for Pacific Gas and Electric Company customers in the U.S. who have residential electrical service, so long as they are the account owner or an authorized user.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-18/">iPadOS 18</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-18.244">iOS 18</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-18.245">iPadOS 18</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/17/ios-18-features-coming-in-ios-18-1-or-later/">These iOS 18 Features Aren&#039;t Coming to iPhones Until iOS 18.1 or Later</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/these-ios-18-features-arent-coming-to-iphones-until-ios-18-1-or-later.2429446/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

The &zwnj;visionOS&zwnj; beta can be downloaded by going to the Settings app on the device and toggling on developer betas. A registered developer account is required, and Apple recommends making a backup before installing new software.<br/>
<br/>

Registered developers are able to download the tvOS 17.6 update by opting in to the beta through the Settings app on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a>. A registered developer account is required.<br/>
<br/>
tvOS software releases are usually minor in scale compared to other operating system updates, focusing primarily on smaller improvements rather than outward-facing changes. We don't yet know what's included in tvOS 17.6.<br/>
<br/>
Apple shares some information on tvOS releases in its <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207936">tvOS support document</a>, which is updated after each tvOS launch, but Apple does not provide notes during beta testing.<br/>
<br/>
Though we don't always know what's new in tvOS betas, we let <em>MacRumors</em> readers know when new updates are available so those who are developers can download new software upon release.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_TV">Apple TV (Caution)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-tv-and-home-theater.100">Apple TV and Home Theater</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/17/apple-seeds-first-beta-of-tvos-17-6-to-developers/">Apple Seeds First Beta of tvOS 17.6 to Developers</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-seeds-first-beta-of-tvos-17-6-to-developers.2429438/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today seeded the first betas of upcoming iOS 17.6 and iPadOS 17.6 updates to developers for testing purposes, with the software coming a few weeks after the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ios-17-5-features/">launch of iOS 17.5</a> and iPadOS 17.5.<br/>
<br/>

Registered developers are able to opt into the betas by opening up the Settings app, going to the Software Update section, tapping on the "Beta Updates" option, and toggling on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a> or <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-17/">iPadOS 17</a> Developer Beta. An <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-id/">Apple ID</a> associated with a developer account is required to download and install the beta.<br/>
<br/>
The features Apple promised for &zwnj;iOS 17&zwnj; have all been implemented, so it is not clear what will be included in iOS 17.6. It is expected to be one of the final feature updates to &zwnj;iOS 17&zwnj;, as Apple will soon transition most of its focus to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a>. <div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-17/">iPadOS 17</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-17.241">iOS 17</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-17.242">iPadOS 17</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/17/apple-seeds-ios-17-6-beta-1-to-developers/">Apple Seeds First Betas of iOS 17.6 and iPadOS 17.6 to Developers</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-seeds-first-betas-of-ios-17-6-and-ipados-17-6-to-developers.2429435/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a> adds many new features to the Messages app, including the ability to schedule messages to be sent later, the ability to use any emoji or sticker as a Tapback, text formatting options like bold and italics, and much more.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/iOS-18-Messages-Feature-1.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-955693" /><br/>
iOS 18 is currently available in beta for members of the Apple Developer Program, with a public beta to follow in July. The software update should be widely released in September, and it is compatible with the iPhone XS and newer.<br/>
<br/>
Below, we outline everything new in the Messages app on iOS 18, including some smaller changes that Apple's website does not mention.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Schedule Messages</h2><br/>
iMessages can now be scheduled to be sent at a later date and time in both individual and group conversations. As of the first iOS 18 beta, you can schedule a message to be sent up to 14 days later. After scheduling a message, it becomes visible to you in a dotted-line bubble, with edit, delete, and reschedule options.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/iMessage-Send-Later-iOS-18.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-955789" /><br/>
To access this feature, tap the plus sign to the left of the text field, tap More, and tap Send Later.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Tapback Changes</h2><br/>
<h3>Redesigned Tapbacks</h3><br/>
The classic set of Tapback icons are now colorful, including the heart, thumbs up, thumbs down, HA HA, exclamation marks, and question mark.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/iMessage-iOS-18-2.jpeg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-954501" /><br/>
<h3>Emoji Tapbacks</h3><br/>
You can now use any emoji or sticker as a Tapback.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/iMessage-iOS-18-4.jpeg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-954505" /><br/>
<h3>Improved Visibility</h3><br/>
It is now easier to view multiple Tapback reactions on a single message.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Text Formatting and Effects</h2><br/>
Bold, italics, underline, and strikeout formatting is finally available for iMessages. In addition, there are all-new text effects that can animate words within an iMessage, including Big, Small, Shake, Nod, Explode, Ripple, Bloom, and Jitter.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/iMessage-iOS-18-1.jpeg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-954499" /><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/iOS-18-Text-Effects-iMessage.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-955785" /><br/>
<h2>Messages via Satellite <span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 22px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #4e6c99; padding: 3px 6px; border-radius: 4px;">U.S. Only</span></h2><br/>
iOS 18 allows you to send and receive both iMessages and SMS messages via a satellite connection, even if there is no emergency.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/iOS-18-Messages-via-Satellite.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-955787" /><br/>
This feature will work with messages, emoji, and Tapbacks, and all iMessages sent over satellite are secured with end-to-end encryption.<br/>
<br/>
Messages via satellite is available on all iPhone 14 models and newer in the U.S. only at launch.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/13/ios-18-messages-via-satellite-first-look/">Hands-on demo videos</a> show the feature in action.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>RCS Support <span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 22px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #4e6c99; padding: 3px 6px; border-radius: 4px;">Later This Year</span></h2><br/>
Apple's website says that iOS 18 will support RCS (Rich Communication Services) in the Messages app. While this feature is not enabled in the first iOS 18 beta, Apple said it will be rolled out later this year, likely by time iOS 18 is widely released.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/iOS-18-WWDC-Slide.png" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-955808" /><em>WWDC keynote slide confirming RCS support on iOS 18</em></div><br/>
RCS support will result in the following improvements to the default messaging experience between iPhones and Android devices:<ul><br/>
 <li>Higher-resolution photos and videos</li><br/>
 <li>Audio messages</li><br/>
 <li>Typing indicators</li><br/>
 <li>Read receipts</li><br/>
 <li>Wi-Fi messaging</li><br/>
 <li>Improved group chats, including the ability for iPhone users to leave a conversation that includes Android users</li></li><br/>
</ul>SMS continues to be supported as well.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Emoji and Link Card Changes</h2><br/>
When you send a message with only a single emoji, it now appears even larger than before.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/iMessage-iOS-18-Link-Cards.jpg" alt="" width="2358" height="1323" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-955800" /><br/>
Link cards are now more colorful, with the background better matching the linked content.<br/>
<br/>
For some links, you can now choose between full-size and compact link cards, and there is an option to send a link as plain text instead.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Other Changes</h2><br/>
<ul><li>Any app can be <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/10/ios-18-hide-lock-apps/">locked behind Face ID</a>, Touch ID, or an iPhone's passcode on iOS 18, including the Messages app.</li><br/>
<li>iOS 18 can <a href="https://x.com/rjonesy/status/1801636095219929407">solve math equations in the text field</a> of any app, including the Messages app.</li><br/>
<li>iOS 18 adds contact photos next to names in the Messages app <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/13/ios-18-carplay-features/">on CarPlay</a>.</li></ul><div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-18/">iPadOS 18</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/messages/">Messages</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-18.244">iOS 18</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-18.245">iPadOS 18</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/17/everything-new-in-ios-18-messages-app/">Here&#039;s Everything New in the Messages App on iOS 18</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/heres-everything-new-in-the-messages-app-on-ios-18.2429423/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Today we're tracking a pair of deals on Apple's <a href="https://howl.me/cmtYt3Ri3Wl">sixth-generation iPad mini</a> and <a href="https://howl.me/cmtYtvdOtL2">fifth-generation iPad Air</a>, which are available on Best Buy and Amazon. Both of these sales are notable for having nearly every model of each tablet on sale right now, with as much as &#36;200 off select models.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Starting with the 64GB Wi-Fi M1 iPad Air, Best Buy has this model for <a href="https://howl.me/cmtYvqU5f2K"><strong>&#36;399.99</strong></a>, down from &#36;599.99. This is an all-time low price on this model of the 2022 iPad Air, and it's available in every color. You'll also find the 256GB Wi-Fi iPad Air on sale, as well as both cellular devices, one of which is only available on Amazon.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple is not expected to introduce its most significant Apple Intelligence features in September when ‌iOS 18‌ sees a public release. Instead, many will come alongside a Siri overhaul in a future ‌iOS 18‌ update that's set to be introduced in 2025. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/apple-intelligence.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-954498" /><br/>
That doesn't mean Siri will not have any improvements when iOS 18 initially launches. According to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-06-16/when-is-apple-intelligence-coming-some-ai-features-won-t-arrive-until-2025-lxhjh86w"><em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman</a>, Siri in iOS 18 will still have some "new bells and whistles" come September, including a new interface that glows a light around the edge of the screen, richer natural language capabilities that will allow Siri to understand you even if you stumble over your words, a greater knowledge of Apple products to power on-device support, and a Type to Siri option for entering queries via text.<br/>
<br/>
But according to Gurman, we will have to wait until next year to see Apple's most significant enhancements to Siri. An iOS 18 update in 2025 should bring with it the following improvements to Apple's virtual assistant:<br/>
<ul><li><strong>Personal Context: </strong>Siri will have the ability to draw from your photos, calendar events, Messages, and other apps to inform responses to queries. Apple gave an example of a person asking when their mom's flight is landing, which Siri figured out based on recent text conversations and emails.</li><br/>
<li><strong>Semantic indexing:</strong> Apple Intelligence creates an on-device semantic index to store data retrieved from your emails, images, websites you visit, and apps you use.</li><br/>
<li><strong>App Control:</strong> ‌Siri will be able to‌ control all individual features in apps for the first time, expanding the range of functions the personal assistant can perform. ‌Siri‌ will be able to do things like open specific documents, move a note from one folder to another, delete an email, summarize an article, email a web link, and open a particular news site in Apple News. </li><br/>
<li><strong>On-screen awareness:</strong> With onscreen awareness, Siri will be able to understand and take action with users' content in more apps over time. For example, if a friend texts a user their new address in Messages, the receiver can say, "Add this address to his contact card."</li></ul>Like these Siri improvements, Apple Intelligence features will initially only support American English, and support for additional languages and regions won't arrive until 2025. <br/>
<br/>
<h2>AI Updates Coming Later in 2024</h2><br/>
Gurman notes that some of the Mail app's new AI features won't be ready until "later in 2024." These include a redesign that can group emails in categories like newsletters, announcements and shopping. Swift Assist, a new programming companion for Xcode that uses cloud-based AI models, is similarly not expected to arrive until later in the year. Siri integration with ChatGPT may also miss the initial release, though Gurman thinks it should be ready later in 2024, based on language Apple has used in its marketing materials. <br/>
<br/>
Going on past release timelines, these features are likely to arrive in an iOS 18.1 or iOS 18.2 update around October or December.<br/>
<br/>
Despite the missing enhancements, the initial version of Apple Intelligence will still offer a plethora of features, according to Gurman. It will leverage AI to prioritize notifications and provide quick recaps of your alerts and text messages. The software will also have the capability to summarize webpages, voice memos, meeting notes, and emails. Additionally, it will introduce new writing tools, image generation, and custom AI-generated emojis called Genmoji. <div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-18/">iPadOS 18</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/">Apple Intelligence</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-18.244">iOS 18</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-18.245">iPadOS 18</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/17/apple-siri-improvements-coming-2025/">iOS 18: These Apple Intelligence Features Won&#039;t Be Ready Until 2025</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-18-these-apple-intelligence-features-wont-be-ready-until-2025.2429408/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple intends to slim down the MacBook Pro, Apple Watch, and iPhone, with the new ultra-thin M4 iPad Pro a sign of the company's new design trajectory, according to <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/iPod-Nano-vs-iPod-Pro-Ad-Feature-1.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="721" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-949953" /><br/>
When the M4 iPad Pro was unveiled last month, Apple touted it as the company's thinnest product ever, and even compared it to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/08/ipod-nano-appears-in-new-ipad-pro-ad/">2012 iPod nano</a> to emphasize its slim dimensions. <br/>
<br/>
Writing in the latest edition of his <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-06-16/when-is-apple-intelligence-coming-some-ai-features-won-t-arrive-until-2025-lxhjh86w">Power On newsletter</a>, Gurman says that like the iPad Pro, Apple is now focused on delivering the thinnest possible devices across its lineups without compromising on battery life or major new features.<br/>
<br/>
Gurman writes that the new iPad Pro is the "beginning of a new class of Apple devices," and that Apple's aim is to offer "the thinnest and lightest products in their categories across the whole tech industry."<br/>
<br/>
Apple now reportedly has its sights on making thinner versions of iPhone, Apple Watch, and MacBook Pro over the next couple of years.<br/>
<br/>
Gurman's sources tell him Apple is now focused on developing a significantly skinnier iPhone in time for the iPhone 17 line in 2025, corroborating a May report by <em>The Information</em>. According to the latter report, Apple is planning to launch an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/17/slimmer-iphone-17-major-redesign-rumor/">all-new thinner iPhone 17</a> model next year that will allegedly feature a "major redesign" akin to the iPhone X.<br/>
<br/>
Gurman previously <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/13/gurman-apple-watch-x-redesign-planned/">reported</a> that Apple is planning a complete revamp of the Apple Watch for the device's tenth anniversary, dubbed "Apple Watch X." <br/>
<br/>
Since the original Apple Watch was unveiled in 2014 and launched in 2015, Gurman is unsure whether the ‌Apple Watch X‌ will be released in 2024 or 2025. However, Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo today <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/17/kuo-apple-watch-series-10-larger-screen-thinner/">claimed</a> that this year's upcoming Apple Watch will have a larger screen and thinner design, which sounds like the sort of major overhaul and design signature that Gurman has suggested.<br/>
<br/>
In 2021, Apple significantly redesigned the MacBook Pro, making it thicker and heavier. A major highlight of the redesign was the reintroduction of several ports that were removed in previous iterations in favor of chassis thinness. MacBook Pro models now include an HDMI port, an SD card slot, MagSafe 3 charging port, three Thunderbolt 4 (USB-C) ports, and a headphone jack. <div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17/">iPhone 17</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/17/apple-plans-thinner-iphone-slimmer-macbook/">Apple Developing Thinner MacBook Pro, Apple Watch, and iPhone</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-developing-thinner-macbook-pro-apple-watch-and-iphone.2429400/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This year's Apple Watch Series 10 will be thinner and come in larger screen sizes than previous models, according to Apple analyst <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/">Ming-Chi Kuo</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/08/apple-watch-series-9-display.jpeg" alt="" width="1960" height="1102" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-913380" /><br/>
In his latest industry note <a href="https://medium.com/@mingchikuo/2h24-新款apple-watch關注焦點-series-10-鉑力特-3d列印-the-focus-of-the-2h24-new-apple-watch-series-10-and-98075c44ce92">shared on Medium</a>, Kuo said the screen size options on the next-generation Apple Watch will increase from 41mm to 45mm, and from 45mm to 49mm, while being encased in a thinner design. For reference, the Apple Watch Ultra has a 49mm case.<br/>
<br/>
As for Apple Watch Ultra, Kuo said it will remain "roughly the same" this year, although if production yields meet expectations, a new dark/black case color option could be made available.<br/>
<br/>
Apple will also start using 3D printing technology to manufacture Apple Watch components later this year, following extensive testing which has significantly improved the production efficiency. Kuo said BLT will be the supplier of 3D-printed components.<br/>
<br/>
<em>Bloomberg</em> previously <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/13/gurman-apple-watch-x-redesign-planned/">reported</a> that the 2024 Apple Watch could be labeled the "<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-watch-x/">Apple Watch X</a>" to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the Apple Watch, but Kuo made no mention of this possibility in his latest note. <em>Bloomberg</em> also said that Apple is considering a magnetic band attachment system that will allow the design to be made thinner, but it is unclear whether the system will be ready or present on the 2024 Apple Watch.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch/">Apple Watch Series 9</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/">Ming-Chi Kuo</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch">Apple Watch (Caution)</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/17/kuo-apple-watch-series-10-larger-screen-thinner/">Kuo: Apple Watch Series 10 to Get Larger Screen and Thinner Design</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/kuo-apple-watch-series-10-to-get-larger-screen-and-thinner-design.2429393/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/04/iOS-18-Siri-Integrated-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-945741" /><br/>
With Vocal Shortcuts, you can assign a custom phrase that &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; can understand to launch shortcuts and complete "complex tasks," and one of the shortcuts you can set up is an alternative for "Hey &zwnj;Siri&zwnj;."<br/>
<br/>
To set up a Vocal Shortcut for &zwnj;Siri&zwnj;, open up the Settings app, go to Accessibility, and scroll down to Vocal Shortcuts. From there, choose "Set Up Vocal Shortcuts," and select "&zwnj;Siri&zwnj;" (not &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; Request). Type in the new name that you want to use to activate &zwnj;Siri&zwnj;, such as "Computer."<br/>

Once your new name is set, you can say that name to activate &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>. Note that this is limited to the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;, and it does not sync to other devices like <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod/">HomePod</a> so you'll still need to use "&zwnj;Siri&zwnj;" for those devices.<br/>
<br/>

<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/iOSBeta/comments/1dfeobg/ios_18_db1_vocal_shortcuts_can_be_used_to_trigger/">As noted on Reddit</a>, if you set this up, you need to pause to wait for it to activate before you give a command. With &zwnj;Siri&zwnj;, you can say an entire phrase, like "Hey &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; what time is it?" without stopping. That does not work with the Vocal Shortcut setup. You need to state the wake word, pause, and then give the command once the wake word has activated &zwnj;Siri&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
Because of the delay, this isn't likely an option that most people are going to want to use permanently, though &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; will still activate with "Hey &zwnj;Siri&zwnj;" as well as the shortcut.<br/>
<br/>
Vocal Shortcuts can be used to set a voice command to run any shortcut, plus you can set up triggers for apps, system features like taking a screenshot, changing volume, scrolling, activating Control Center, and more. Vocal Shortcuts can be paired with a custom sound instead of speech, and it is a useful accessibility option aimed at those who need alternative ways to activate system features.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-18/">iPadOS 18</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-18.244">iOS 18</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-18.245">iPadOS 18</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/14/ios-18-rename-siri/">You Can Give Siri a New Name With iOS 18&#039;s Vocal Shortcuts</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/you-can-give-siri-a-new-name-with-ios-18s-vocal-shortcuts.2429243/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Popular audio company Sonos recently updated its U.S. privacy policy to make a small but notable change that seemingly puts customer data at risk. As noted by Louis Rossmann (via <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/14/24178433/sonos-privacy-policy-customer-data-controversy">The Verge</a></em>), the new Sonos privacy policy removes a line about not selling customer data.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/04/sonos-roam-feature.jpg" alt="" width="3840" height="2160" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-792626" /><br/>
In the 2023 version of its privacy policy, Sonos had this sentence: "We do not and will not sell your personal data to third parties." The statement has been removed from the 2024 version of the privacy policy in the United States, though it is still present in privacy policies in other countries.<br/>
<br/>
The change to the privacy policy has <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/sonos/comments/1desj5c/sonos_updates_tos_and_removes_clause_explicitly/">sparked commentary on Reddit</a> from Sonos customers who have become increasingly unhappy with the company in recent months. Back in May, Sonos rolled out a new app design that has <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/10/sonos-said-rolling-out-widely-criticized-app-redesign-took-courage/">been widely criticized</a> for missing a long list of features like editing a song queue, managing playlists, shuffling a music library, and more.<br/>
<br/>
Sonos users already unhappy with the app changes feel that the privacy policy update is another nail in the coffin for Sonos. From Reddit user <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/sonos/comments/1desj5c/sonos_updates_tos_and_removes_clause_explicitly/">RemarkableAgent1350</a>:<br/>
<blockquote>What is happening at Sonos? This hurts to read, especially after all the app drama - and from a company that I loved. This just might be the straw that broke the camel's back, so to speak. I think I'm done with Sonos.</blockquote><br/>
The removal of that line from the privacy policy doesn't mean Sonos is definitely selling customer data, and the company has not responded queries about what the change means as of yet.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/sonos/">Sonos</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/14/sonos-privacy-policy-change-suggests-it-might-sell-your-data/">Sonos&#039; Privacy Policy Change Suggests It Might Sell Your Data</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/sonos-privacy-policy-change-suggests-it-might-sell-your-data.2429242/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a> is giving <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> users who find themselves in an emergency situation a way to provide more information and context to emergency responders with an update to Emergency SOS.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/emergency-sos.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-955647" /><br/>
Emergency SOS now supports live video, which means once the SOS feature is activated, streaming video and recorded media can be sent to emergency personnel. Emergency dispatchers can send a request for a user to share either live video or a video from the camera roll, which Apple says should make it easier and faster to get help.<br/>
<br/>
Video is sent over a secure connection to the emergency dispatcher. The option could allow those in emergency situations to send key information for location purposes, to assess injury or risk, or to be used as evidence at a later date.<br/>
<br/>
Emergency SOS is a feature on the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; and Apple Watch that automatically calls the local emergency number and shares location information with emergency services. It is the backbone of the Crash Detection, Fall Detection, and Emergency SOS via satellite features.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-18/">iPadOS 18</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-18.244">iOS 18</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-18.245">iPadOS 18</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/14/ios-18-gains-emergency-sos-live-video-support/">iOS 18 Gains Emergency SOS Live Video Support</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-18-gains-emergency-sos-live-video-support.2429240/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[One of the Apple Intelligence features coming in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a> is Genmoji, which will allow <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> users to use AI to generate all-new emoji characters based on text input. The Genmoji will look similar to emoji, but are custom created, according to an <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2024/10220/">iOS 18 WWDC session focused on Genmoji</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/Genmoji-iOS-18.jpeg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-954516" /><br/>
Emoji are not images, but are instead pictographs that are encoded in the Unicode Standard and rendered by each platform. Emoji are added by the Unicode Consortium, which raised some questions about how Apple's Genmoji solution will work.<br/>
<br/>
As it turns out, Apple has designed an NSAdaptiveImageGlyph API for Genmoji and also other images like stickers and Memoji, and this API makes them behave like emoji. It is powered by a standard image format in a square aspect ratio with support for multiple resolutions, and it is augmented with metadata. This setup means that Genmoji and other content using NSAdaptiveImageGlyph can be used with and formatted alongside regular text, similar to emoji.<br/>
<br/>
Genmoji can be used alone, copied, pasted, and sent as stickers. They can be used inline with text, and they respect line height and text formatting. Anywhere that can support rich text can support Genmoji, according to Apple. <br/>
<br/>
Genmoji are not Unicode and may not be appropriate for some data such as identifiers, phone numbers, email addresses, and will not be supported as widely as emoji. Prior versions of iOS, iPadOS, and macOS, as well as apps that do not support rich text will denote Genmoji with a text description.<br/>
<br/>
Apple Intelligence features like Genmoji are not yet in the &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj; developer beta, but Apple plans to let developers begin testing Apple Intelligence sometime this summer. Genmoji and Apple Intelligence will be available to the public this fall, but they will be limited to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a> models and iPads and Macs with M-series chips.<br/>

		<title>You Can Select a Preferred Home Hub in iOS 18</title>

		<description><![CDATA[The Home app in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a> allows <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/homekit/">HomeKit</a> users who have more than one device that serves as a home hub to select which one should be used as the preferred hub. It is a small but useful change because it prevents &zwnj;HomeKit&zwnj; from choosing a hub that is further away from most &zwnj;HomeKit&zwnj; products or that has a weaker connection. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/11/homekit-showdown-2-thumb.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-826321" /><br/>
In <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a> and earlier, there has been no way to select a home hub, and &zwnj;HomeKit&zwnj; has picked randomly. That can lead to connectivity issues in some situations. For those who do not care about which home hub &zwnj;HomeKit&zwnj; selects, Automatic Selection remains an option.<br/>
<br/>
The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a> and the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod/">HomePod</a> are able to serve as home hubs, but the option to set a preferred hub seems to be limited to the &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj; as of right now, because Apple has not yet provided a &zwnj;HomePod&zwnj; beta to developers. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/preferred-home-hub-ios-18.jpg" alt="" width="672" height="767" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-955650" /><em><div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeKit/comments/1df0nkg/new_preferred_home_hub_in_ios18/">Image from Reddit</a></em></div><br/>
Other features coming in &zwnj;HomeKit&zwnj; include Customize Access for managing how and when people access devices like alarm systems, door locks, and garage door openers, with support for guest schedules. There's also a new Express Mode for unlocking door locks automatically as you approach, and support for robot vacuum cleaners is set to come later this year.<br/>
