		<description><![CDATA[Apple is offering a limited-time promotion for its streaming service, giving new and eligible returning subscribers access to Apple TV+ for just &#36;2.99 per month for three months.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/Apple-TV-Plus-Feature-2-Dark-Teal.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-959287" /><br/>
The deal runs until April 24, 2025, and offers a decent discount from the regular &#36;9.99 monthly subscription price, saving viewers &#36;21 over the promotional period.<br/>
<br/>
The offer comes as Apple TV+ has been boosted in popularity with hit shows like "Severance," which recently surpassed "Ted Lasso" as the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/20/severance-more-popular-than-ted-lasso/">platform's most-watched series</a>. Seth Rogen's "The Studio" has also been receiving positive reviews from critics and viewers.<br/>
<br/>
The streaming service also includes sports content with "Friday Night Baseball" and select Major League Soccer matches from MLS Season Pass.<br/>
<br/>
After the three-month promotional period ends, subscriptions will automatically renew at the standard &#36;9.99 monthly rate unless canceled. The deal excludes Apple device customers who are already eligible for a free three-month trial and subscribers who get Apple TV+ through third-party providers or mobile wireless carriers.<br/>
<br/>
Interested readers can check their eligibility through the <a href="https://tv.apple.com/">Apple TV+ website</a> or via the <a href="https://tv.apple.com/channel/tvs.sbd.4000">Apple TV app</a>.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-tv-plus/">Apple TV Plus</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/09/apple-tv-offers-limited-time-discount/">Apple TV+ Offers Limited-Time Discount, &#36;2.99 Monthly for Three Months</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-tv-offers-limited-time-discount-2-99-monthly-for-three-months.2454988/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<title>Report: Apple Airlifted Premium Devices to US to Beat Tariff Deadline</title>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple urgently requested suppliers to ship as many premium devices as possible to the United States by air freight, especially those priced above &#36;3,000, in response to President Donald Trump's announcement of "reciprocal" tariffs of up to 104% on trading partners (via <em><a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Technology/Tech-Asia/From-Apple-to-Samsung-Trump-s-tariffs-force-supply-chains-to-adapt-fast">Nikkei</a></em>).<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/04/cargo-plane.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-998065" /><br/>
Apple, along with Dell, Microsoft, and Lenovo, reportedly scrambled to mitigate the impact of the tariffs by accelerating shipments before April 9, the day the tariffs came into effect.<br/>
<br/>
"We got a call from clients to make as many consumer electronics as possible and to ship as many of them by air as possible," said an executive at a supplier to Apple, Microsoft, and Google. "But the biggest challenge is that we don't have so many components and materials in stock."<br/>
<br/>
The last-minute rush has created logistical challenges, with suppliers struggling to fulfill orders due to component shortages and tight shipping deadlines. All customs clearances had to be completed before midnight on April 8, U.S. time, creating what one international air shipping manager described as "a race against the clock."<br/>
<br/>
The action comes as Chinese exports on Wednesday faced their biggest U.S. tariff of 104%. This is a combination of 20% levied earlier, 34% announced last week, and 50% imposed by Trump hours earlier following Beijing's refusal to withdraw a retaliatory tariff on U.S. goods.<br/>
<br/>
Apple has been evaluating various strategies to minimize the impact of Trump's tariffs. The company has been diversifying its manufacturing base for years, with India becoming an increasingly important production hub.<br/>
<br/>
A <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/07/apple-iphone-tariffs-india/">recent report</a> suggests Apple plans to source more iPhones for the U.S. market from India, where tariffs are set at 26% compared to the 104% tariff on goods from China. The company expects to produce approximately 25 million iPhones in India this year, potentially meeting around 50% of U.S. iPhone demand in 2025.<br/>
<br/>
The tariff situation has already had a substantial impact on Apple's stock, which has fallen nearly 23% since last Wednesday, as investors worry about the potential effects on the company's profits and global supply chain.<br/>
<br/>
Apple CEO Tim Cook successfully secured exemptions for Apple devices during Trump's first term, but he faces bigger challenges this time around. The company now appears to be pursuing a dual strategy of short-term logistics adjustments while seeking longer-term political solutions.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/nikkei-com/">Nikkei</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/09/apple-airlifted-premium-devices-to-us/">Report: Apple Airlifted Premium Devices to US to Beat Tariff Deadline</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/report-apple-airlifted-premium-devices-to-us-to-beat-tariff-deadline.2454987/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Serial leaker Sonny Dickson is back today with a <a href="https://x.com/sonnydickson/status/1909882112511209611?s=12">new image of some protective cases</a> for Apple's upcoming iPhone 17 Pro, and the large camera hole is certainly the standout feature on show.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/04/iphone-17-pro-cases-sonny-dickson.jpg" alt="sonny" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-998057" /><br/>
The iPhone 17 Pro and 17 Pro Max are expected to debut a major redesign of the rear camera bump, replacing the traditional square module with a horizontal, rectangular bar that stretches across the back of the device. This new layout resembles the runway-style camera panel seen on Google Pixel phones. <br/>
<br/>
Apple's iPhones have maintained the same front-facing design language for several years, and the rear is one of the few remaining areas for meaningful visual evolution. Based on CAD renders and leaked parts, the updated bump retains the triangular triple-lens setup on the left, but now the LiDAR scanner, microphone, and flash are repositioned to the right, creating a more symmetrical design. <br/>
<br/>
It's not clear what Apple's rationale is for the design shift, but it may allow for larger or more thermally efficient components, improved spatial separation of sensors for more accurate depth mapping, or simply more efficient internal packaging as Apple continues to shrink the main logic board. <br/>
<br/>
The bump's uniform color, which is reportedly <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/07/iphone-17-pro-no-two-tone-rear-design/">matched with the rest of the chassis</a>, suggests Apple is aiming for a more unified and visually subdued design language than previously thought. Apple is expected to introduce the iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max alongside the regular iPhone 17 and an all-new ultra-thin iPhone 17 Air around mid-September.

		<description><![CDATA[Meta-owned social network Instagram is developing an app for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>, according to a report from <em><a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/instagrams-mosseri-positions-app-tiktok-turmoil">The Information</a></em>. An Instagram employee with insight into Instagram's recent moves to take advantage of the situation with TikTok shared the tidbit about the company's work on an app for tablets.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/03/Instagram-Feature-2.jpg" alt="" width="2250" height="1266" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-786418" /><br/>
Instagram users have wanted an Instagram app since the social network launched in 2010, but Instagram has only been an iPhone-only app. Instagram hasn't wanted to put the time or effort into &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; app development, and in 2022, Instagram head Adam Mosseri said in 2022 that there were no plans for an &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; app because there is "not a big enough group of people" calling for it to make it a priority. In 2020, Mosseri blamed a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2020/02/17/instagram-ceo-ipad-app/">lack of employees</a>, saying that the company has a limited number of employees and "lots to do," and an &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; app was not the "next best thing to do yet."<br/>
<br/>
While there is no Instagram app for the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj;, the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; is able to run the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> version of Instagram. It's not ideal because the app is not optimized for the larger &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; display.<br/>
<br/>
Not much is known about the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; version of Instagram, and there's no word on when it might launch. It is part of the company's plan to capitalize on the looming TikTok ban, which has also seen Instagram attempting to lure popular TikTok creators to Instagram.<br/>
<br/>
Yesterday, Instagram invited creators to New York City to use a new video app called Edits, which is meant to replace the ByteDance-owned CapCut video editing app that was <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/20/instagram-unveils-edits-app/">removed from App Stores</a> in January. Edits has video editing tools for creators, and it is aimed at those who produce short-form videos on mobile devices. <br/>
<br/>
Instagram has also increased the length of reels from 90 seconds to three minutes to match TikTok's video upload length, and made interface tweaks to make the app more closely resemble TikTok.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/instagram/">Instagram</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/08/instagram-ipad-app/">Instagram is Working on an iPad App</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/instagram-is-working-on-an-ipad-app.2454965/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple is going to unveil <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-19/">iOS 19</a> in just about two months at its June WWDC event, and rumors suggest that it's going to bring a big change to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>'s design. It's been described as the most notable <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/10/ios-19-macos-16-major-design-update/">design overhaul since iOS 7</a>, so it should be an exciting update.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/03/iOS-19-visionOS-UI-Elements.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-994345" /><br/>
We've rounded up everything we've heard so far about the design changes coming to &zwnj;iOS 19&zwnj;.<br/>
<ul><br/>
 	<li><strong>visionOS-like design with translucency</strong> - &zwnj;iOS 19&zwnj; is inspired by visionOS, which has an emphasis on translucency and UI elements that kind of fade into the background to put the focus on content. &zwnj;iOS 19&zwnj; could lean heavily into that translucency, with Apple also opting for a floating look for navigation bars, windows, and other parts of the UI.</li><br/>
 	<li><strong>A glassier look</strong> - Remember the Aqua Mac interface? &zwnj;iOS 19&zwnj; has been described as having glass effects or as being glossy, with menu elements that can "reflect" light based on &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; tilt.</li><br/>
 	<li><strong>Subtle lighting effects</strong> - The "glassy" look involves subtle lighting changes, such as a slight glint for some UI elements when you move the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;. The Flashlight and Camera controls on the Lock Screen reportedly have a glass-like sheen that shimmers with movement, for example.</li><br/>
 	<li><strong>More rounded, expanding buttons</strong> - Along with a soft, floating look, navigation bars and buttons could have more rounded edges that blend better with the content behind them. In the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/photos/">Photos</a> app, for example, photos could be full screen with controls in a slimmed down menu bar at the bottom rather than a full navigation strip. <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/haptic-touch-vs-3d-touch-whats-the-difference/">Haptic Touch</a> menus, Control Center options, and permission prompts apparently have more rounded corners, too.</li><br/>
 	<li><strong>Pill-shaped tab bars</strong> - Many apps like the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/">Apple Music</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a>, &zwnj;Photos&zwnj;, Phone, and more have been described as having pill-shaped tab bars at the bottom for accessing controls. There's also less transitioning. Search, for example, doesn't have its own dedicated interface, and instead expands out from the tab bar.</li><br/>
 	<li><strong>Round app icons, maybe</strong> - Leaker <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/jon-prosser/">Jon Prosser</a> says that Apple is going to make the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;'s icons rounder, though he is unclear if they will be entirely circular or some kind of cross between a circle and the current squircle.</li><br/>
 	<li><strong>Simplified navigation and controls</strong> - Apple wants to make it easier to navigate through apps, System settings, and more, so expect a more streamlined experience.</li><br/>
 	<li><strong>Cross-platform cohesiveness</strong> - These design changes aren't just coming to iOS - iPadOS and macOS will also get the same overhauled look, so it will be less jarring going from a Mac to an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; and vice versa.</li><br/>
</ul><br/>

		<description><![CDATA[U.S. President Donald Trump "absolutely" believes that Apple could manufacture its iPhones and other devices in the United States, Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/pWppUGRRHl4?si=7u9cvnn2KX2aBwb6&amp;t=863">said today during a media briefing</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-956778" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/iPhone-Assembly.jpg" alt="" width="1440" height="810" /><br/>
Leavitt was asked whether Trump thought that <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> manufacturing is the kind of technology that could move to the U.S. "Absolutely, he believes we have the labor, we have the workforce, we have the resources to do it," she replied, also referencing the &#36;500 billion investment in the U.S. that <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/24/apple-announces-500b-us-investment-plan/">Apple announced earlier this year</a>. "And as you know, Apple has invested &#36;500 billion here in the United States, so if Apple didn't think the United States could do it, they probably wouldn't have put up that big chunk of change."<br/>
<br/>
Trump is planning to levy steep tariffs on China, Vietnam, Thailand India, the European Union, and other countries starting on April 9. He has claimed that if companies like Apple do not want to pay the tariffs, they should manufacture their devices in the United States. Despite Trump's suggestion that Apple could shift its incredibly complex supply chain to the U.S., it would be next to impossible. Disregarding the expense of such a maneuver, it's not likely that Apple and its suppliers would be able to find enough people with the necessary skillset in the United States. Cook commented on manufacturing in China <a href="https://youtu.be/_ng8xQ-SNGc">in 2017</a>, and said that Apple's iPhones are assembled there because China has expertise in very advanced manufacturing.<br/>
<blockquote>There's a confusion about China. And let me give you my opinion. The popular conception is that companies come to China because of low labor costs. I'm not sure what part of China they go to, but the truth is China stopped being the low labor cost country many years ago. The reason is because of the skill, the quantity of skill in one location, and the type of skill it is.<br/>
<br/>
Like the products we do require really advanced tooling, and the precision that you have to have in tooling and working with the materials we do are state of the art. And the tooling skill is very deep here. You know, in the U.S. you could have a meeting of tooling engineers, and I'm not sure we could fill the room. In China, you could fill multiple football fields. It's that vocational expertise is very deep.</blockquote><br/>
U.S. secretary of commerce Howard Lutnick made similar comments about &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; manufacturing over the weekend, as <a href="https://www.404media.co/a-us-made-iphone-is-pure-fantasy/"><em>404 Media</em> pointed out today</a> in a piece titled "A 'US-Made &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;' Is Pure Fantasy." Lutnick said that the "army of millions and millions of people screwing in little, little screws to make iPhones, that kind of thing is going to come to America," suggesting that neither he nor Trump understands Apple's operations.<br/>
<br/>
<em>404 Media</em> highlights Apple's 27-page supplier list [<a href="https://www.apple.com/nz/supplier-responsibility/pdf/Apple-Supplier-List.pdf">PDF</a>], which lists the more than 50 countries where Apple gets components from. That doesn't even count rare earth minerals that are sourced from 79 countries, and that can't be mined in the U.S. Apple could not avoid tariffs by "manufacturing" in the United States because there is no feasible way all of the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;'s components could be made in one country. Even if we limit "manufacturing" to device assembly, and the U.S. had the skilled employees required (which it does not), cost of living and wages in the U.S. vs. wages in other countries would make the price of a U.S. &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; astronomically higher.<br/>
<br/>
Apple has not yet commented on the tariffs, but the company has been stockpiling iPhones and is also planning to rely on imports from India, where tariffs are lower, to offset some of costs associated with importing devices from China.<br/>
<br/>
It is true that Apple announced a &#36;500 billion investment in the United States, but Apple will be manufacturing servers for its Private Cloud Compute system, not iPhones. Servers are a low demand product that aren't customer facing.<br/>
<br/>
When Apple manufactured the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-pro/">Mac Pro</a> in Texas during Trump's first term, it was <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2021-02-09/this-is-how-tim-cook-transformed-apple-aapl-after-steve-jobs">largely a failure</a>. Apple struggled to find local suppliers, importing components to Texas caused delays and unexpected expenses, and Apple had a hard time finding workers with the required skill.<br/>

As of yesterday, Trump was planning to levy a 54 percent tariff on China, but today, he increased that by another 50 percent. Starting tomorrow, goods imported from China will be subject to a tariff of 104 percent.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/donald-trump/">Donald Trump</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/08/trump-apple-us-iphone-manufacturing/">Trump Believes Apple Could Manufacture iPhones in the U.S.</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/trump-believes-apple-could-manufacture-iphones-in-the-u-s.2454961/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The second-generation <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a> may now be in mass production ahead of its rumored launch later this year, Chinese website <em>IT Home</em> today <a href="https://www.ithome.com/0/843/470.htm">claims</a>. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/Apple-Vision-Pro-2-Feature-2.jpg" alt="" width="2125" height="1195" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-939912" /><br/>
Reporting on information from an unknown source, the website says that key components of the new Vision Pro, including panels, housings, and circuitry, have moved into mass production ahead of the product's purported release later in 2025. Some Apple suppliers are said to be "rushing" to fulfill orders.<br/>
<br/>
In October, <em>The Information</em>'s Wayne Ma <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/23/apple-may-stop-producing-vision-pro-by-end-of-2024/">reported</a> that Apple had abruptly reduced production of the Vision Pro headset ahead of plans to stop making the current version of the device completely by the end of 2024. This means that the device <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/31/vision-pro-may-be-out-of-production/">may no longer be in production</a> and Apple likely has a sufficient number of Vision Pro units in its inventory to meet demand for the device's remaining lifespan through 2025.  <br/>
<br/>
Although Apple's work on a substantially enhanced Vision Pro model has apparently stalled, there are strong indications that the company will release "an incremental update to the product with limited changes to its physical design," such as a chip upgrade, according to <em>The Information</em>. Corroborating this, Apple analyst <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/">Ming-Chi Kuo</a> and <em>Bloomberg</em>'s <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a> have said that a more iterative second-generation Vision Pro is in active development, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/03/apple-vision-pro-with-m5-chip-rumor/">adding the M5 chip</a> and little else. This updated model is expected to reuse many components from the first-generation Vision Pro to offset the surplus inventory in Apple's supply chain and is likely the model <em>IT Home</em>'s report refers to.<br/>
<br/>
Gurman projected the device could launch <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/11/vision-pro-2-with-m5-may-not-launch-until-2026/">between fall 2025 and spring 2026</a>, which broadly lines up with <em>IT Home</em>'s article today. That being said, <em>IT Home</em> does not have a solid track record for identifying authentic Apple rumors, so the report should be taken with a pinch of salt until we know more.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AppleVisionPro">Vision Pro (Neutral)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-vision-pro.209">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/08/vision-pro-2-now-in-production/">Vision Pro 2 May Now Be in Production Ahead of Launch Later This Year</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/vision-pro-2-may-now-be-in-production-ahead-of-launch-later-this-year.2454950/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple will report its earnings results for the second quarter of its 2025 fiscal year <a href="https://investor.apple.com/investor-relations/default.aspx">on Thursday, May 1</a> at 1:30 p.m. Pacific Time. Apple's CEO Tim Cook and CFO Kevan Parekh will discuss the results on a conference call with analysts a half hour later.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/02/Apple-Launch-Logo.jpg" alt="" width="1516" height="850" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-991259" /><br/>
Keep reading for some key things to know about the quarter, including a recap of new products announced, revenue expectations, and more.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>New Products During Quarter</h2><br/>
The quarter ran from December 29, 2024 through March 29, 2025, according to Apple's fiscal calendar. The following products launched during this period:<ul><li>iPhone 16e</li><br/>
<li>iPad Air models with the M3 chip</li><br/>
<li>iPad models with the A16 chip</li><br/>
<li>MacBook Air models with the M4 chip</li><br/>
<li>Mac Studio models with M4 Max and M3 Ultra chips</li><br/>
<li>Powerbeats Pro 2</li><br/>
<li>Various accessories, including a new Magic Keyboard for iPad Air, Black Unity Sport Loop, USB-C to 3.5mm Audio Cable, and more</li></ul><h2>Revenue Expectations</h2><br/>
Apple has not provided formal revenue guidance since before the COVID-19 pandemic, but the average Wall Street estimate for Apple's second quarter revenue is &#36;94.1 billion, according to data compiled by <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/analysis/"><em>Yahoo Finance</em></a>. This would be around a 3.5% increase over the &#36;90.8 billion revenue the company reported <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/02/apple-2q-2024-earnings/">in the year-ago quarter</a>.<br/>
<br/>
This would be in line with the outlook that Parekh provided on last quarter's earnings call:<blockquote>[…] we expect our March quarter total company revenue to grow low to mid single digits year over year.</blockquote><h2>Conference Call</h2><br/>
Cook and Parekh will hold a conference call on May 1 at 2:00 p.m. Pacific Time to discuss the company's quarterly earnings results. The call should last around one hour, and it will include a Q&A segment with analysts.<br/>
<br/>
A live audio stream of the conference call will be available on <a href="https://www.apple.com/investor/earnings-call/">Apple's Investor Relations page</a>, and a recording will be available later in the day for replay.<br/>
<br/>
Investors will be listening for any commentary that Cook and Parekh may provide about tariffs.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>What's Next: Tariffs</h2><br/>
Apple's current quarter runs from March 30 through June 28, and the company has yet to announce any new products during this period.<br/>
<br/>
U.S. President Donald Trump last week announced that the U.S. will be imposing steep tariffs on products imported from China and many other countries, starting April 9. Apple will be impacted by this decision, as it still assembles the majority of iPhones in China, despite pushing to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/07/apple-iphone-tariffs-india/">expand production in countries like India</a>. China will be subject to a 54% tariff, and Trump has threatened the country with additional tariffs. Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/04/2300-dollar-iphone/">could increase prices</a> due to the tariffs, but the company may <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/07/how-apple-could-navigate-trumps-tariffs/">find creative ways to offset the added costs</a>.<br/>
<br/>
The tariffs could provide a boost to Apple's third quarter revenue, as some customers are reportedly <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/07/apple-customers-tariffs-iphone-purchases/">panic-buying iPhones</a> ahead of potential price increases. However, the fourth quarter could be tougher than usual for Apple.<br/>
<br/>
Apple shares are trading at around &#36;184 as of writing, down from a 52-week high of &#36;260.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/aapl/">AAPL</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/earnings/">Earnings</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/08/apple-q2-2025-earnings-call-date/">What to Expect From Apple&#039;s Earnings Call on May 1 as Tariffs Loom</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/what-to-expect-from-apples-earnings-call-on-may-1-as-tariffs-loom.2454949/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[YouTube channel Front Page Tech on Monday shared <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/07/ios-19-rounder-app-icons-video/">renders of iOS 19's alleged new design</a>. The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YGI8sZqWEl0&t=553s">end of the video</a> also revealed a new feature that is supposedly planned for the iPhone 17 Pro models later this year: dual video recording.<br/>
<br/>

According to Front Page Tech host Jon Prosser, the iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max will allow users to record video with the front and rear cameras simultaneously. This is a capability that is already available through select apps on the App Store, such as Snapchat, but it would now be available through the built-in Camera app. Samsung introduced a built-in dual video recording feature on the Galaxy S21 and newer.<br/>
<br/>
Dual video recording in the Camera app would be useful for content creators on platforms like YouTube and TikTok, allowing them to easily overlay a shot of their face over a world-facing video, so that viewers can watch them speak and react.<br/>
<br/>
Skip to the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YGI8sZqWEl0&t=553s">9:13 mark of Front Page Tech's video</a> to hear about this particular rumor.<br/>
<br/>
Apple should release all of the iPhone 17 models in September. It is unclear why this seemingly basic feature will allegedly require an iPhone 17 Pro model.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17-pro/">iPhone 17 Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/jon-prosser/">Jon Prosser</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/08/iphone-17-pro-dual-video-recording-rumor/">iPhone 17 Pro Models Rumored to Offer Dual Video Recording Feature in Camera App</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-17-pro-models-rumored-to-offer-dual-video-recording-feature-in-camera-app.2454941/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[With recent software updates, Apple has made some major changes to the way its stock Mail app looks and works on iPhone, iPad, and Mac. Keen to roll back these changes and revert to how Apple Mail functioned before the updates? Keep reading to learn how it's done.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/General-macOS-Mail-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2250" height="1266" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-900439" /><br/>
When Apple released iOS 18.1, it added a priority messages feature to the Mail app for devices with Apple Intelligence. Then in iOS 18.2, it brought us new Categories that automatically sort your emails into four distinct sections: Primary, Transactions, Updates, and Promotions. The change also added contact photos and business logos for conversations in your inbox.<br/>
<br/>
With the release of iOS 18.4, iPadOS 18.4, and macOS Sequoia 15.4, Apple has now fully rolled out these changes across iPhone, iPad, and Mac. Fortunately, if you don't like the new Mail interface, Apple has also included ways for users to bring back the old functionality. Let's break it down.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>How to Disable Mail Categories</h2><br/>
The new Categories view, while helpful for some, might not suit your email management style. For example, it has attracted criticism for introducing complexity where many users value simplicity and predictability. One major issue is the disconnect between how Mail now organizes email and how long-time users are accustomed to processing their messages via a chronological inbox view.<br/>
<br/>
Categories don't physically move emails out of the inbox, but they impose a new visual and functional structure that can feel unintuitive and inconsistent, especially when emails appear in multiple places at once.<br/>
<br/>
The relationship between Primary and Priority messages adds further confusion, with overlapping but not identical functionality, and badges that only reflect a subset of new mail. And for users who silo accounts across apps or depend on a feed-like view of their inbox, this layered system can feel like a solution in search of a problem – more disruptive than helpful, and out of sync with how many people actually manage their email.<br/>
<br/>
On iPhone and iPad, you can swipe left across the categories to switch to an "All Mail" view (the same option can be found on Mac to the right of the new category buttons). But if you want to remove the categories completely, follow these steps:<br/>
<ol><br/>
  <li>Open the Mail app on your iPhone or iPad.</li><br/>
  <li>Tap the <strong>More</strong> button (three dots) in the upper right corner of your inbox.</li><br/>
  <li>On iPhone/iPad, select <strong>List View</strong> from the pop-up menu.  </li><br/>
</ol><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/10/remove-apple-mail-categories.jpg" alt="mail" width="4170" height="2760" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-981534" /><br/>
<br/>
The More menu also has an "About Categories" section where you can see how your messages have been categorized over the course of the last week, but there is no option to tell the Mail app if you believe an email has been put into the wrong category.<br/>
<br/>
On Mac, there is a More button (three dots) at the top of the inbox view. Click this, and you will see an option to uncheck <strong>Show Mail Categories</strong>. <br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/12/mac-mail-categories.jpg" alt="mail" width="814" height="336" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-997292" /><br/>
<br/>
You can also find the same option in the Mail menu bar (<strong>View ➝ Show Mail Categories</strong>).<br/>
<br/>
Once you switch to List View, your inbox will return to showing all emails in chronological order, just as it did before. The change takes effect immediately. While categorization is not perfect, it's likely something that Apple will improve over time. You can always switch back to Categories view using the same menu if you want to try it again later. <br/>
<br/>
<h2>How to Get Rid of Contact Photos in Mail</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/ios-18-mail-app.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-957054" /><br/>
Contact photos have been added to the Mail app in an effort to make it easier to identify the senders of all the emails you receive. However, if Apple can't recognize a business, or a contact doesn't have an associated photo, it can end up making your inbox look a bit of a mess. <br/>
 <br/>
Fortunately, you can easily turn off the little pictures completely by following these steps:<br/>
<ol><li>Open the Settings app on your iPhone or iPad.</li><br/>
<li>Swipe to the bottom of the menu and tap <strong>Apps</strong>.</li><br/>
<li>Search for or scroll to <strong>Mail</strong> in the list of apps.</li><br/>
<li>Under "Message List," toggle off the switch next to <strong>Show Contact Photos</strong>.</li></ol><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/12/turn-off-mail-contact-photos-ios.jpg" alt="settings" width="4170" height="2760" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-981884" /><br/>
<br/>
That's all you need to do on iPhone and iPad. To reinstate the contact pictures, simply turn on the same option in Settings. In iOS 18.5, currently in beta, Apple will add a more convenient option to disable contact photos right from the Mail app.<br/>
<br/>
If you want to be rid of Mail contact photos on Mac, simply click <strong>Mail ➝ View</strong> in the menu bar, and uncheck the <strong>Contact Photos</strong> option in the dropdown menu. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/04/mail-turn-off-categories.jpg" alt="mail" width="1346" height="704" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-997946" /><br/>
<br/>
<h2>How to Disable Priority Messages</h2><br/>
Devices that have Apple Intelligence support will show priority emails in the Primary inbox. This idea behind the feature is that it lets you see what's most important first. However, the underlying AI is not fully fleshed out, and there may be times when Mail flags junk mail – or worst case, even phishing scams – as a priority message.<br/>
<br/>
To avoid such scenarios, you can turn off the Priority in the following way:<br/>
<ol><li>On iPhone/iPad, tap the <strong>More</strong> button (three dots) in the upper right corner of your inbox.</li> <br/>
<li>Uncheck <strong>Show Priority</strong>.</li></ol><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/04/show-priority-mail-disable.jpg" alt="mail" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-997949" /><br/>
<br/>
On Mac, simply click <strong>Mail ➝ View</strong> in the menu bar, and uncheck the <strong>Priority Messages</strong> option in the dropdown menu. <br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/04/turn-off-priority-messages-mac-mail.jpg" alt="mail" width="1136" height="694" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-997948" /><br/>
<br/>
Note that this option won't appear on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/does-my-iphone-support-apple-intelligence/">devices without Apple Intelligence support</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Summing Up</h2><br/>
As Apple continues to refine the Mail experience across its platforms, it's clear the company is laying the groundwork for a more intelligent and organized inbox. But with such sweeping changes, user preferences can easily be overlooked. Thankfully, Apple has provided ways to disable or revert many of the new features, offering a degree of customization that hasn't always been guaranteed in past updates. <br/>
<br/>
While the current implementation may not suit everyone – and in some situations can leave users completely confused – there's hope that Apple will listen to feedback and make the system smarter, more flexible, and less intrusive in future updates.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-mail/">Apple Mail</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/get-old-apple-mail-back-ios-mac/">How to Get the Old Apple Mail Back</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/how-to-get-the-old-apple-mail-back.2454937/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<title>WhatsApp Tests Advanced Privacy Feature for Blocking Chat Exports</title>

		<description><![CDATA[WhatsApp is testing a new option that lets you control whether other chat members can export your chats with them or automatically save media you send them, according to <a href="https://wabetainfo.com/whatsapp-beta-for-ios-25-10-10-70-whats-new/">WaBetaInfo</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/03/Whatsapp-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2250" height="1266" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-786421" /><br/>
Referred to as "advanced chat privacy," the new option has a toggle in a recent WhatsApp beta for iOS. By turning it on, you can prevent individual users or people in a group chat from exporting the entire chat history outside of WhatsApp. <br/>
<br/>
Enabling the option in a group chat causes everyone in the chat to be notified that advanced chat privacy has been enabled. WaBetaInfo says that turning on the toggle also turns off Meta AI, which lets users interact with a chat bot as part of the wider conversation.<br/>
<br/>
The advanced chat privacy feature also reportedly stops shared media from automatically saving to people's device camera rolls, even if they have "Save all media" enabled for you. But it's not clear if it also prevents users from manually saving photos and video.<br/>
<br/>
While the option prevents complete chat histories from being exported, users are still able to forward individual messages or screenshot them when the setting is enabled, so it doesn't provide total protection. That said, users can still ratchet up the security level by turning on disappearing messages and choosing a set time before they auto-delete.<br/>
<br/>
As this is a beta feature in testing, it's not clear if or when the new advanced chat privacy feature will roll out to the general public.  <br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile, WhatsApp recently launched a new feature that allows users to <a href="https://blog.whatsapp.com/add-music-to-your-whatsapp-status">include a brief music clip</a> in their Status update, which sounds reminiscent of Myspace. Users can post music clips of up to 15 seconds for photos and up to 60 seconds for videos. Music shared on Status is end-to-end encrypted, so only friends can see the songs – not even WhatsApp itself can view what songs users share.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/whatsapp/">WhatsApp</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/08/whatsapp-tests-blocking-chat-exports/">WhatsApp Tests Advanced Privacy Feature for Blocking Chat Exports</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/whatsapp-tests-advanced-privacy-feature-for-blocking-chat-exports.2454933/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Later this year, Apple will introduce the iPhone 17 series, which includes the iPhone 17 Pro and the iPhone 17 Pro Max, two new high-end flagship devices that will be sold alongside the regular iPhone 17 and an all-new ultra-thin iPhone 17 Air.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/04/iPhone-17-Pro-3_4ths-Perspective-Aluminum-Camera-Module-1.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-997826" /><br/>
If you have been holding out for the iPhone 17 Pro or its bigger sibling, here are five of the biggest changes, informed by the latest reports and rumors, that are said to be coming to Apple's premium devices. The iPhone 17 series is expected to be released in the fall around mid-September. For all the details, see our <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17-pro/">dedicated roundup</a>.<br><br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 20px; color: #4A90E2; margin-top: 2px;">1. Redesigned Camera Bump</span><br><br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 14px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #4A90E2; padding: 3px 6px; border-radius: 4px; margin-bottom: 2px;">Google Pixel-Style</span><br><br/>
The iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max are expected to feature a significant redesign of the rear camera bump, shifting to a horizontal, rectangular bar that spans the width of the device. Visually, it's reminiscent of the Google Pixel's runway-style camera panel, and is a notable departure from Apple's long-standing square camera island. According to CAD renders and part leaks, this new bump integrates the familiar triangular triple-lens array on the left, with the LiDAR scanner, microphone, and flash relocated to the right for a more symmetrical layout.<br/>
<br/>
While Apple's rationale for the shift remains unclear, the wider camera bar could offer several practical advantages. It may allow for larger or more thermally efficient components, improved spatial separation of sensors for more accurate depth mapping, or simply more efficient internal packaging as Apple continues to shrink the main logic board. The bump's uniform color, which is reportedly <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/07/iphone-17-pro-no-two-tone-rear-design/">matched to the rest of the chassis</a>, suggests Apple is aiming for a more unified and visually subdued design language than previously thought.<br/>
<br><br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 20px; color: #4A90E2; margin-top: 2px;">2. Upgraded Telephoto Lens</span><br><br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 14px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #4A90E2; padding: 3px 6px; border-radius: 4px; margin-bottom: 2px;">48-Megapixels</span><br><br/>
The iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max will feature a new upgraded Telephoto or "Tetraprism" lens with a 48MP sensor, up from the current 12MP sensor found in the iPhone 16 Pro and Pro Max. This is a long-running rumor that has been corroborated by <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/25/iphone-17-pro-max-48mp-telephoto/">multiple sources</a>. Given that the iPhone 16 Pro models already have 48MP Fusion and Ultra Wide cameras, the iPhone 17 Pro are expected to be the first iPhone models to boast a rear triple-camera array made up entirely of 48-megapixel lenses. <br/>
<br/>
In addition, Apple reportedly plans to emphasize the iPhone 17 Pro's improved video recording capabilities when it unveils the device later this year. What those capabilities will mean in real terms is unclear, but there have been <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/06/iphone-16-pro-4k-at-120fps-video-rumor/">suggestions</a> that all three cameras could support 8K video recording for the first time. Shooting 8K would allow videographers to record using the Ultra Wide camera and then crop in 50% and still achieve 4K resolution.<br/>
<br><br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 20px; color: #4A90E2; margin-top: 2px;">3. Upgraded Selfie Camera</span><br><br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 14px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #4A90E2; padding: 3px 6px; border-radius: 4px; margin-bottom: 2px;">24-Megapixels</span><br><br/>
The iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max are <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/02/iphone-17-24mp-front-camera-rumor/">rumored</a> to feature a major upgrade to the front-facing camera: a 24MP sensor paired with a six-element plastic lens system. This would be a big leap over the iPhone 16 Pro's  12MP front-facing camera that's been used in iPhones for the last several years, and could redefine the selfie and video call experience.<br/>
<br/>
A 24MP sensor allows for much higher detail capture, which isn't just about pixel count – it enables greater flexibility in framing and post-processing. Users will be able to crop, zoom, or recompose their shots without sacrificing sharpness, making it especially appealing for creators who rely on front-facing footage for content production. <br/>
<br><br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 20px; color: #4A90E2; margin-top: 2px;">4. Part-Glass, Part-Aluminum Frame</span><br><br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 14px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #4A90E2; padding: 3px 6px; border-radius: 4px; margin-bottom: 2px;">No More Titanium</span><br><br/>
Apple has gradually shifted the materials used in its premium iPhones – from aluminum to stainless steel, and more recently, titanium. But with the upcoming iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max, the company is expected to return to aluminum for the frame. This move is reportedly driven by environmental goals, as aluminum has a lower carbon footprint compared to titanium, making it a more sustainable choice.<br/>
<br/>
The design of the rear panel is also getting a notable update. The back of the iPhone 17 Pro models will <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/20/iphone-17-pro-dummies-highlight-apples-new-design/">combine aluminum and glass</a>: the top half will be made of aluminum and house a rectangular camera bump (now made from aluminum instead of the usual 3D glass) while the bottom half will remain glass to preserve wireless charging functionality. This hybrid approach suggests Apple is balancing material efficiency with practical features.<br/>
<br><br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 20px; color: #4A90E2; margin-top: 2px;">5. New A19 Pro Processor</span><br><br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 14px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #4A90E2; padding: 3px 6px; border-radius: 4px; margin-bottom: 2px;">Better Performance</span><br><br/>
The iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max are expected to debut with Apple's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/18/a19-and-a19-pro-n3p-rumor/">new A19 Pro chip</a>, built using TSMC's latest third-generation 3nm process, known as "N3P." This next-gen node represents a process shrink, allowing for greater transistor density. In practical terms, that translates to modest gains in both performance and power efficiency over the A18 chip found in the iPhone 16 series.<br/>
<br/>
To complement the upgraded silicon, Apple is also rumored to be introducing <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/12/iphone-17-pro-advanced-cooling-better-performance/">vapor chamber cooling</a> in the iPhone 17 Pro models. This advanced thermal solution helps dissipate heat more effectively, allowing the A19 Pro to sustain peak performance for longer without throttling—especially during demanding tasks like gaming or video editing.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17-pro/">iPhone 17 Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/08/5-biggest-changes-iphone-17-pro/">5 Biggest Changes Rumored for iPhone 17 Pro</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/5-biggest-changes-rumored-for-iphone-17-pro.2454929/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[<a href="https://www.caldigit.com/">CalDigit</a> today announced the upcoming launch of two new Thunderbolt 5 docks, the TS5 and the TS5 Plus. Both docks support transfer speeds of up to 80Gb/s with a speed boost feature when paired with Apple's Thunderbolt 5 Macs.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/04/caldigit-tb5-docks.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-997886" /><br/>
The TS5 has a total of 15 ports, including four Thunderbolt 5 ports, two USB-A ports, three USB-C ports (including two at the front), a headphone jack, an SD card slot, a microSD card slot, and a 2.5Gb Ethernet port. One of the front charging ports supports 20W charging.<br/>
<br/>
The TS5 Plus has 20 ports, including three Thunderbolt 5 ports, five USB-C ports (two at the front), 5 USB-A ports, a headphone jack, an SD card slot, a microSD card slot, and a 10Gb Ethernet port. One of the front ports supports 36W charging, as do two of the rear Thunderbolt 5 ports, so it is able to charge more devices. There is a Dual USB 10Gb/s controller design for better USB performance.<br/>
<br/>
Both docks offer 140W power delivery, which is enough to charge Apple's 16-inch <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro/">MacBook Pro</a> at full speed. On the Mac, the displays support two 4K 240Hz displays or dual 8K 60Hz displays.

		<description><![CDATA[YouTube channel Front Page Tech is back today with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YGI8sZqWEl0">another video</a> that provides a closer look at iOS 19's alleged design changes.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/04/Alleged-iOS-19-Icons-Front-Page-Tech.jpg" alt="" width="3018" height="1508" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-997899" /><br/>
The video contains re-created renders of iOS 19, which are allegedly based on real footage of the software update, provided by sources within Apple. Overall, iOS 19 is expected to have a more <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/16/ios-19-big-design-changes/">glass-like, visionOS-inspired design</a>, with added translucency for user interface elements like buttons, menus, notifications, and more.<br/>
<br/>
The most notable new detail in today's video is that Front Page Tech host Jon Prosser now believes that iOS 19 will feature rounder app icons, although he is not sure if they will be entirely circular like they are on visionOS.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YGI8sZqWEl0?si=GAqyaDO8rcppklUT" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><br/>
Prosser said the rounder app icons are hidden by default on internal iOS 19 builds. Apparently, long pressing on a squircle app icon results in it switching to the rounder design, following a brief animation. It is possible that Apple is attempting to hide this obvious design change from onlookers until iOS 19 is announced <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/25/apple-wwdc-2025/">at WWDC in June</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Another alleged change is the addition of a pill-shaped tab bar at the bottom of many built-in apps, including the App Store, Apple Music, Apple TV, Messages, and Phone apps, among others. On the search tab, there is an elongated search bar, with a circular button to the left of it that you can tap on to return to the expanded tab bar. The video shows off a new animation when you switch between tabs in the bar.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/04/Alleged-iOS-19-Tab-Bar-Front-Page-Tech.jpg" alt="" width="3010" height="1506" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-997907" /><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/04/Alleged-iOS-19-Search-Bar-Front-Page-Tech.jpg" alt="" width="3016" height="1506" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-997908" /><br/>
In the Messages app, the search bar appears to be persistent.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/04/Alleged-iOS-19-Messages-Search-Front-Page-Tech.jpg" alt="" width="3014" height="1506" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-997910" /><br/>
The renders also reveal that Apple has adopted more rounded corners for some elements, including the Haptic Touch menus that appear when you long press on an app icon, as well as the volume and display brightness sliders in Control Center. Permission prompts for camera and microphone access also have an updated appearance.<br/>
<br/>
Prosser previously shared re-created mockups of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/17/ios-19-redesigned-camera-app-visionos-rumor/">iOS 19's alleged Camera app</a>.<br/>
<br/>
The alleged design changes extend to the Settings app, which appears to have slimmer toggles, and to the default keyboard.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/04/Alleged-iOS-19-Menu-Front-Page-Tech.jpg" alt="" width="3012" height="1508" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-997911" /><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/04/Alleged-iOS-19-Toggle-Front-Page-Tech.jpg" alt="" width="3014" height="1506" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-997912" /><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/04/Alleged-iOS-19-Keyboard-Front-Page-Tech.jpg" alt="" width="3018" height="1504" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-997913" /><br/>
Last, Prosser said iOS 19 adds a subtle lighting effect to some elements, which contributes to the rumored glass-like appearance. For example, he said the default Flashlight and Camera controls at the bottom of the Lock Screen shimmer as you move the iPhone.<br/>
<br/>
The first iOS 19 beta should be available immediately following the WWDC keynote on June 9, and the update should be released in September.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-19/">iOS 19</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/jon-prosser/">Jon Prosser</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/07/ios-19-rounder-app-icons-video/">iOS 19 Leak Reveals Alleged New Design With Rounder App Icons, Floating Tab Bar, and More</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-19-leak-reveals-alleged-new-design-with-rounder-app-icons-floating-tab-bar-and-more.2454909/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today stopped signing iOS 18.3.2, a week after <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/31/apple-releases-ios-18-4/">releasing the iOS 18.4 update</a>. Now that iOS 18.3.2 is not being signed, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> users who have upgraded to iOS 18.4 are not able to downgrade to a version of iOS 18.3.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/03/iOS-18.3.2-Apple-Intelligence-Color-Palette-Feature-1.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-994050" /><br/>
It is typical for Apple to stop signing an older version of iOS after releasing an update, and the process keeps &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; users from installing outdated versions of iOS. "Signing" refers to a server-side verification check that's done when versions of iOS are downloaded onto an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;. Only software that passes the verification check is able to be installed.<br/>
<br/>
Preventing downgrading ensures that customers have the latest security improvements and are not vulnerable to known attacks or security holes.<br/>
<br/>
The iOS 18.4 update <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/31/ios-18-4-security-fixes/">fixed more than 60 vulnerabilities</a>, so it is a good idea to install the software if you have not done so already.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/07/apple-stops-signing-ios-18-3-2/">Apple Stops Signing iOS 18.3.2</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-stops-signing-ios-18-3-2.2454907/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Ahead of when new reciprocal tariffs go into effect on April 9, Apple customers are scrambling to buy devices before prices go up. Multiple Apple employees that spoke to <em><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-07/apple-customers-dash-to-stores-to-buy-iphones-ahead-of-tariffs">Bloomberg</a></em> said their stores have been packed with customers "panic-buying" iPhones. "Almost every customer asked me if prices were going to go up soon," one Apple worker was quoted as saying.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/03/Apple-iPhone-16-family-lineup.jpg" alt="" width="3840" height="2160" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-996656" /><br/>
The rush at retail stores was comparable to the busyness of a holiday season, with Apple providing no guidance on what employees should tell customers. Apple's retail stores reportedly experienced higher sales on April 5 and 6 than they have in prior years during the same time period.<br/>
<br/>
Apple has been preparing for the tariffs and has stockpiled iPhones and other devices in the United States. According to <em><a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/mobiles-tabs/how-apple-flew-5-flights-full-of-iphones-from-india-and-china-in-3-days-to-beat-trump-tariffs/articleshow/120044321.cms">The Times of India</a></em>, Apple shipped five planes full of iPhones and other devices from India to the U.S. during the final week of March, while also bringing in iPhones from China during what is traditionally a slow time. The reserves, which could last for several months, will allow Apple to avoid price increases in the near term.<br/>
<br/>
Earlier today, <em>The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/wsj-com/">Wall Street Journal</a></em> said that Apple would mitigate some of the tariff impact by importing <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/07/apple-iphone-tariffs-india/">more iPhones to the U.S. from India</a>, as India has a lower tariff rate than China. Apple could meet as much as 50 percent of U.S. <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> demand with devices sourced from India. Apple has to pay a 26 percent tariff on goods from India, but China's rate is at 54 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Apple stock has fallen almost 20 percent since last Wednesday, but Apple has not commented publicly on the tariff situation. The company has an earnings call planned for May 1, which is when we could hear more about Apple's mitigation plan.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/07/apple-customers-tariffs-iphone-purchases/">Apple Customers Rush to Buy iPhones Amid Fears Tariffs Could Cause Price Hikes</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-customers-rush-to-buy-iphones-amid-fears-tariffs-could-cause-price-hikes.2454906/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[To lessen the impact from the tariffs that U.S. President Donald Trump is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/02/apple-stock-trump-tariffs/">putting in place this month</a>, Apple will import more iPhones to the U.S. from India, reports <em><a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/apple-iphone-production-china-tariffs-6cc37f40">The Wall Street Journal</a></em>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/08/apple-india.jpg" alt="" width="2304" height="1296" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-756076" /><br/>
The 26 percent tariff on goods imported from India will be less of a hit to Apple's bottom line than the 54 percent tariff on goods from China, the 46 percent tariff in Vietnam, or the 36 percent tariff in Thailand.<br/>
<br/>
Apple does not plan to make major changes to its supply chain because the tariff situation is "too uncertain." Sourcing more U.S. iPhones from India will offset the cost of the tariffs in China, and Apple is viewing that as a short term solution while it attempts to persuade Trump into giving its devices an exemption. Apple CEO <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tim-cook/">Tim Cook</a> was successful getting Apple devices exempted from tariffs during Trump's first term, but he has had less luck so far this time around.<br/>
<br/>
Apple has been working to ramp up manufacturing in India for the last several years, and it will make 25 million iPhones in India this year. By redirecting iPhones made in India to the U.S. market, Apple can meet approximately 50 percent of U.S. <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> demand in 2025.<br/>
<br/>
While Trump has set tariffs on Chinese goods at 54 percent, he said today that he would increase them if China does not remove the 34 percent reciprocal tariff that it announced on Friday.<br/>
<br/>
Over the weekend, a report from <em>The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/wsj-com/">Wall Street Journal</a></em> suggested that the current tariff on goods from China could <a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/personal-tech/iphone-apple-tariffs-china-bb20c7a3">increase Apple's component cost</a> for the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; significantly. An <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/">iPhone 16 Pro</a> that costs Apple &#36;580 now, for example, could cost &#36;850 with tariffs. <br/>
<br/>
Trump is pushing for companies like Apple to make their devices in the United States, but that is not feasible because it is more affordable for Apple to pay the tariffs than to attempt to move manufacturing to a country that does not have the number of skilled workers available for the kind of advanced fabrication that Apple requires.<br/>
<br/>
Apple earlier this year announced plans to spend &#36;500 billion on U.S. manufacturing, with the company aiming to create <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/">Apple Intelligence</a> servers and other similar products that have lower demand.<br/>
<br/>
Apple could <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/07/how-apple-could-navigate-trumps-tariffs/">employ other strategies</a> to deal with the tariffs, including pressuring suppliers for lower prices and absorbing some of the cost, but it is quite possible that Apple will raise its prices in the near future.<br/>
<br/>
Trump's tariff plans have caused stocks to drop significantly over the course of the last three days, with Apple stock <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/07/apple-stock-wild-morning/">down nearly 20 percent</a> since last Wednesday.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/07/apple-iphone-tariffs-india/">Apple to Lessen Tariff Impact by Shipping More iPhones From India</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-to-lessen-tariff-impact-by-shipping-more-iphones-from-india.2454901/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>
