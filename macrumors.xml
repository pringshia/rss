		<description><![CDATA[The developers behind popular photography app Halide <a href="https://www.shotwithkino.com/">today announced the launch of Kino</a>, an app designed for capturing cinematic video. Kino has the tools that professionals need while also providing guidance to amateur videographers.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/kino-camera-app.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-952794" /><br/>
Kino offers a one-tap video recording feature with support for a range of color presets. The Instant Grade feature allows users to choose presets created by experts or import their own LUTs. By applying color grading while recording, Kino saves time by removing the need for editing.<br/>
<br/>
An AutoMotion feature helps users capture cinematic movement in a shot by using a 180-degree shutter angle by default. When enough ambient light is available, the Auto label will turn green to indicate that it is an ideal time to capture motion.<br/>
<br/>
While the Kino interface is designed to be simple to use, there are a number of pro tools that can be selected. There are options for adjusting exposure with RV adjustment and AE, and WB lock, or there is a full manual mode for control over shutter speed and ISO.<br/>
<br/>
The app includes quick access tools for adjusting resolution, framerate, encoding, and more, plus there is a level grid, RBG waveform for adjusting exposure, and focus peaking for changing focus. Kino is able to store video recordings in the Files app instead of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/photos/">Photos</a> app for easier video management.<br/>
<br/>
For those new to video recording, there are a series of lessons that can be used to learn all of the available features that are in Kino.<br/>
<br/>
Kino can be downloaded from the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a> for &#36;9.99, a discount of 50 percent off of the standard price. <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a> is required.

		<description><![CDATA[iOS 18 is just around the corner, with Apple set to unveil the software update during its WWDC keynote next month. Below, we recap new features and changes rumored for iOS 18, which is projected to be the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/28/ios-18-big-expectations/">"biggest" update in the iPhone's history</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/iOS-18-WWDC-24-Feature-2.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-944197" /><br/>
iOS 18 is rumored to include new AI features for Siri and many apps, and Apple plans to add RCS support to the Messages app for an improved texting experience between iPhones and Android devices. The update is also expected to introduce a more customizable Home Screen and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/25/ios-18-design-changes-rumors/">other user interface design changes</a>, new features in apps like Apple Maps and Calculator, additional accessibility features, and much more.<br/>
<br/>
WWDC 2024 will begin with Apple's keynote <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/28/wwdc-2024-full-schedule/">on June 10 at 10 a.m. Pacific Time</a>, and the iOS 18 beta should be made available to members of the Apple Developer Program immediately following the presentation. A public beta is typically released in July, and the update should be widely released to all users in September.<br/>
<br/>
For additional information, read our <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18 roundup</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Smarter Siri and Generative AI</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/iOS-18-Mock-Siri-Feature-Baubles.jpg" alt="" width="2250" height="1266" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-909208" /><br/>
iOS 18 is rumored to have <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/16/ios-18-slew-of-new-ai-features/">new AI features</a> for Siri, Spotlight, Shortcuts, Apple Music, Messages, Health, Numbers, Pages, Keynote, and more, according to sources such as <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman and <em>The Information</em>'s Wayne Ma.<br/>
<br/>
Apple CEO Tim Cook has repeatedly teased that the company is working on generative AI, and plans to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/01/apple-ai-details-coming-later-this-year/">share details "later this year,"</a> and Apple's marketing chief Greg Joswiak also <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/26/apple-ios-18-ai-wwdc-2024/">hinted at AI</a> in a social media post about WWDC 2024.<br/>
<br/>
Generative AI surged in popularity in late 2022, when OpenAI released ChatGPT, a chatbot that can respond to questions and other text prompts. The company has also expanded into generative AI tools for images and videos. Other companies like Google and Microsoft have also pushed into the generative AI space, and the technology is quickly evolving.<br/>
<br/>
iOS 18 is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/26/ios-18-reportedly-wont-have-apple-chatbot/">not expected to include an Apple-designed chatbot</a>, but a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/13/apple-finalizing-deal-openai-chatgpt-ios-18/">partnership with OpenAI</a> will reportedly be announced at WWDC.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>More Customizable Home Screen</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/iPhone-Home-Screen-Gradient-Blank-Spaces-1.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-943087" /><br/>
iOS 18 will feature a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/24/ios-18-more-customizable-home-screen-rumor/">"more customizable" Home Screen</a>, according to Gurman.<br/>
<br/>
<em>MacRumors</em> exclusively reported that iOS 18 will finally allow users to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/24/ios-18-home-screen-app-icon-customization/">place app icons anywhere on the Home Screen grid</a>. This means that users will be able to create blank spaces, columns, and rows between app icons. This basic feature has long been available on Android smartphones, and now Apple is bringing it to the iPhone.<br/>
<br/>
iPhone users can already customize the Home Screen with apps such as Shortcuts and Widgetsmith, which can be used to create "blank" app icons and widgets, but Apple's official solution will be much more convenient.<br/>
<br/>
It was also reported that iOS 18 will allow users to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/26/ios-18-to-allow-users-to-recolor-app-icons/">change the color of app icons</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>New Accessibility Features</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/iOS-18-Hover-Typing-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-950842" /><br/>
Earlier this month, Apple previewed many new accessibility features coming later this year with software updates like iOS 18, iPadOS 18, macOS 15, and visionOS 2. The announcement came one day ahead of Global Accessibility Awareness Day.<br/>
<br/>
Some of the new features coming to the iPhone <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/15/ios-18-accessibility-features/">include Eye Tracking</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/15/apple-reduce-motion-sickness-feature/">Vehicle Motion Cues</a>, Music Haptics, and Vocal Shortcuts. <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/15/ios-18-accessibility-features-for-carplay/">CarPlay will also be getting more accessibility features</a> with iOS 18, including Sound Recognition, which will allow drivers or passengers who are deaf or hard of hearing to turn on alerts to be notified of car horns and sirens.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>New Apple Maps Features</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/03/apple-maps-3d-feature.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="896" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-841030" /><br/>
<em>MacRumors</em> previously revealed two potential new Apple Maps features coming with iOS 18: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/26/apple-maps-custom-routes-ios-18/">custom routes</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/27/ios-18-topographic-maps/">topographic maps</a>.<br/>
<br/>
With the custom routes feature, Apple Maps users would be able to choose specific roads to travel on while navigating, for reasons such as familiarity or scenic views. This feature is expected to be available in the U.S. only at launch. Google Maps already allows users to create custom routes on the web, and then view them on an iPhone.<br/>
<br/>
Topographic maps first debuted on the Apple Watch last year with watchOS 10, and code suggests that the feature will be expanded to the iPhone, Mac, and Vision Pro with iOS 18, macOS 15, and visionOS 2. These maps include details such as trails, contour lines, elevation, and points of interest for hiking and other outdoor uses.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>RCS Support in Messages App</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/07/General-Apps-Messages.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1407" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-808613" /><br/>
In November, Apple announced that it would <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/16/apple-to-adopt-rcs-messaging-standard/">support the cross-platform messaging standard RCS</a> in the Messages app on the iPhone starting "later" in 2024, so it will likely be an iOS 18 feature based on that timeframe.<br/>
<br/>
RCS support should result in the following improvements to the default messaging experience between iPhones and Android devices:<ul><br/>
 <li>Higher-resolution photos and videos</li><br/>
 <li>Audio messages</li><br/>
 <li>Typing indicators</li><br/>
 <li>Read receipts</li><br/>
 <li>Wi-Fi messaging</li><br/>
 <li>Improved group chats, including the ability for iPhone users to leave a conversation that includes Android users</li></li><br/>
</ul>These features are already available for iMessage and in many third-party messaging apps, such as WhatsApp and Telegram. RCS support on the iPhone will extend the features to green bubbles in the Messages app.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>More Rumors Per App</h2><br/>
<ul><li><strong>Apple Music:</strong> With iOS 18, Apple Music will reportedly be able to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/22/apple-generative-ai-features-and-smarter-siri/">auto-generate playlists</a>, and there is also a rumor about <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/21/ios-18-apple-music-song-transitions/">smarter song transitions</a>.</li><br/>

This feature would allow users to select specific sections ("scenes") on the canvas for easier navigation.</li><br/>

<li><strong>Mail, Photos, and Fitness:</strong> These apps will reportedly be <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/28/ios-18-notes-mail-photos-fitness-rumors/">"overhauled" with iOS 18</a>. <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/26/10-ai-features-coming-in-ios-18/">AI-powered photo retouching</a> is reportedly coming to the Photos app with iOS 18, and the Mail app could gain <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/26/10-ai-features-coming-in-ios-18/">suggested replies to emails</a>, but no other specific details are known yet for these apps.</li><br/>
<li><strong>Messages:</strong> In addition to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/16/apple-to-adopt-rcs-messaging-standard/">RCS support</a>, it has been rumored that the Messages app will <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/22/apple-generative-ai-features-and-smarter-siri/">use generative AI to auto-complete sentences</a> more effectively, and to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/26/10-ai-features-coming-in-ios-18/">auto-generate custom emojis</a> for users based on the content of messages.</li><br/>

The app is also rumored to gain a built-in audio recording tool, eliminating the need to switch over to the Voice Memos app. In addition, both Notes and Voice Memos could gain the ability to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/10/ios-18-audio-transcriptions-rumor/">transcribe audio</a>.</li><br/>
<li><strong>Safari:</strong> iOS 18 is likely to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/10/ios-18-safari-browsing-assistant-rumor/">add a browsing assistant to Safari</a>, which could <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/30/safari-ai-features-coming-in-ios-18/">summarize web pages and more</a>.

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's TV app could be available on Android smartphones and tablets in the future, according to a <a href="https://jobs.apple.com/en-us/details/200551832/android-software-engineer-apple-tv-app">job listing</a> spotted by <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-05-29/apple-signals-that-it-s-working-on-tv-app-for-android-phones"><em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/Apple-TV-Plus-Black-Banner.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="675" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-952746" /><br/>
Apple is seeking a senior Android software engineer to join the Apple TV app team. The engineer would be tasked with leading the development of "an application used by millions to watch and discover tv and sports," which heavily suggests that Apple plans to make its TV app available on Android smartphones and tablets.<br/>
<br/>
With the Apple TV app, Android smartphone and tablet users would have a more convenient way to access the Apple TV+ streaming service, instead of having to rely on tv.apple.com on the web. The app also provides access to MLS Season Pass, includes a storefront for purchasing or renting movies and TV shows, and more.<br/>
<br/>
Apple already offers the TV app on Android TV devices, including the Chromecast with Google TV, but not on the main Android platform. Apple only offers a <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Apple&hl=en_US">handful of apps</a> on Android phones, such as Apple Music, Move to iOS, and a Beats app.<br/>
<br/>
Android would join a long list of platforms where Apple's TV app is available, including the iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple TV, Apple Vision Pro, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series S, Xbox Series X, Roku and Amazon Fire TV streaming sticks, select smart TVs, and more. It is unclear when the app will be made available to the public, or if development has started.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/android/">Android</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-tv-plus/">Apple TV Plus</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/29/apple-tv-app-for-android-job-listing/">Apple TV App Likely Coming to Android Smartphones, Job Listing Shows</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-tv-app-likely-coming-to-android-smartphones-job-listing-shows.2427695/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's M2 iPad Air models are less than a month old, and <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0D3J5VFYQ%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1">Amazon has up to &#36;80 off select models</a> this week. We're tracking deals across the entire Wi-Fi M2 iPad Air lineup, although the steepest discounts will be found on 13-inch models.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today shared a new ad called "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoimKc1CGh4">Worlds Made on iPad</a>" on its YouTube channel. The video features green-screen footage from actress Sofia Wylie overlaid on three different animated backdrops, which Apple says were created by illustrators using the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/07/apple-announces-new-ipad-pro/">new iPad Pro with the M4 chip</a> and the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/07/apple-pencil-pro-announced/">Apple Pencil Pro</a>.<br/>

"One piece of green screen footage interpreted by different animators using iPad Pro powered by the M4 chip, and the new Apple Pencil Pro," says Apple's video description. The ad is set to the song "Concentrate" by Billy Lemos (featuring Dua Saleh).<br/>
<br/>
Apple also shared a behind-the-scenes YouTube Short:<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[iOS 18 is widely expected to include <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/30/ios-18-rumor-recap-for-apps/">new generative AI features</a> for the iPhone, with a mix of on-device and cloud-based processing, and a new report has outlined Apple's alleged privacy measures for the cloud-based features.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/04/iOS-18-Siri-Integrated-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-945741" /><br/>
Apple's AI servers will supposedly be <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/06/apple-building-m2-ultra-and-m4-servers/">powered by a combination of M2 Ultra and M4 chips</a> that it uses in Macs and iPads. According to <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/apples-plan-to-protect-privacy-with-ai-putting-cloud-data-in-a-black-box"><em>The Information</em>'s Wayne Ma</a>, Apple plans to utilize the Secure Enclave in its chips "to help isolate the data being processed on its servers so that it can't be seen by the wider system or Apple." Technical details about the Secure Enclave are outlined <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/guide/security/sec59b0b31ff/web">in Apple's Platform Security Guide</a>.<br/>
<br/>
The report said this "confidential-computing approach" will have strong privacy protections:<blockquote>With the confidential-computing approach, Apple will be able to handle processing of AI-related data in the cloud while making it extremely difficult for hackers to gain access to the data even in the event of a data breach. It would also reduce Apple's burden of having to hand over personal data from its servers in the event of a government or law enforcement request.</blockquote><br/>
<br/>
The report added that Apple has a longer-term goal of offloading the processing power of future wearable devices to servers powered by Apple silicon chips. This move could allow Apple to design a thinner and lighter Vision Pro headset, or future Apple Glasses.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple, Google, and Amazon are urging India to reconsider its proposed Digital Competition Bill, citing concerns over increased user costs and potential reductions in investment (via <em><a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/google-amazon-apple-lobby-group-opposes-indias-eu-like-antitrust-proposal-2024-05-28/">Reuters</a></em>).<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/08/apple-india.jpg" alt="" width="2304" height="1296" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-756076" /><br/>
A U.S. lobby group representing major technology companies has asked the Indian government to rethink the proposed legislation that closely mirrors the European Union's Digital Markets Act. The request was made in a letter sent by the U.S.-India Business Council (USIBC), a part of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, to India's Corporate Affairs Ministry. The proposed Digital Competition Bill aims to regulate the market power of large digital firms with global revenues exceeding &#36;30 billion and at least 10 million local users.<br/>
<br/>
The Digital Competition Bill seeks to introduce measures to prevent companies from exploiting non-public user data and from giving preferential treatment to their own services over those of rivals. The bill would also remove restrictions on sideloading apps. <br/>
<br/>
The USIBC has raised concerns that these regulations could lead to significant repercussions for targeted companies like Apple. According to the council, the draft Indian law is "much further in scope" than the EU's regulations, potentially resulting in reduced investment in India, higher prices for digital services, and a decreased range of services available to consumers.<br/>
<br/>
The Indian government argues that the new law is necessary to address the growing market power of a few large digital companies that "wield immense control over the market." The proposed legislation includes provisions for penalties of up to 10 percent of a company's annual global turnover for violations.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/antitrust/">Apple Antitrust</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/india/">India</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/29/apple-pushes-back-against-india-regulations/">Apple Pushes Back Against India&#039;s New Digital Market Regulations</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-pushes-back-against-indias-new-digital-market-regulations.2427664/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It has been over a year and a half since the current Apple TV was released, so you may be wondering when a new model will be released. Below, we recap rumors about the next-generation Apple TV, including new features and lower pricing.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/10/apple-tv-4k-yellow-bg-feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-870258" /><br/>
The current Apple TV 4K was <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/10/18/apple-announces-apple-tv-with-a15-and-hdr10-for-129/">introduced in October 2022</a>. Key new features compared to the previous model from 2021 include a faster A15 Bionic chip, a larger 128GB storage option, a slightly thinner and lighter design, HDR10+ support, a USB-C port on the Siri Remote, a lower &#36;129 starting price vs. &#36;179, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/10/19/10-new-features-of-2022-apple-tv/">more</a>.<br/>
<br/>
In January 2023, <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman reported that a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/01/18/apple-tv-faster-chip-2024-launch/">new Apple TV was on track for release in the first half of 2024</a>:<blockquote>Beyond the future smart displays and new speaker, Apple is working on revamping its TV box. A new version with the current design is in the works for the first half of next year with a faster processor, the people said.</blockquote>With only one month remaining in the first half of 2024, it is unclear if this timeframe remains accurate. A new Apple TV could be unveiled at the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/28/wwdc-2024-full-schedule/">WWDC keynote on June 10</a>, but no hardware announcements have been firmly rumored for the event.<br/>
<br/>
Here is when the previous five Apple TV models were announced:<br/>
<br/>
<ul><li><strong>Third-generation Apple TV 4K:</strong> October 2022</li><br/>
<li><strong>Second-generation Apple TV 4K:</strong> April 2021</li><br/>
<li><strong>First-generation Apple TV 4K:</strong> September 2017</li><br/>
<li><strong>Apple TV HD:</strong> September 2015</li><br/>
<li><strong>Third-generation Apple TV:</strong> March 2012</li></ul><br/>
<br/>
Regardless of when it is unveiled, the next Apple TV is rumored to feature a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/01/18/apple-tv-faster-chip-2024-launch/">faster processor</a> than the current A15 Bionic chip, and even lower pricing. Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo suggested that the next Apple TV <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/10/18/kuo-even-cheaper-apple-tv/">could have a sub-&#36;100 starting price</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Both the second-generation (2010) and third-generation (2012) versions of the Apple TV were priced at &#36;99 in the U.S. at launch, and Apple eventually lowered the price of the third-generation model to &#36;69, so there is precedent for a sub-&#36;100 Apple TV that would better compete with low-priced streaming devices sold by Google, Amazon, and Roku.<br/>
<br/>
No major design changes have been rumored for the next Apple TV specifically, but Gurman said Apple has considered <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/07/apple-tv-with-camera-again-rumored/">adding a built-in camera</a> to a future model. tvOS 17 <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/use-iphone-facetime-camera-apple-tv/">added a FaceTime app to the Apple TV</a>, allowing for users to have video calls by using the rear camera on a connected iPhone or iPad. If the Apple TV gained a built-in camera, users would no longer need to rely on an external device for video calls on the TV.<br/>
<br/>
Should the WWDC keynote pass without any new Apple TV announcement, then there will no longer be any active rumor for when the next model might launch.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_TV">Apple TV (Caution)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-tv-and-home-theater.100">Apple TV and Home Theater</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/29/latest-apple-tv-rumors/">Apple TV: The Latest Rumors About a New Model and Possible &#36;99 Price</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-tv-the-latest-rumors-about-a-new-model-and-possible-99-price.2427662/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[iOS 18 will be unveiled at Apple's annual developers conference WWDC in less than two weeks, and the update will include some new features for CarPlay.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/Apple-CarPlay-Dash.jpg" alt="" width="1306" height="734" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-934995" /><br/>
Below, we recap new accessibility features that Apple recently previewed for CarPlay, and discuss the current status of the promised next-generation CarPlay.<br/>
<br/>
The first beta of iOS 18 will likely be made available to members of the Apple Developer Program immediately following the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/28/wwdc-2024-full-schedule/">WWDC keynote on June 10</a>, and a public beta is usually released in July, which will allow iPhone users to test out the new CarPlay features. As usual, the update should be widely released in September.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>New Accessibility Features</h2><br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/CarPlay-Sound-Recognition.jpg" alt="" width="1306" height="718" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-950848" /><em>Sound Recognition is coming to CarPlay</em></div><br/>
In a press release earlier this month, Apple highlighted <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/15/ios-18-accessibility-features-for-carplay/">three new accessibility features</a> coming to CarPlay as part of iOS 18:<br/>
<br/>
<ul><li><strong>Voice Control:</strong> This feature will allow users to navigate CarPlay and control apps with just their voice.</li><br/>
<li><strong>Color Filters:</strong> This feature will make the CarPlay interface visually easier to use for individuals with color blindness.</li><br/>
<li><strong>Sound Recognition:</strong> This feature will enable drivers or passengers who are deaf or hard of hearing to receive notifications on CarPlay for driving-related sounds, such as car horns and sirens.</li></ul>All three of these features are already available on the iPhone and iPad.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Next-Generation CarPlay</h2><br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/12/Next-Generation-CarPlay-Porsche-1.png" alt="" width="1200" height="675" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-927534" /><em>Porsche's next-generation CarPlay preview</em></div><br/>
It has been nearly two years since Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/06/06/apple-announces-multi-display-carplay/">first previewed next-generation CarPlay</a> at WWDC 2022, and it has still yet to become available in any vehicles.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="https://www.apple.com/ios/carplay/">Apple's website says</a> the first vehicle models with next-generation CarPlay will "arrive in 2024," but nothing has materialized yet. Aston Martin and Porsche <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/20/first-next-generation-carplay-vehicles-announced/">previewed next-generation CarPlay designs</a> in December, but Aston Martin has been silent ever since and Porsche continues to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/28/24166210/porsche-911-carrera-gts-hybrid-apple-carplay">release vehicles without next-generation CarPlay</a>. In addition, Mercedes-Benz has seemingly <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/29/24144356/mercedes-benz-ceo-apple-carplay-next-gen-decoder">reversed course on adopting next-generation CarPlay</a>, despite being on Apple's list of committed automakers shown at WWDC 2022.<br/>
<br/>
At this point, it is looking like next-generation CarPlay will debut with iOS 18, but it <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/25/ios-17-4-next-generation-carplay/">could be compatible with some iOS 17 versions</a> too.<br/>
<br/>
Apple said next-generation CarPlay will have deeper integration with a vehicle's instrument cluster, climate controls, FM radio, and more.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/carplay/">CarPlay</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/homepod-homekit-carplay-home-auto-technology.193">HomePod, HomeKit, CarPlay, Home & Auto Technology</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/29/what-to-expect-from-carplay-on-ios-18/">What to Expect From CarPlay on iOS 18</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/what-to-expect-from-carplay-on-ios-18.2427659/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Popular weather prediction app CARROT Weather was today updated to version 6.0, introducing a refreshed design with changes to the user interface and feature set. The app now features a garden, which is the new default look of the app.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/carrot-weather.png" alt="" width="3340" height="1878" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-952529" /><br/>
The garden is designed to grow and change over time, with little robots pruning trees, watering plants, and delivering supplies throughout the day. The garden resets at the start of each month for a dynamic experience throughout the year. While the garden is the default design, premium users can opt to keep their current layouts.<br/>
<br/>
CARROT Weather includes a new Hourly Forecast with a data point picker for selecting weather data that will show up on the main screen, plus there are more than a dozen layout options available in the Settings section of the app. Premium users can choose new styles for Weather Alerts, Minutely Forecast, Hourly Forecast, and Daily Forecast.<br/>
<br/>
The app includes weather news that provides insight into major weather events that are happening around the globe. Articles are sourced from Accuweather and stories for the local area will appear higher up in the layout. CARROT Weather is also gaining yesterday's temperature, which is a new popup that compares the current daily temperature with yesterday's weather when the app is first opened in the morning.<br/>
<br/>
CARROT Weather can be downloaded from the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a> for free, but unlocking additional features requires the premium version, priced starting at &#36;20/year.

		<description><![CDATA[Following a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/30/beats-solo-buds-announced/">late April announcement</a>, the upcoming <a href="https://www.beatsbydre.com/earbuds/ut-solo-buds-btd">Beats Solo Buds</a> will be available to order starting Tuesday, June 18, with a launch coming two days later on Thursday, June 20.<br/>
<br/>

Priced at &#36;79.99, Beats Solo Buds deliver 18 hours of battery life and come in the smallest case ever designed for Beats earbuds. The case does not contain its own battery, and an external power source must be connected to the case via USB-C to recharge the buds.<br/>
<br/>

Beats Solo Buds feature a custom-built acoustic architecture and an ergonomic design with four ear tip size options for a precise fit. There is no active noise cancelation on the Beats Solo Buds, but they do offer passive noise isolation to improve audio quality. A custom microphone design paired with an advanced noise-learning algorithm help deliver improved call quality.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple is set to open its <a href="https://www.apple.com/my/exchangetrx/">first retail store in Malaysia</a> on June 22, marking a significant expansion of its physical retail presence in south-east Asia. The new store will be located in Kuala Lumpur at The Exchange TRX mall.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/apple-trx-mall-16-9.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-952534" /><br/>
The store features a unique, tiered white pyramid architectural design. This will be the sixth <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-store/">Apple Store</a> in south-east Asia, following three in Singapore and two in Thailand.<br/>
<br/>
Apple now has a <a href="https://www.apple.com/my/exchangetrx/">webpage</a> for the store and shared a number of <a href="https://www.apple.com/my/exchangetrx/">wallpapers</a> for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>, and Mac to celebrate its opening, incorporating the Apple logo and the word "Jom," which means "let's go" or "come on" in Malay. <br/>
<br/>
While Apple does not manufacture iPhones in Malaysia, it does produce some Mac models in the country. Apple's decision to establish a retail store in Malaysia is part of its strategy to expand its retail footprint in key Asian markets, where it faces fierce competition from local tech companies.<br/>
<br/>

Job Simulator is a VR game where automation and robots have replaced all human jobs. Players can relive what it was like to work as a human with not-so historically accurate recreations of jobs that include an office worker, gourmet chef, and store clerk.<br/>
<br/>
The game uses hand tracking for control purposes, which means no controller is required. Hands can be used for interacting with, throwing, and smashing objects.<br/>
<br/>
Vacation Simulator is similar to Job Simulator, but it provides a simulated vacation experience. Activities include ice sculpting, swimming, knitting mittens, building snowhumans, doing yoga, painting, taking selfies, and more in forest, mountain, and beach scenes.<br/>
<br/>

Vacation Simulator and Job Simulator have previously been available on Steam VR, Oculus devices, and PlayStationVR, and were released in 2019 and 2016, respectively. <br/>
<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[T-Mobile <a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/news/business/uscellular-acquisition-operations-assets">today announced plans</a> to purchase UScellular's wireless operations for &#36;4.4 billion, a deal that includes UScellular's wireless customers, stores, and select cellular spectrum.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/T-Mobile-Generic-Feature-Pink-1.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-951944" /><br/>
According to T-Mobile, the purchase will provide millions of UScellular customers access to the T-Mobile network, improving connectivity in underserved rural areas. T-Mobile also plans to use the spectrum and wireless assets from UScellular to expand its home broadband offerings.<br/>
<br/>
T-Mobile's press release suggests that wireless customers across the United States will "benefit from enhanced choice and competition," wording aimed at the federal regulators who will need to approve the deal. UScellular will retain ownership of some of its spectrum and its towers, with T-Mobile planning to lease space on approximately 2,000 towers.<br/>
<br/>
UScellular customers will have the option to stay on their existing plans or move to an unlimited T-Mobile plan with no switching costs.<br/>
<br/>
T-Mobile has previously acquired MetroPCS and Sprint, with the latter merger <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2019/11/06/fcc-approves-t-mobile-sprint-merger/">occurring in 2020</a> after it was previously <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2017/11/04/sprint-t-mobile-call-off-merger/">called off in 2014</a>. U.S. regulators have been concerned with the lack of a fourth major carrier in the United States and could be hesitant to approve yet another T-Mobile purchase.<br/>
<br/>
T-Mobile says that the deal should close in mid-2025.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/28/tmobile-uscellular-acquisition/">T-Mobile Announces UScellular Acquisition, Promises Improved Connectivity in Rural Areas</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/t-mobile-announces-uscellular-acquisition-promises-improved-connectivity-in-rural-areas.2427618/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[YouTube is the latest company to introduce mobile games that are available outside of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a>, today announcing <a href="https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/youtube-playables/">the official launch</a> of "Playables" in the YouTube app.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/youtube-playables.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-952517" /><br/>
Playables are free games that can be played on the YouTube website or in the YouTube app for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>. There are more than 75 games available, including Angry Birds Showdown and Cut the Rope.<br/>
<br/>
YouTube is focusing on "lightweight, entertaining games," so many of the options are games that are meant to be played for a short period of time rather than longer games that you might find on the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj;. Game progress is saved, and YouTube keeps track of all-time best scores.<br/>
<br/>
Playables have been available for a small number of users in select markets as YouTube has tested the feature, but as of today, the games are rolling out to everyone and are more widely available. Playables can be accessed in the iOS app by going to the Explore menu and choosing the Playables section.<br/>
<br/>
Netflix has offered a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/14/netflix-games-tvs-macs-pcs/">selection of in-app games</a> since 2021, and has started testing games on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a> as well. Other companies like The New York Times also offer dedicated games.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/youtube/">YouTube</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/28/youtube-playables/">YouTube Launches &#039;Playables&#039; Mobile Games for iOS</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/youtube-launches-playables-mobile-games-for-ios.2427617/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[LEGO has an "Ideas" website that allows fans to submit mockups and suggestions for future LEGO sets, and one fan recently <a href="https://ideas.lego.com/projects/798c9236-c87f-40be-a740-3166f919c8b6">designed a detailed Apple Store</a> that any Apple enthusiast would love to build.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/lego-apple-store.jpg" alt="" width="1350" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-952512" /><br/>
The LEGO <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-store/">Apple Store</a>'s design isn't made to resemble a specific store, but instead uses the design elements that Apple has incorporated into many of its locations. There's an all-glass facade with trees in pots, minifigures in classic Apple blue shirts, and an upstairs area reached by a set of stairs.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/lego-apple-store-exterior.jpg" alt="" width="1350" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-952513" /><br/>
Inside, there are tables with different iPhones and Macs on display, a section for headphones, and product boxes on shelves. There's also a colorful display upstairs, a big white Apple logo at the front of the store, and exterior area housing large versions of some of Apple's most iconic products.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/lego-apple-store-inside.jpg" alt="" width="1350" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-952514" /><br/>
If the LEGO &zwnj;Apple Store&zwnj; gets 10,000 "supporters" or votes on the LEGO ideas site, LEGO will review it and will consider it for an official retail set. It is unclear if Apple would approve such a set, and it is unknown if it will pass LEGO's review. LEGO evaluates submissions based on existing products, products already in development, brand fit, expected demand, licensing possibilities, build quality, and more.<br/>
<br/>
The set comes from Legotruman, who has had several other ideas reviewed by LEGO staff, and who was responsible for <a href="https://ideas.lego.com/projects/acc7c4c8-3967-4563-8fb5-a49859fa7755">the Starry Night LEGO</a> set that is now available for sale.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/lego/">LEGO</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/28/lego-apple-store/">Check Out This LEGO Apple Store</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/check-out-this-lego-apple-store.2427611/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today stopped signing iOS 17.5, preventing <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> users from downgrading to that version of iOS. The update is no longer being signed after the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/20/apple-releases-ios-17-5-1-photos-bug/">May 20 release of iOS 17.5.1</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/iOS-17.5-Feature-Green-and-Purple.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-940351" /><br/>
It is not unusual for Apple to stop signing an older version of iOS, and it typically happens a week or two after a new version of iOS comes out. When an update is no longer signed, it means it is no longer able to be installed on an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; per a server side software verification check.<br/>
<br/>
Apple prevents users from installing older versions of iOS to encourage customers to keep their operating systems up to date with the latest security improvements.<br/>
<br/>
iOS 17.5.1 addressed a corruption bug that could cause <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/20/apple-releases-ios-17-5-1-photos-bug/">deleted photos to reappear on an iPhone</a>.

		<title>Nomad Launches Qi-Rechargeable Find My Tracking Card to Prevent Lost Wallets</title>

		<description><![CDATA[Nomad today announced the launch of the <a href="https://nomadgoods.com/products/tracking-card">Tracking Card</a>, a super thin Find My-enabled card that is designed to be carried in a wallet so that it's trackable with an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/nomad-tracking-card.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-952503" /><br/>
The Tracking Card is about the thickness of two credit cards (2mm), so it doesn't take up too much space in a wallet. It's also credit card sized, which means it can be carried right alongside other cards. There are several <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/find-my-network-accessory-program/">Find My</a> cards on the market now, and 2mm is among the thinnest that are available. The Eufy SmartTrack, Chipolo CARD Spot, and Tile Slim are all a bit thicker.<br/>
<br/>
One side of the black plastic card is largely plain except for a logo, and the other side has a second subtle Nomad logo with light gray lines representing the hardware that's inside the card. It's not identifiable as a &zwnj;Find My&zwnj; tracking card, so if someone steals your wallet, it won't immediately tip the thief off that it's trackable. It actually looks a lot like a key card.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/nomad-tracking-card-2.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-952504" /><br/>
There's a hidden button on the card that's pressed to add it to &zwnj;Find My&zwnj;, and adding it to the app is as simple as opening it up, pressing the "+" button, and then holding down the pairing button on the Tracking Card. From there, it can be given a name and an icon, and it's trackable right alongside other &zwnj;Find My&zwnj; items and also Apple devices with &zwnj;Find My&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
Nomad's Tracking Card connects to the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; over Bluetooth, but it is also able to take advantage of the full &zwnj;Find My&zwnj; network, utilizing nearby Apple devices if it is out of range of your own &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;. &zwnj;Find My&zwnj; provides the current location if it's with you, or the Tracking Card's last known location if it's been located with the &zwnj;Find My&zwnj; network.<br/>
<br/>
When nearby, the Tracking Card can play a sound via &zwnj;Find My&zwnj;, which is helpful for locating your wallet if it's been misplaced in the home or nearby. There is no Precision Finding as there is with Apple devices, so the &zwnj;Find My&zwnj; app can't lead you directly to the Tracking Card. The beeping is not loud enough to hear it from another room in most cases, especially if it's buried in couch cushions or similarly hidden, but it should be loud enough if you're in the same room with the card.<br/>
<br/>
You can set the Tracking Card to notify you if it's left behind, which means it sends an alert when your &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; gets out of range. That's perhaps the most useful feature of the &zwnj;Find My&zwnj; network because it lets you know right away if you've misplaced or dropped something.<br/>
<br/>
There are options to get directions to the Tracking Card in the &zwnj;Find My&zwnj; app, plus you can share it with family members so they can track it and Lost Mode is available for adding your contact information should your wallet be lost. As with other &zwnj;Find My&zwnj; accessories, Nomad is able to deliver firmware updates should new software be needed.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps the best feature of the Tracking Card is the battery. The battery inside can be recharged by putting the card on a Qi-based charger, and the markings on the card show the alignment. I tested the card with several Qi/<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe-battery-pack/">MagSafe</a> chargers and they were all able to provide power, with charging indicated by a small red LED on the card. The light turns green when it's fully charged, and turns off when there's no charger connected. There is a small amount of metal inside, but it's enough that it's able to be attached to upright chargers as well as flat chargers. There isn't a magnet in the card so it's not going to affect the magnetic stripe on credit and debit cards. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/nomad-tracking-card-3.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-952505" /><br/>
According to Nomad, a single charge should last for around five months, so it isn't going to need to be charged often. Nomad says IPX7 waterproofing is included, so if the card happens to get wet, it'll survive.<br/>
<br/>
Many of the wallet-sized Bluetooth trackers on the market do not have a rechargeable or replaceable battery inside, so it's nice that Nomad has designed the Tracking Card to last more than a couple of years. With the Chipolo Card Spot or Eufy SmartTrack, the entire device needs to be thrown out when the built-in battery dies.<br/>
<br/>
At &#36;40, Nomad's Tracking Card is about &#36;10 more expensive than some competing products from well-known companies like Chipolo, but it does have built-in wireless charging and a slim design. There are some &zwnj;Find My&zwnj; wallet tracking cards <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FReyke-Tracker-Wireless-Charging-Passports%2Fdp%2FB0CT38WDJC%2F">on Amazon</a> with the same Qi technology for around &#36;10 to &#36;15 less, so Qi charging for trackers isn't a totally new idea. Of course, these are not known Apple accessory makers so quality and functionality is unverified, plus the reviews are mixed, but there are other options out there.<br/>
<br/>
Note that like all &zwnj;Find My&zwnj; Bluetooth tracking accessories, the Tracking Card from Nomad only works with Apple devices. It cannot be used on the Android platform.<br/>
<br/>
Nomad's Tracking Card can be <a href="https://nomadgoods.com/products/tracking-card">purchased from the Nomad website</a> as of today.<br/>
