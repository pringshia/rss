		<description><![CDATA[Supplies of the sixth-generation <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-mini/">iPad mini</a> are dwindling at "many" Apple retail stores, which is a sign that a new model could be coming, according to <em>Bloomberg</em>'s <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/10/ipad-mini-blue.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-868315" /><br/>
Gurman <a href="https://x.com/markgurman/status/1828188631015792709">said in a tweet</a> that the &zwnj;iPad mini&zwnj; is considered "constrained" internally at Apple, and that might be an indication that a refresh is on the horizon. The sixth-generation &zwnj;iPad mini&zwnj; was initially introduced in September 2021, so it almost three years old at this point.<br/>
<br/>
Apple has been working on a seventh-generation version of the &zwnj;iPad mini&zwnj;, and rumors have suggested that it <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/13/ipad-mini-7-not-expected-before-late-2024/">could come out this year</a>. The next &zwnj;iPad mini&zwnj; is expected to include an A17 Pro or better chip to support Apple Intelligence, along with updated front and rear cameras. Updates that Apple has been making across its product lineup could also be included, such as Wi-Fi 6E and Bluetooth 5.3.<br/>
<br/>
Apple today announced plans to hold a fall iPhone-centric event on September 9 to introduce the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a> models, new Apple Watch models, and new AirPods. It is not clear if Apple will also refresh the &zwnj;iPad mini&zwnj; at that time, but Apple could hold a new version for a second fall event or announcement.<br/>
<br/>
We are still counting on several M4 Macs this year, so there will likely be some kind of second announcement. Apple is rumored to be planning to refresh the MacBook Pro, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-mini/">Mac mini</a>, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/">iMac</a> with M4 chips, so an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> with a similar A-series chip would fit in with those announcements.<br/>
<br/>
Apple updated the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a> models with M4 chips earlier this year, and introduced a two versions of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/">iPad Air</a> with an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m2/">M2</a> chip.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-mini/">iPad mini</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPad_Mini">iPad Mini (Don't Buy)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipad.137">iPad</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/26/ipad-mini-stock-dwindling/">iPad Mini Stock Dwindling at Apple Stores, Refresh Could Be Coming</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ipad-mini-stock-dwindling-at-apple-stores-refresh-could-be-coming.2434457/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple recently <a href="https://www.apple.com/retail/bridgestreet/">announced</a> that its retail store at the Bridge Street Town Centre in Huntsville, Alabama will be opening in a new location within the outdoor shopping complex on Saturday, August 31, at 10 a.m. local time.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/08/Apple-Store-Bridge-Street.jpeg" alt="" width="2880" height="1612" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-962424" /><em>The original Apple Bridge Street</em></div><br/>
As noted in <a href="https://michaelsteeber.substack.com/p/a-different-kind-of-store">Michael Steeber's weekly newsletter about Apple retail</a>, the new store will be located just a few units down from Apple's existing store at Bridge Street Town Centre, next to Athleta. The new location will be significantly larger and have a more modern design compared to the original, which first opened its doors back in 2008.<br/>
<br/>
This will be Apple's first new store opening around the world since the company <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/29/apple-to-open-first-retail-store-in-malaysia/">opened its first store in Malaysia</a> in late June.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-store/">Apple Store</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/26/apple-bridge-street-store-relocating/">Apple Store in Southeastern U.S. Relocating Later This Week</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-store-in-southeastern-u-s-relocating-later-this-week.2434440/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Following <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/26/apple-september-9-iphone-event/">this morning's announcement</a> of an upcoming iPhone-centric event that's set to take place on September 9 at 10:00 a.m. Pacific Time, Apple has added an event placeholder on its YouTube channel.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe title="Apple Event - September 9" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uarNiSl_uh4" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div><br/>
Apple plans to stream the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> event on YouTube, on its website, and through the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a> app. There's also an event placeholder on <a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-events/">the Apple Events site</a>. For YouTube, users can click on the video placeholder and choose the "Notify me" option to get a notification when the livestream is up.<br/>
<br/>
If YouTube has your location information, the notification and countdown are in local time, so it's a good way to double check when you'll need to tune in to see Apple's announcements. Apple almost always holds events at 10:00 a.m. Pacific Time, which is 1:00 p.m. Eastern Time, evening in Europe, and early morning in countries in Asia and Australia.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-events/">Apple's Events website</a> also has an option to add the event to your calendar for a cross-platform reminder.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Over two and a half years have passed since Apple released the current iPhone SE, so the device is due for an update. Below, we recap the latest rumors about the next-generation iPhone SE, including potential features and launch timing.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/iPhone-SE-4-Thumb-1.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-951978" /><br/>
<h2>Timing</h2><br/>
The latest word <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-08-25/apple-plans-tabletop-robot-while-exploring-mobile-bots-and-humanoid-machines-m09kawex">comes from <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman</a>. In his <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-08-25/apple-plans-tabletop-robot-while-exploring-mobile-bots-and-humanoid-machines-m09kawex"><em>Power On</em> newsletter</a> on Sunday, he said he expects the next iPhone SE to launch in the spring of 2025. All three existing iPhone SE models were announced in March over the years, so it seems likely that the fourth-generation model will also be introduced in March next year.<br/>
<br/>
Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo and the technology publication <em>The Information</em> also previously claimed that the next iPhone SE will launch <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/24/kuo-iphone-se-4-thin-iphone-17-apple-5g-chip/">in the first quarter of 2025</a>, so that timeframe has been corroborated by multiple sources. <em>The Information</em> said that Apple suppliers would begin ramping up mass production of the device <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/23/iphone-se-4-october-production-report/">in October</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Features</h2><br/>
The current iPhone SE starts at &#36;429 in the U.S. with 64GB of storage and 4GB of RAM. The device's key features include a 4.7-inch LCD display, A15 Bionic chip, Touch ID, 5G support with a Qualcomm chip, a single 12-megapixel rear camera, and a Lightning port.<br/>
<br/>
The next iPhone SE is rumored to have an iPhone 14-like design with the following features:<br/>
<ul><li>6.1-inch OLED display</li><br/>
<li>A18 chip</li><br/>
<li>Face ID</li><br/>
<li>USB-C port</li><br/>
<li>Action button</li><br/>
<li>Apple-designed 5G chip</li><br/>
<li>A single 48-megapixel rear camera</li><br/>
<li>8GB of RAM for Apple Intelligence</li><br/>
</ul>Gurman believes the next iPhone SE will likely be priced in the &#36;400 to &#36;500 range, so the device would remain a lower-cost option in Apple's smartphone lineup, despite gaining a larger display and a more modern set of features.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-se/">iPhone SE</a></div><div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/bloomberg-com/">Bloomberg</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone_SE">iPhone SE (Don't Buy)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99">iPhone</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/26/when-to-expect-iphone-se-4/">When to Expect the iPhone SE 4 to Launch</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/when-to-expect-the-iphone-se-4-to-launch.2434435/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today announced plans to hold its annual iPhone-centric event on Monday, September 9 at the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-park/">Apple Park</a> campus in Cupertino, California. The event is set to start at 10:00 a.m., and select members of the media have been invited to attend.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yU9iK5Ql0AE" title="Apple Announces iPhone 16 &quot;It&#39;s Glowtime&quot; Event!" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/macrumors?sub_confirmation=1">Subscribe to the MacRumors YouTube channel</a> for more videos.</em></div><br/>
This year's event will see Apple unveil the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a> lineup, new Apple Watch models, and the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airpods-4/">AirPods 4</a>, plus we'll get official launch dates for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sequoia/">macOS Sequoia</a>, and Apple's other software updates.<br/>
<br/>
All four of the new iPhones are expected to have the customizable Action Button and a new Capture Button for taking photos that will have built-in gestures, such as a swipe for zooming in and out or a soft press for autofocus. The Capture Button will be on the right side of the devices below the power button.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">We’re glowing with excitement! Monday, September 9. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/AppleEvent?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#AppleEvent</a> <a href="https://t.co/QRVyZtqXYA">pic.twitter.com/QRVyZtqXYA</a></p>&mdash; Greg Joswiak (@gregjoz) <a href="https://twitter.com/gregjoz/status/1828104913425215680?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 26, 2024</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div><br/>
Apple is also adding an A18 chip to all models, so the entire &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; lineup will be capable of supporting the Apple Intelligence features that are coming in &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj;. No other major new features are expected for the standard &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; models, but the Pro lineup will get an increase in display size, going from 6.1 and 6.7 inches to 6.3 and 6.9 inches, respectively, for the Pro and Pro Max. Both models will also include the 5x Telephoto zoom option that was exclusive to the Pro Max last year. <br/>
<br/>
For the Apple Watch, the standard Series 10 is expected to feature a thinner design with a larger display, but the change won't be radical. Apple also plans to refresh the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch-se/">Apple Watch SE</a> and the Apple Watch Ultra, and we could see new health features such as sleep apnea detection and blood pressure monitoring, but it is not yet entirely clear if Apple will have them ready in time for this year's launch.<br/>
<br/>
There are two models of the &zwnj;AirPods 4&zwnj; coming, one that's a direct successor to the current <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods/">AirPods 3</a> and one that's a step up with support for Active Noise Cancellation at a non-Pro price. <br/>
<br/>
Apple plans to stream the fall event <a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-events/">live on its website</a>, on YouTube, and through the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a> app. For those unable to watch, MacRumors will be providing full event coverage on MacRumors.com and the <a href="https://twitter.com/macrumorslive">MacRumorsLive Twitter account</a>.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods/">AirPods 3</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch/">Apple Watch Series 9</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch-se/">Apple Watch SE</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch-ultra/">Apple Watch Ultra 2</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/">iPhone 16 Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/september-2024-apple-event/">September 2024 Apple Event</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AirPods">AirPods (Don't Buy)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch">Apple Watch (Don't Buy)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch_SE">Apple Watch SE (Don't Buy)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch_Ultra">Apple Watch Ultra (Don't Buy)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/airpods.216">AirPods</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-watch.172">Apple Watch</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/26/apple-september-9-iphone-event/">Apple Event Announced for September 9: &#039;It&#039;s Glowtime&#039;</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-event-announced-for-september-9-its-glowtime.2434429/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple in iOS 18 has made a wealth of customization options available for your iPhone Home Screen, one of which is the ability to add a tint to your app icons.  <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/iOS-18-Home-Screen-Feature-1.5.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-957459" /><br/>
Essentially, the tint feature offers a unique way to customize your device's appearance by changing the color of all your icons at once. Unlike individual icon customization, tinting affects every icon on your app pages, Home Screen, and App Library, creating a unified look across your entire interface.<br/>
<br/>
Tinting works by first desaturating all icons and then applying a single color overlay. This process results in a monochromatic appearance, which means you'll lose the original colors of your app icons and widgets, but what you gain is a more cohesive look. It's a powerful tool for creating a coordinated, stylish interface that reflects your personal taste, so be sure to experiment with it.<br/>
<br/>
To choose a tint color, you can also use an eyedropper tool to select a shade from your wallpaper, or manually adjust hue and saturation using two slider bars. This flexibility allows you to perfectly match your icons to your background or create a contrasting color scheme.<br/>
<br/>
Lastly, it's important to remember that the tint setting is universal. You can't apply different tints to different app pages or sections of your device. Whatever color you choose will be applied everywhere icons appear. Here's how to tint your icons in iOS 18:<br/>
<ol><br/>
  <li>Long press a space on your Home Screen.</li><br/>
  <li>Tap <strong>Edit</strong> in the top-right corner.</li><br/>
  <li>Tap <strong>Customize</strong>.</li><br/>
  <li>Select the <strong>Tinted</strong> option.</li><br/>
  <li>Adjust the sliders to change the tint. Note that you can also use the eyedropper icon to select a hue from a region of your wallpaper.</li><br/>
  <li>Tap anywhere outside of the Customize panel to finish.</li><br/>
</ol><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/08/tint-home-screen-icons-ios.jpg" alt="Home Screen" width="4377" height="2796" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-962386" /><br/>
<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Pavel Durov, the 39-year-old Russian-born billionaire founder and CEO of <a href="https://telegram.org">Telegram</a>, was arrested at Le Bourget airport outside Paris late Saturday evening. The arrest occurred shortly after Durov arrived on a private jet from Azerbaijan and is said to be part of a joint investigation by several agencies investigating alleged failures in content moderation on the Telegram platform that may have facilitated criminal activity. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/08/telegram-app-icon.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-857787" /><br/>
According to sources who spoke to <em><a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/telegram-messaging-app-ceo-pavel-durov-arrested-france-tf1-tv-says-2024-08-24/">Reuters</a></em>, French authorities had spotted Durov on the passenger list and moved to arrest him due to an existing warrant. Several French TV reports said that authorities have been investigating Telegram's alleged moderation failures, which they believe may have facilitated a range of illegal activities, including terrorism, drug trafficking, money laundering, fraud, and child exploitation.<br/>
<br/>
Telegram, which is based in Dubai, responded to Durov's arrest by stating that the company "abides by EU laws, including the Digital Services Act" and that its moderation practices are "within industry standards and constantly improving." The company emphasized that Durov "has nothing to hide and travels frequently in Europe," calling it "absurd to claim that a platform or its owner are responsible for abuse of that platform."<br/>
<br/>
The arrest has drawn criticism from various quarters, including X (Twitter) owner Elon Musk, who has posted the hashtag "<a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1827572720936030703">#FreePavel</a>" on the platform, and has previously claimed that free speech is under attack in Europe. Russian officials have also expressed their concern, with the foreign ministry demanding consular access to Durov, who holds dual French and UAE citizenship.<br/>
<br/>
Durov, often referred to as the "Russian Mark Zuckerberg," founded Telegram in 2013 after leaving Russia due to conflicts with authorities over his refusal to shut down opposition communities on his previous social media platform, VK. In 2018, Russia began blocking Telegram after the app refused to grant state security services access to users' messages, but the ban was lifted in 2020 when Telegram agreed to help with "extremism investigations." Telegram has since grown to nearly 1 billion users and has become a crucial communication tool, particularly in Ukraine since Russia's invasion in 2022.<br/>
<br/>
The Telegram chief's arrest has also put Telegram's encryption practices under the spotlight again. Despite being widely described as an "encrypted messaging app," Telegram's default settings for most users <a href="https://x.com/matthew_d_green/status/1789687898863792453">do not provide end-to-end encryption</a>. Unlike WhatsApp and Signal, one-on-one chats are not encrypted by default, and group chats are never encrypted. This means that Telegram staff potentially have access to every message sent in these chats, which may be why Russia is so concerned about the arrest.<br/>
<br/>
For users seeking true end-to-end encryption on Telegram, it must be manually configured as a "secret chat," a process that is not all that straightforward. Not only that, these "secret" group chats are limited to only two users, which raises questions about the platform's efforts to protect user privacy.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/encryption/">Encryption</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/privacy/">Privacy</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/telegram/">Telegram</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/26/telegram-ceo-arrested-content-moderation-issues/">Telegram CEO Arrested in France Over Content Moderation Issues</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/telegram-ceo-arrested-in-france-over-content-moderation-issues.2434407/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<title>Both iPhone 16 Pro Models to Use Telephoto Lens From Same Supplier</title>

		<description><![CDATA[This year, Apple will bring the Tetraprism Telephoto lens that was exclusive to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a> Max to both <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/">iPhone 16 Pro</a> models, and a new report out of Korea claims that Apple will initially rely on the same supplier as it did in 2023 for the required folded zoom modules. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/02/iPhone-15-Pro-Periscope-Mock-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-884862" /><br/>
According to <em><a href="https://www.thelec.net/news/articleView.html?idxno=4948">The Elec</a></em>, LG Innotek will provide the modules for the initial stock of &zwnj;iPhone 16 Pro&zwnj; models, which are expected to launch on Friday, September 20. The telephoto camera has a folded glass structure below the lens, which Apple refers to as Tetraprism technology. It reflects light four times over, allowing for a longer focal length of 120mm. The &zwnj;iPhone 16 Pro&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPhone 16 Pro&zwnj; Max will both offer 5x optical zoom and 25x digital zoom.<br/>
<br/>
Apple uses 3D sensor-shift optical image stabilization for the Telephoto lens in the Pro Max, and because it is able to move in three directions, it delivers twice as many micro-adjustments as before for crisp photos even when zoomed all the way in.<br/>
<br/>
When initial stock is spent, which is expected to be around the fourth quarter, Apple will reportedly use its secondary vendors Foxconn and Cowell to manufacture the folded zoom module as well to drive down costs. Meanwhile, Sharp is not expected to supply any camera modules for any iPhones launching the year.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/">iPhone 16 Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/26/iphone-16-pro-telephoto-lens-both-models/">Both iPhone 16 Pro Models to Use Telephoto Lens From Same Supplier</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/both-iphone-16-pro-models-to-use-telephoto-lens-from-same-supplier.2434402/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple is likely to launch its new iPhone 16 lineup in stores on Friday, September 20, and the company has Apple already sent out media invites for its iPhone announcement on Monday, with the tagline "<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/26/apple-september-9-iphone-event/">It's Glowtime.</a>"<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/12/iPhone-16-Pro-Sizes-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-927877" /><br/>
Apple plans to introduce the iPhone 16 models, along with the next-generation Apple Watch models, as well as new AirPods. <br/>
<br/>
<h2>iPhone 16: What to Expect</h2><br/>
The iPhone 16 series is anticipated to bring a host of new features and enhancements. Here's a sneak peek into what we can expect:<br/>
<br/>
<h3>Bigger Display</h3><br/>
<ul><br/>
    <li>While the external designs are not expected to undergo major overall changes, we are expecting slight <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/16/iphone-16-display-sizes/">increases in display size</a> and a new aspect ratio for the iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max models.</li><br/>
    <li>A new Capture Button will be included on all four iPhone 16 models, and it will be used for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/17/iphone-16-capture-button-video/">taking photos and videos</a> with more nuanced control.<br/>
</ul><br/>
<br/>
<h3>Design Changes</h3><br/>
<ul><br/>
<li>The standard iPhone 16 models are expected to have a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/22/iphone-16-vertical-camera-lenses-rumor/">vertical camera layout</a>. Apple has used a diagonal layout for more recent iPhone models, but the swap may allow for spatial video recording using the Ultrawide and Wide cameras.</li><br/>
<li>The iPhone 15 Pro models include an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/21/iphone-16-everything-new-action-button-will-do/">Action Button</a>, and in 2024, the Action Button is expected to be expanded to the standard iPhone 16 models. The Action Button used across the iPhone 16 lineup will be identical to the iPhone 15 Pro Action Button. The Action button, which replaces the traditional mute switch, can perform multiple functions such as activating the Flashlight, turning on the Camera, launching a Shortcut, enabling or disabling a Focus mode, using Translate, turning on/off Silent Mode, and more.<br/>
</li></ul><br/>
<br/>
<h3>Apple Intelligence and Improved Siri</h3><br/>
<ul><br/>
<li>With iOS 18.1, Apple will introduce Apple Intelligence, a suit of AI tools powered by large language models. Apple Intelligence only works with current iPhone 15 Pro models, and some of the more cutting-edge generative AI features could be <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/09/iphone-16-exclusive-ai-features-ios-18/">limited to the iPhone 16 models</a> further down the line.</li><br/>
    <li>The iPhone 16 models are rumored to feature an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/07/apple-iphone-16-microphone-upgrade-siri-ai/">upgraded microphone</a> in order to enhance the Siri experience significantly. This improvement is in line with the expected integration of iOS 18's new Apple Intelligence functionalities, offering better interactions between Siri and various apps.</li><br/>
</ul><br/>
<br/>
<h3>New Camera Technology</h3><br/>
<ul><br/>
    <li>Photography enthusiasts can look forward to an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/18/iphone-16-pro-rumored-to-feature-48mp-ultra-wide/">improved 48-megapixel Ultra Wide lens</a> in the iPhone 16 Pro models, promising better image quality, especially in lower lighting conditions.</li><br/>
    <li>Additionally, both the iPhone 16 Pro and Pro Max are rumored to include <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/01/both-iphone-16-pro-models-tetraprism-zoom-lens/">5x Telephoto lenses</a>, a feature previously limited to the larger iPhone 15 Pro Max model.</li><br/>
</ul><br/>
<br/>
<h3>Battery Innovations</h3><br/>
<ul><br/>
    <li>Expectations are high for the iPhone 16 Pro models to utilize <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/07/25/iphone-15-hybrid-lens-rumor/">stacked battery technology</a>, which could lead to higher capacity and longer lifespan.</li><br/>
    <li>This technology might be complemented by <a href="https://twitter.com/RGcloudS/status/1681431058607407104?s=20">faster wired and wireless MagSafe charging</a> capabilities.</li><br/>
</ul><br/>
<br/>
<h3>Processor Upgrades</h3><br/>
<ul><br/>
    <li>The iPhone 16 Pro and Max models will be powered by the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/27/iphone-16-lineup-a18-a18-pro-chips-analyst-says/">A18 Pro processor</a>, offering modest speed improvements and an enhanced Neural Engine, as well as support for advanced generative AI capabilities.</li><br/>
    <li>The standard models are expected to use a variant of the new A18 chip, but the exact specifications have yet to be confirmed.</li><br/>
</ul><br/>
<br/>
<h3>Other Rumored Features</h3><br/>
<ul><br/>
    <li>The iPhone 16 Pro Max could be the first to feature a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/07/18/iphone-16-pro-max-super-telephoto-camera/">super telephoto periscope camera</a> for dramatically increased optical zoom.</li><br/>
<li>The iPhone 16 Pro models <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/12/iphone-16-pro-5g-advanced-rumor/">could be equipped</a> with Qualcomm's Snapdragon X75 modem, allowing for faster and more efficient 5G connectivity. </li><br/>
<li>Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo believes the iPhone 16 Pro models <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/06/19/iphone-15-new-u1-chip-vision-pro-headset/">could adopt</a> the net-generation WiFi 7 technology, which is expected to provide speeds of "at least 30" gigabits per second, and could hit up to 40Gb/s.</li><br/>

		<description><![CDATA[All of Apple's upcoming new Macs this year are likely to have at least 16GB of RAM pre-installed as standard, breaking a years-long tradition of Apple offering just 8GB of RAM in most of its base Macs and forcing customers to pay out an extra &#36;200+ for additional memory.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/08/M4-Mac-mini-Silver-Ortho-Cooler.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-961274" /><br/>
The adequacy of 8GB of RAM in Macs has been a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/is-8gb-of-ram-enough-for-macbook-pro/#:~:text=8GB%20or%20More%20RAM%3F,run%20smoothly%20even%20during%20multitasking.">contentious issue</a> for over a decade. The debate traces back to 2012 when Apple introduced the first Retina MacBook Pro with 8GB RAM as standard. Remarkably, Apple still continues to offer 8GB as the base memory configuration for several models, including the M3 14-inch MacBook Pro, M3 iMac, and M3 MacBook Airs. <br/>
<br/>
However, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-08-23/when-is-apple-announcing-the-iphone-16-apple-planning-event-on-sept-10-2024"><em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman</a> reports that Apple is testing four new Mac models equipped with an M4 chip, and all of them have either 16GB or 32GB of unified memory. Gurman previously reported that Apple is planning to refresh the MacBook Pro, Mac mini, and iMac with M4 chips this year. One possibility is that Apple has deemed that 16GB of RAM should be the new workable minimum for future AI features introduced under the Apple Intelligence banner, but that is merely speculation at this point.<br/>
<br/>
Last year, Apple introduced a base 14-inch MacBook Pro with M3 chip, which replaced the discontinued M2 13-inch MacBook Pro in Apple's Mac lineup. Starting at &#36;1,599, the 14-inch M3 MacBook Pro comes with 8GB of unified memory. Users can opt for 16GB or 24GB at checkout, but these configuration options cost an extra &#36;200 and &#36;400 at purchase, respectively, and cannot be upgraded at a later date because of Apple's unified memory architecture.<br/>
<ul><li><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/is-8gb-of-ram-enough-for-macbook-pro/">Is 8GB of RAM Enough for a Mac in 2024?</a></li></ul><br/>
This has left Apple open to criticism from users who believe that 8GB is not a sufficient amount of RAM for most creative professional workflows, and that 16GB should be the bare minimum for a machine that is marketed as "Pro," rather than an additional several hundred dollar outlay. Apple previously <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/08/8gb-ram-m3-macbook-pro-like-16-gb-pc/">argued</a> that 8GB on an M3 MacBook Pro is probably analogous to 16GB on other computers because of the efficiency gains of using unified architecture. Needless to say, that argument failed to resonate with many creative professionals, and so the news that 16GB is likely to be the new minimum will surely be a welcome development.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/">iMac</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro/">MacBook Pro 14 & 16" </a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-mini/">Mac mini</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iMac">iMac (Neutral)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Pro_16">14" & 16" MacBook Pro (Caution)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Mac_Mini">Mac Mini (Caution)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/imac.91">iMac</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macbook-pro.90">MacBook Pro</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/mac-mini.146">Mac mini</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/26/apple-new-macs-16gb-ram-standard/">16GB of RAM Could Be the New Minimum in Apple&#039;s Upcoming M4 Macs</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/16gb-of-ram-could-be-the-new-minimum-in-apples-upcoming-m4-macs.2434398/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's annual iPhone event is coming up quickly, and things are starting to firm up regarding what we might see and when.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/08/top-stories-24aug2024.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-962303" /><br/>
Beyond the iPhone and other updates expected next month, we're also looking toward some Mac updates later in the year while Apple appears to be moving forward on its tabletop robot project, so read on below for all the details!<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Apple Expected to Debut iPhone 16, Apple Watch 10, and AirPods 4 on September 10</h2><br/>
Apple plans to hold an event to introduce the iPhone 16 models, the next-generation Apple Watch models, and new AirPods <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/23/apple-to-debut-new-iphones-september-10/">on Tuesday, September 10,</a> according to <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/iPhone-16-Camera-Lozenge-2.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-935160" /><br/>
After the September 10 unveiling, the devices will launch on Friday, September 20. With that timeline, we can expect new software like iOS 18 and macOS Sequoia to come out a few days ahead of the September 20 hardware launch.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>iPhone 16 Launch Is Next Month – Here's Everything We Know</h2><br/>
With the iPhone 16 lineup being officially unveiled in just a few weeks, we've <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/19/iphone-16-launch-everything-we-know/">recapped many of the rumors</a> we've heard about the devices, so check it out for a refresher as Apple's big event approaches.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/12/iPhone-16-Pro-Sizes-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-927877" /><br/>
We're expecting bigger sizes for the Pro models, a new Capture button, and an array of other improvements. On the color front, we're expecting a new bronze or gold shade potentially called Desert Titanium to replace the Blue Titanium option from the iPhone 15 Pro lineup.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Apple's September Event: New Products to Expect Beyond the iPhone 16</h2><br/>
While the iPhone is always the highlight of Apple's annual September events, the company typically makes a number of other introductions and announcements.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/Apple-Event-October-2023.jpeg" alt="" width="2048" height="1152" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-919098" /><br/>
We've <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/21/apple-september-2024-event-new-products-expected/">rounded up what else we might see</a> at next month's event, ranging from new Apple Watch models to updated AirPods and more, so check out our full list!<br/>
<br/>
<h2>These New Macs Are Coming in 2024</h2><br/>
With September expected to see the usual iPhone and Apple Watch focus, that doesn't mean Apple is ignoring the Mac lineup.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/08/M4-Mac-mini-Silver-Ortho-Cooler.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-961274" /><br/>
In fact, Apple is expected to move its entire Mac lineup to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/23/apple-testing-four-m4-macs/">M4 family of chips</a> over the next ~12 months, with several models expected to see <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/15/these-new-macs-are-coming-in-2024/">updates before the end of this year</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Five New Features in the iOS 18 Phone App</h2><br/>
iOS 18 will see its public release in just about a month, and we're continuing our series of articles looking at updates coming for individual apps.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/08/iOS-18-Phone-App-Feature-2.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-962140" /><br/>
<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ios-18-phone-app/">One of the apps seeing significant updates is the Phone app</a>, which will allow users to record and transcribe calls, with devices supporting Apple Intelligence also able to summarize transcriptions. You'll also be able to search your call history, see contact suggestions when you start typing numbers on the keypad, and more.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>First Plans for Apple's Tabletop Robot Spotted in Supply Chain</h2><br/>
We've been hearing for some time about Apple's work on a tabletop robot, and it <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/14/apple-tabletop-robotic-home-device-2026/">appears the project is moving forward</a> with a focus on smart home control, videoconferencing, and home security monitoring.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/08/Apple-Robot-Thumb-3.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-961757" /><br/>
Rumors have suggested the device could launch as soon as 2026, and we're already getting word about <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/19/apple-robot-spotted-in-supply-chain/">Apple's supply chain gearing up</a> to provide components for it.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[With <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a>, the Notes app is set to gain several new features. There aren't many updates to the overall design, but Notes has deeper integrations with other apps that add all kinds of new functionality. There are also a few nifty iPad-only Notes features that involve the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-pencil/">Apple Pencil</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/08/iOS-18-Notes-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-962295" /><br/>
<h2 id="math_notes">Math Notes</h2><br/>
Notes integrates with the Calculator app in &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj; for a new feature called Math Notes. Math Notes is designed to let you solve equations, so you can do things like add up your monthly budget, calculate what people owe for a group trip, or split a restaurant bill.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/ios-18-notes-app.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-957060" /><br/>
Math Notes works directly in the Notes app or in the Math Notes section of the Calculator app. Any equation that you type in is automatically solved when you add an equals sign, and there is support for variables.<br/>
<br/>
If you define several variables, you can then use those definitions in your calculations. If you write dinner = &#36;42, movies = &#36;24, and dessert = &#36;18 in the Notes app, you can then type in dinner + movies + dessert and add an equals sign to get the total. Variables can be used in equations and graphs (with a relevant equation) and adjusted later to change the results.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/ios-18-math-notes.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-960057" /><br/>
You can even do unit conversions with Math Notes. Just type in what you want to convert, and you'll get the result. If you type in 10 euros to pounds in a note and then add an equals sign, the Notes app will give you the answer.<br/>
<br/>
Apple says that Math Notes is able to solve all of the same functions as a scientific calculator.<br/>
<br/>
Math Notes is available for math written using Western Arabic numerals and common mathematical symbols, or typed using Arabic (Eastern & Western) and Devanagari numerals and common mathematical symbols.<br/>
<br/>
<h3 id="math_notes_in_ipados_18">Math Notes in iPadOS 18</h3><br/>
On the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>, you can use Math Notes with the &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj;. Just write out equations by hand and add an equals sign to have the Notes app solve them.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/ipados-18-math-notes.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-954476" /><br/>
All of the Math Notes features work with handwriting, including unit conversions.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="audio_recording_and_transcription">Audio Recording and Transcription</h2><br/>
The Notes app can be used to record any audio, taking advantage of the microphones in the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>. To record audio, tap on the paperclip icon in the toolbar and then tap on the "Record Audio" button.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/08/ios-18-notes-app-voice-recording.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-962314" /><br/>
From there, tap on the red record button to start a recording, and the stop button to end it. The option to record audio right in the Notes app is useful for lectures, meetings, and more.<br/>
<br/>
All recordings that you capture with the Notes app are automatically transcribed in real-time so you can read through what was recorded and even search for key phrases.<br/>
<br/>
Audio recording and transcribing is available on the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 12 and later, but the feature only works in English.<br/>
<br/>
<h3 id="phone_app_recording">Phone App Recording</h3><br/>
&zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj; <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ios-18-phone-app/">supports recording phone calls</a>, and when you initiate a recording of a phone call, that recording is stored in the Notes app. Phone app recordings have all of the same functionality as audio recordings made in the Notes app, with transcriptions provided.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/ios-18-1-call-recording-2.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1289" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-960200" /><br/>
<h3 id="transcription_summaries_apple_intelligence">Transcription Summaries (Apple Intelligence)</h3><br/>
Apple Intelligence can be used to summarize a transcript of an audio recording or a recorded phone call in the Notes app.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/08/ios-18-notes-transcript-summary.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-962315" /><br/>
A device that supports Apple Intelligence is required for this feature, and that includes the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a>/Pro Max and later as well as Macs and iPads with an M-series chip.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="collapsible_sections">Collapsible Sections</h2><br/>
If you have long notes with multiple headings, you can now collapse those headings down to create a more compact note.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/08/ios-18-notes-collapsible-headings.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1277" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-962316" /><br/>
Any section header can be collapsed, including headings, subheadings, and titles. Just tap on a heading and then tap on the down arrow to collapse it. Tap the arrow again to open it up.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="highlight_colors">Highlight Colors</h2><br/>
The Notes app supports colors for typed text for the first time, allowing for highlighting. Apple added five colors, including pink, purple, orange, mint, and blue, with the colors able to be added through the formatting interface. Just tap on the Aa button to get to the color options when a word or phrase is selected.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/iOS-18-Notes-Highlight-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-955031" /><br/>
Multiple colors can be used for the same sentence, and the colors can be used for titles and headings, as well as combined with text formatting like bold and italics.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="attach_files">Attach Files</h2><br/>
The toolbar icon that lets you add images or scanned documents to a note has been updated to do more in &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj;. Tapping on it allows you to attach a file from the Files app, which makes it much easier to add documents to a note. You can also use it to record audio, which is another new feature.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/08/ios-18-attach-file.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-962317" /><br/>
Before now, you had to copy and paste a file into notes to add it, a process that required several steps.<br/>
<br/>
The prior Choose Photo or Video, Scan Documents, Take Photo or Video, and Scan Text options remain. To denote the new functionality, the icon for the tool is now a paperclip instead of a camera.<br/>
<br/>
As an alternative to using the toolbar, you can long press on a note to attach a file, an option that wasn't previously available.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="notes_settings">Notes Settings</h2><br/>
If you tap on the icon that has three dots at the top right of a note, you can get to the Notes settings, where there are a number of new options.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/08/ios-18-notes-settings.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-962318" /><br/>
You can see Recent Notes from this interface, with the Notes app displaying several of your prior notes for quick access. There's also a toggle for Math Notes for choosing between suggested results and results that are automatically inserted when an equals sign is typed, or turning the feature off.<br/>
<br/>
Prior features for searching through the note, moving the note, adding lines and grids, and changing the attachment view are all still available.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="lock_screen_notes">Lock Screen Notes</h2><br/>
In &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj;, you can add Control Center controls to the Lock Screen. With this feature, you can add the option to open the Notes app into one of the slots that was previously taken up by the Flashlight and Camera, giving you an option for quickly jotting down your thoughts.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/08/ios-18-notes-lock-screen.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1251" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-962319" /><br/>
You could get to the Notes app from the Lock Screen previously, but it required going through Control Center.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="smart_script_ipados_18">Smart Script (iPadOS 18)</h2><br/>
On the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj;, there's a new feature called Smart Script that's designed to improve your handwriting with the &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj;. The feature uses machine learning to recreate your own handwriting style to refine what you've written, making messy writing look neater.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/ipados-18-smart-script.jpg" alt="" width="1900" height="1069" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-957164" /><br/>
Smart Script doesn't change your handwriting, but it makes it smoother, straighter, and easier to read.<br/>
<br/>
With Smart Script, you can also paste typed text into your own handwriting, correct handwritten spelling, touch and drag words to move them or change the spacing, and scribble out what you've written to erase it.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="writing_tools_apple_intelligence">Writing Tools (Apple Intelligence)</h2><br/>
Writing Tools is an Apple Intelligence feature that can improve your writing. It won't generate text from scratch for you, but it can proofread, help you rewrite to match a specific tone, and create summaries.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/ios-18-1-writing-tools.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-960221" /><br/>
<ul><br/>
 <li>Proofread text for spelling and grammar errors, including word choice and sentence structure. You can accept all suggestions with a tap or go through them one by one with explanations.</li><br/>
 <li>Rewrite for cleaning up what you've written and shifting the tone without impacting your content. Options include Friendly, Professional, and Concise.</li><br/>
 <li>Options for selecting text and summarizing it. You can choose to create a paragraph, pull out key points, make a list, or create a table. Summaries are available in Mail, Messages, and more.</li><br/>
</ul><br/>
To use Writing Tools in the Notes app, all you need to do is write something, select your text, and then tap on the quick access Writing Tools options at the top of the keyboard or select Writing Tools by tapping on your selected text.<br/>
<br/>
Writing Tools won't be available when &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj; and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-18/">iPadOS 18</a> launch, but the feature will be coming in iOS 18.1 and iPadOS 18.1 updates that we expect to see in October.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="image_wand_apple_intelligence">Image Wand (Apple Intelligence)</h2><br/>
The Notes app is designed to integrate with Image Playground, Apple's upcoming AI-powered image generation app. You will be able to have the Notes app create an image that goes along with what you've typed up, and on the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj;, you can make a rough sketch of what you want to include and then have Apple Intelligence generate a more polished version.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/08/apple-intelligence-image-wand.jpg" alt="" width="1640" height="995" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-962313" /><br/>
The feature that adds images into the Notes app is called Image Wand, and it's not yet clear when it will be implemented.<br/>
<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple has ramped up testing of four new Mac models equipped with an M4 chip, according to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-08-23/when-is-apple-announcing-the-iphone-16-apple-planning-event-on-sept-10-2024"><em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman</a>. Apple is planning to refresh the MacBook Pro, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-mini/">Mac mini</a>, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/">iMac</a> with M4 chips this year, and we could see the new models sometime in October.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/08/M4-Mac-mini-Black-Ortho-Cooler.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-961271" /><br/>
The four machines have base-level M4 chips, according to developer logs. Three of the Macs have a 10-core CPU and 10-core GPU. The fourth machine has an 8-core CPU and an 8-core GPU, which is not an M4 configuration that we've seen so far. All four of the M4 Macs have either 16GB or 32GB of Unified Memory.<br/>
<br/>
The M4 used in the 256GB and 512GB <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a> models has a 9-core CPU and 10-core GPU, while the chip used in the 1TB and 2TB models has a 10-core CPU and 10-core GPU. The high-end <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> chip is the same chip that will be in some of the Mac models.<br/>
<br/>
Gurman does not mention M4 Pro or M4 Max chips, which would be used in higher-end &zwnj;Mac mini&zwnj; and 14-inch MacBook Pro models, as well as the 16-inch MacBook Pro. M4 Pro and M4 Max chips would have a higher number of CPU and GPU cores, as well as more maximum memory.<br/>
<br/>
It is not clear if Apple is only introducing lower-end models with the standard M4 chip, or if there are plans for M4, M4 Pro, and M4 Max models but those higher-end chips simply weren't seen in the developer logs.<br/>
<br/>
Prior rumors have suggested that both the 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models would see a refresh, and Gurman previously said that the new, slimmer &zwnj;Mac mini&zwnj; that's in the works <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/08/mac-mini-to-become-smallest-ever-apple-computer/">will be available</a> with both M4 and M4 Pro chip options.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/">iMac</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro/">MacBook Pro 14 & 16" </a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-mini/">Mac mini</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iMac">iMac (Neutral)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Pro_16">14" & 16" MacBook Pro (Caution)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Mac_Mini">Mac Mini (Caution)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/imac.91">iMac</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macbook-pro.90">MacBook Pro</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/mac-mini.146">Mac mini</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/23/apple-testing-four-m4-macs/">Apple Testing Four New M4 Macs Ahead of Fall Launch</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-testing-four-new-m4-macs-ahead-of-fall-launch.2434245/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple plans to hold an event to introduce the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a> models, the next-generation Apple Watch models, and new AirPods on Tuesday, September 10, according to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-08-23/when-is-apple-announcing-the-iphone-16-apple-planning-event-on-sept-10-2024"><em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-935160" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/iPhone-16-Camera-Lozenge-2.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" /><br/>
After the September 10 unveiling, the devices will launch on Friday, September 20. With that timeline, we can expect new software like <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sequoia/">macOS Sequoia</a> to come out a few days ahead of the September 20 hardware launch.<br/>
<br/>
Apple has not yet officially announced the date for its September event, with Gurman instead citing sources familiar with Apple's plans. Apple is expected to send out media invites as soon as next week.<br/>
<br/>
The &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; models will include more powerful A18 chips that work with Apple Intelligence, and the entire &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; lineup is expected to support the new &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj; update. Apple plans to make the display of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/">iPhone 16 Pro</a> and Pro Max slightly bigger, and all four models will get a new Capture Button for taking photos.<br/>
<br/>
Standard &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; models will adopt the Action Button for the first time, and there is an improved Ultra Wide 48-megapixel camera coming to the &zwnj;iPhone 16 Pro&zwnj; lineup.<br/>
<br/>
As for the Apple Watch models, we are expecting an Apple Watch Series 10, a new version of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch-se/">Apple Watch SE</a>, and a refreshed Apple Watch Ultra. There are design changes in the works for the standard Apple Watch, with Apple set to introduce a thinner design and larger displays.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airpods-4/">AirPods 4</a> are coming as well, with Apple planning to debut two models for the first time. The lower-end model will be similar to the current AirPods, while the higher-end version will include Active Noise Cancellation.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Meta has canceled work on a high-end mixed reality headset that it was developing to compete with the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a>, reports <em><a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/meta-cancels-high-end-mixed-reality-headset">The Information</a></em>. Meta this week told employees to quit working on the device following a product review meeting that involved Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg.<br/>
<br/>

The now-canceled device was slated for launch in 2027, and it was meant to be equipped with high-resolution micro OLED displays, which is what Apple used for the Vision Pro. Meta was aiming to sell the device for under &#36;1,000, but that was not going to be possible with the high cost of the displays.<br/>
<br/>
Meta is continuing development on the Quest 4, a successor to the Quest 3, and that headset could come out in 2026. The Quest 3 is priced at &#36;500, which is also the likely target price point for its successor. Meta is also focusing on software rather than hardware, and it <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/22/meta-expands-vr-operating-system/">announced a Horizon OS platform</a> for third-party hardware makers earlier this year.<br/>
<br/>
When the Vision Pro launched, Meta was hoping that the device would <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/29/meta-optimistic-vision-pro-launch/">reinvigorate the headset market</a> and validate Zuckerberg's major push into the AR/VR space. Instead, Apple has struggled with consumer appeal, and interest in the Vision Pro has waned over time.<br/>
<br/>
Enthusiasm about the Vision Pro <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/22/apple-vision-pro-customer-interest-dying-down/">started dying down</a> just a month after it launched, and fewer customers visited Apple retail stores for demonstrations. Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/23/apple-cuts-vision-pro-shipments/">cut Vision Pro shipments</a> in April, and the company is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/11/apple-vision-pro-under-500000-sales-this-year/">unlikely to sell</a> even 500,000 of the headsets in 2024. As a result, Apple has stopped work on a second-generation high-cost Vision Pro and is instead focusing on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/18/apple-suspends-work-on-vision-pro-2/">creating a lower-cost model</a> with fewer features and a price closer to high-end iPhones.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/23/meta-cancels-high-end-headset/">Meta Cancels High-End Mixed Reality Headset After Apple Vision Pro Struggles</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/meta-cancels-high-end-mixed-reality-headset-after-apple-vision-pro-struggles.2434241/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[For this week's giveaway, we've <a href="https://southernstraps.com/">teamed up with Southern Straps</a> to offer <em>MacRumors</em> readers a chance to win an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch/">Apple Watch Series 9</a>. Southern Straps has been <a href="https://southernstraps.com/collections/nylon-bands-for-apple-watch">making high-quality bands</a> for the Apple Watch for almost a decade now, and the company's selection of bands offer a great alternative to Apple's own bands, in styles that Apple does not offer.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/southern-straps-nylon-band-3.jpg" alt="" width="3415" height="1921" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-915893" /><br/>
Southern Straps has a wide selection of nylon bands that pair a comfortable design with a classic watch band style. After the Apple Watch came out in 2015, Southern Straps was the first company to make nylon Apple Watch bands, and with so many years of experience, it has had time to perfect the band design and construction.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="https://southernstraps.com/collections/nylon-bands-for-apple-watch">Priced at &#36;29</a>, each Apple Watch band is made from a single piece of nylon that is doubled over, heat sealed, and stitched together for durability. The multi-step process makes sure that every band is going to hold up for multiple years to come, and there is a five-year warranty on bands.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/southern-straps-nylon-band-2.jpg" alt="" width="3381" height="1902" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-915892" /><br/>
There are 11 color options, ranging from solid colors in green, black, and sand, to striped options in aesthetic color combinations like blue and green, blue and orange, khaki and red, blue and white, black and gray, and the classic red, white, and blue.<br/>
<br/>
Bands can be ordered with custom hardware in black, silver, or gold to match different Apple Watch models. There are two sizes: one that is compatible with 42mm to 49mm Apple Watch models, and one that is compatible with smaller 38mm to 41mm models. The bands are compatible with every Apple Watch model from the original Apple Watch to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch-ultra/">Apple Watch Ultra 2</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/southern-straps-nylon-band-1.jpg" alt="" width="2823" height="1588" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-915891" /><br/>
Pegged spring bars are included with each band so that you're able to change the hardware if you get an Apple Watch in a new size or a new color. Southern Straps bands can be used on a daily basis for everything from work to working out.<br/>
<br/>
