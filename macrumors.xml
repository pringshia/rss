		<description><![CDATA[Meta, Microsoft, X, and Match today joined <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/epic-games/">Epic Games</a> to protest the way Apple complied with a court ruling requiring it to walk back its anti-steering rules. In an amicus brief in support of &zwnj;Epic Games&zwnj; (via <em><a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/apple-faces-legal-protest-from-meta-microsoft-x-and-match-7fe41d0f">The Wall Street Journal</a></em>), the four companies said that the fees Apple is charging are too high, and that there are too many restrictions on how developers link to their websites. "The Apple Plan comports with neither the letter nor the spirit of this Court's mandate," reads the brief.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-800065" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/05/app-store-blue-banner-epic-1.jpg" alt="" width="1794" height="1009" /><br/>
For context, Apple was ordered to change its <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a> rules in 2021 as part of the decision in the &zwnj;Epic Games&zwnj; case. The judge took issue with <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/10/epic-games-vs-apple-decision/">the anti-steering guidelines</a> that kept apps from directing consumers to lower prices available outside of the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj;. Apple delayed implementing the changes while it attempted to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/28/apple-epic-appeal-supreme-court/">appeal the ruling</a>, but <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/16/supreme-court-declines-to-hear-apple-vs-epic-case/">the appeal was not successful</a> and Apple had to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/16/us-app-store-alternative-purchase-option/">update its rules</a> in January.<br/>
<br/>
Developers are now allowed to include a single link in their app, with that link going to a website where customers can make a purchase without using the in-app purchase system. Apple is still collecting commission for purchases made this way, requiring developers to pay between 12 and 27 percent (three percent lower than the standard 15/30 fee).<br/>
<br/>
&zwnj;Epic Games&zwnj; <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/13/epic-games-apple-unjustified-fees/">last week told the court</a> that Apple has not complied with the order, and that the Cupertino company should be held in contempt of court. &zwnj;Epic Games&zwnj; said that Apple's implementation makes links "commercially unusable" due to the fee and the "accompanying web of restrictions."<br/>
<br/>
Microsoft, Meta, X, and Match further complained that Apple is not allowing apps to include "even the most basic information" about alternative purchase options. Apple does not allow apps to let customers know about how to receive a discount by purchasing directly from a website, for example.<br/>
<br/>
Meta said that it should be able to direct users to the web to pay for boosted posts to avoid Apple's fee, and Microsoft complained that Apple's rules limit options for providing subscriptions and discounts. X, formerly Twitter, said that Apple's 27 percent fee eliminates incentives to include an external link, while Match claimed that the rules prevent price competition for digital transactions.<br/>
<br/>
Apple in January claimed that it was in full compliance with the injunction, and that it has given developers a way to inform customers about alternative purchase mechanisms both in their apps and outside of their apps.<br/>
<br/>
The amicus brief filed today supports &zwnj;Epic Games&zwnj;' recent filing. &zwnj;Epic Games&zwnj; has asked the court to force Apple to bring its policies into compliance with the injunction, so it will be up to the court to decide whether Apple's rule change does enough to satisfy the requirements of the initial judgment.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/microsoft/">Microsoft</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/twitter/">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/epic-games/">Epic Games</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/epic-games-vs-apple/">Epic Games vs. Apple</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/meta/">Meta</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/20/microsoft-meta-app-store-fee-amicus-brief/">Meta, Microsoft, X and Match Join Epic Games in Protesting Fees for Non-App Store Purchase Links</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/meta-microsoft-x-and-match-join-epic-games-in-protesting-fees-for-non-app-store-purchase-links.2422385/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The next-generation iPad Pro models will feature thinner bezels around the screen compared to previous models, according to a rumor shared today by a previously-accurate <a href="https://weibo.com/5143897135/O5VxfdQGB">leaker known as "Instant Digital"</a> on Chinese social media platform Weibo.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/M3-iPad-Feature-3.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-917548" /><br/>
The leaker claimed that the next 11-inch and 12.9-inch iPad Pro models will have 7.12mm and 7.08mm bezels, respectively, when excluding the metal edges of the devices. If these measurements are accurate, the bezels would be around 10% to 15% thinner than on previous iPad Pro models released between 2018 and 2022.<br/>
<br/>
Other key new features rumored for the next iPad Pro models include Apple's latest M3 chip, a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/20/upcoming-oled-ipad-pro-thinner/">thinner enclosure</a>, a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/08/ipad-air-ipad-pro-landscape-facetime-camera/">landscape front camera</a>, rear camera design tweaks, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/18/ipad-pro-magsafe-charging/">potentially MagSafe wireless charging</a>. New accessories are also expected, including an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/03/gurman-new-ipad-magic-keyboard-to-feature-aluminum/">updated Magic Keyboard</a> with a partly-aluminum enclosure and an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/05/new-apple-pencil-to-launch-this-month/">updated Apple Pencil</a>.<br/>
<br/>
"Instant Digital" has a mostly-accurate track record with Apple rumors over the past year. The account was correct about <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/17/iphone-15-and-15-plus-frosted-glass-rumor/">frosted rear glass on the iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus</a>, the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/03/iphone-14-new-color-rumor/">yellow color option</a> for the iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus, and more, but it <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/10/ipad-air-6-rumored-to-launch-in-october/">incorrectly said</a> the iPad Air would receive a hardware update last year.<br/>
<br/>
The new iPad Pro models should be announced <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/18/new-ipads-likely-to-begin-shipping-in-april/">in late March or early April</a>, according to Ross Young, CEO of Display Supply Chain Consultants. <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/18/new-ipads-march-26-launch-date-rumor/">Tuesday, March 26</a> has been specifically rumored as a potential iPad Pro announcement date.<br/>
<br/>
Apple is also expected to update the 10.9-inch iPad Air, and release an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/10/12-9-inch-ipad-air-display-shipments/">all-new 12.9-inch iPad Air</a>.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/instant-digital/">Instant Digital</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#11-iPad-Pro">11" iPad Pro (Don't Buy)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#12-9-iPad-Pro">12.9" iPad Pro (Don't Buy)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipad.137">iPad</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/20/new-ipad-pro-models-thinner-bezels-rumor/">New iPad Pro Rumored to Feature Thinner Bezels Than Previous Models</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/new-ipad-pro-rumored-to-feature-thinner-bezels-than-previous-models.2422383/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's marketing chief Greg Joswiak, vice president of iPhone marketing Kaiann Drance, and a few other senior employees at the company recently participated in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LyW9gVstuE">ride-along interview</a> with YouTube video creator Brian Tong.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/Apple-Park-Brian-Tong.jpg" alt="" width="1916" height="1076" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-942319" /><em>Greg Joswiak talks with Brian Tong in a golf cart ride at Apple Park</em></div><br/>
The interview took place in a golf cart driving around Apple Park, with various employees hopping in and out to talk with Tong along the way.<br/>
<br/>
The video provides an update on the "state of the iPhone," with Joswiak and others discussing the device's past, present, and future. Apple also once again <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/01/apple-ai-details-coming-later-this-year/">hinted at AI-related announcements later this year</a>, with the company widely expected to announce <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/16/ios-18-slew-of-new-ai-features/">iOS 18 with new generative AI features</a> at Apple's developers conference WWDC in June.<br/>
<br/>
The video is worth a watch if you are an iPhone enthusiast, or if you simply want to see Joswiak pretend to get hit by a golf cart.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple recently added a <a href="https://support.apple.com/docs">new "Documentation" page</a> to its website that provides links to user guides, repair manuals, tech specs, software downloads, and more for a variety of products. Some of this information was previously found across separate pages on Apple's website, and it has now been combined in one place for convenient access.<br/>
<br/>

The page includes categories for the Mac, iPhone, iPad, iPod, Vision Pro, Apple Watch, Apple TV, AirPods, HomePod, displays like the Studio Display and Pro Display XDR, accessories like the Apple Pencil and Magic Keyboard, and software.<br/>

There is also a search tool on the page that provides links to support documents and other relevant information based on the keywords entered.<br/>

Cook's visit is timed with the upcoming grand opening of Apple's new Jing'an store in Shanghai on Thursday, March 21 at 7 p.m. local time.<br/>
<br/>
Apple provided more details about the store <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2024/03/apple-jingan-to-welcome-its-first-customers-thursday-march-21-in-shanghai/">in a recent press release</a>.<br/>

"Located next to the landmark Jing'an Temple, Apple Jing'an is a must-see destination in Shanghai," said Apple. "Approaching the store through a grove of maple trees that line the upper plaza, visitors are treated to a stunning view of the temple. As customers descend down the stairs, they pass by terracing, double-curved walls that extend forward in a circle to form amphitheater seating that will host Today at Apple sessions specially created for Apple Jing'an to celebrate the community and its creators."<br/>
<br/>
A custom wallpaper with a flower-like Apple logo is available for download for the iPhone, iPad, and Mac <a href="https://www.apple.com.cn/retail/jingan/">on the store's page</a>.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's next-generation <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a> models will be offered with a matte display option for the first time, according to the Weibo leaker known as "<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/instant-digital/">Instant Digital</a>."<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/iPad-Pro-Matte-Display-Feature-1.6.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-942196" /><br/>
The Weibo user explained that the &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj;'s new matte display option will be offered in addition to the standard, glossy glass finish. It apparently features -4° to +29° of haze and may tout some kind of blue-light blocking technology to help protect the eyes. Matte screen protectors for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> have become popular, so it is possible that Apple is trying to offer such an option at the point of purchase for those who want it.<br/>
<br/>
It is not known if the matte display option will be "nano-texture" glass like on the Pro Display XDR and Studio Display, but it seems plausible. Nano-texture glass is effectively a matte finish that scatters light to minimize glare, which is ideal in environments with bright light sources. While matte screen coatings effectively reduce reflections, they also make the image slightly more dull and hazy. Nano-texture glass features an etched surface to help preserve image quality.<br/>
<br/>
Nano-texture glass has only been offered on desktop displays so far. It is harder to clean owing to its textured surface that grips oil and debris more tightly, and Apple cautions that it should only be cleaned with a polishing cloth made with soft, non-abrasive material. It is not clear how a matte display on the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; would hold up to fingerprints as a result. <br/>
<br/>
The matte display option may also be available on the next-generation <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/">iPad Air</a> models, but the leaker could not confirm if this will be the case. They added that new &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; models will be <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/18/new-ipads-march-26-launch-date-rumor/">announced next week</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Earlier this week, Instant Digital said that the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> 17 <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/19/iphone-17-anti-reflective-display/">will feature an anti-reflective display</a> that is more scratch-resistant than Apple's Ceramic Shield found on recent models. It is not apparent if this technology is related to the new matte display option for the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj;, but it is a possibility.<br/>
<br/>
Instant Digital has a mixed track record in terms of revealing accurate information about Apple's plans, but their claims are worth paying attention to. The source was <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/03/iphone-14-new-color-rumor/">first to report</a> the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-14/">iPhone 14</a>'s Yellow spring refresh in 2023, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/04/future-iphone-could-capture-spatial-photos-videos/">Spatial Video</a> capture on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a>, and the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch/">Apple Watch Series 9</a>'s <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/04/apple-watch-series-9-basically-unchanged/">minor hardware update</a>, as well as being the only source of the only rumor claiming that the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a> and &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; Plus would feature <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/17/iphone-15-and-15-plus-frosted-glass-rumor/">frosted back glass</a>.

		<description><![CDATA[Key parts of Apple's compliance with the Digital Markets Act (DMA) are set to be investigated by European regulators based on developer feedback, the EU's antitrust chief warned on Tuesday.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/App-Store-vs-EU-Feature-2.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-932826" /><br/>
In an interview with <em><a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/eus-vestager-warns-about-apple-meta-fees-disparaging-rival-products-2024-03-19/">Reuters</a></em>, the European Commission's Executive Vice-President Margrethe Vestager said that Apple's introduction of new fees was already being looked at as a potential attempt to dissuade developers from using alternative app stores.<br/>
<blockquote>"There are things that we take a keen interest in, for instance, if the new Apple fee structure will de facto not make it in any way attractive to use the benefits of the DMA. That kind of thing is what we will be investigating," she told Reuters.</blockquote>Apple enabled alternative app stores in the EU <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/19/iphone-changes-coming-to-eu-users/">earlier this month</a>, allowing third-party app stores to offer a catalog of other developers' apps as well as the marketplace developer's own apps. Apple also has a new fee structure as part of the change that has already come under fire from <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/01/spotify-epic-games-apple-dma-complaint/">several developers and EU associations</a>. <br/>
<br/>
In addition, Vestager warned Apple and other companies against discouraging users from switching to other app marketplaces by disparaging them, saying this kind of behaviour could trigger an investigation. Apple has already claimed some of the DMA-enforced changes could <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/01/apple-whitepaper-alternative-app-marketplaces/">expose users to security risks</a> that they are otherwise protected against when using the App Store.<br/>
<blockquote>"I would think of it as unwise to say that the services are not safe to use, because that has nothing to do with the DMA," said Vestager. "The DMA is there to open the market for other service providers to get to you and how your service provider of your operating system, how they will make sure that it is safe is for them to decide."<br/>
<br/>
"And of course, if we see or get the suspicion that this is in order to say that someone else are not doing their job of course, we might take initiatives to look into that," she added.</blockquote>Vestager said feedback from developers was key to whether she would launch investigations into companies that must comply with the DMA. Asked whether she had received any comments from third parties, she replied: "Quite a lot."<br/>
<br/>
Apple's app ecosystem changes in the European Union went into effect with the launch of iOS 17.4 on March 6. Apple has since been tweaking the app ecosystem rules that it introduced based on developer feedback and discussions with EU regulators. <br/>
<br/>
For example, third-party app stores are now able to offer apps <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/12/apple-announces-app-downloads-from-websites/">directly from their own catalog</a>, and developers will soon be able to distribute apps directly from their websites as long as they meet Apple's requirements. <br/>
<br/>
Apple says it is also working out a solution that would prevent its 0.50 euro <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/25/apple-eu-fees-could-bankrupt-app-developers/">Core Technology Fee (CTF)</a> from bankrupting developers if their free app goes viral.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/european-union/">European Union</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/european-commission/">European Commission</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/antitrust/">Apple Antitrust</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/20/eu-antitrust-chief-warns-apple-app-store-fees/">EU Antitrust Chief Warns Apple About App Store Fees and Safety Warnings</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/eu-antitrust-chief-warns-apple-about-app-store-fees-and-safety-warnings.2422345/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<title>iPhone 16 to Adopt Ultra-Thin Bezel Technology to Maximize Display</title>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple plans to maximize the display size on the upcoming iPhone 16 series by using a new ultra-thin bezel technology, claims a new report out of Korea. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/12/iPhone-16-Pro-Sizes-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-927877" /><br/>
According to <em><a href="https://www.sisajournal-e.com/news/articleView.html?idxno=401354">Sisa Journal</a></em>, Apple will use Border Reduction Structure (BRS) technology to minimize the bezel at the bottom of the display. BRS achieves this by rolling up the internal copper wiring into a more compact package.<br/>
<br/>
Apple reportedly plans to apply the borderless display technology to all four iPhone 16 models, which are due to be released in the second half of this year.<br/>
<br/>
The company is said to have attempted to apply the technology to iPhones before, but previous attempts were curtailed due to heat issues. Apple's reinvigorated efforts to adopt BRS are reportedly due to recent improvements in heat dissipation technology.<br/>
<br/>
Last year, Apple reduced the bezels on iPhone 15 Pro models using low-injection pressure over-molding, or LIPO, to shrink the display border size to 1.5 millimeters (versus around 2.2 millimeters on iPhone 14 models).<br/>
<br/>
Besides that, Apple has not significantly tweaked iPhone screen sizes since the introduction of the ‌‌iPhone‌‌ 12 models in 2020. However, that's set to change with the 2024 iPhone 16 lineup. The iPhone 16 Pro models will have notably larger display sizes than the current iPhone 15 Pro models. <br/>
<br/>
According to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/29/iphone-16-preliminary-weights-dimensions/">multiple sources</a>, the ‌‌iPhone 16 Pro‌‌ and ‌‌iPhone 16 Pro‌‌ Max will feature an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/16/iphone-16-display-sizes/">increase in display size</a> compared to the ‌iPhone 15 Pro‌ and ‌‌iPhone 15 Pro‌‌ Max. The ‌‌iPhone 16 Pro‌‌ will reportedly have a 6.27-inch display (159.31 mm), while the ‌‌iPhone 16 Pro‌‌ Max will feature a 6.85-inch (174.06 mm) screen, with Apple likely marketing the sizes as 6.3 inches and 6.9 inches, respectively.<br/>
<br/>
With the increase in display size, the dimensions of the ‌iPhone‌'s body will also increase. The ‌‌iPhone 16 Pro‌‌ and 16 Pro Max will be slightly taller than their predecessors, while also being somewhat wider. The larger form factor of the devices will give Apple more internal space for components. The ‌iPhone 16 Pro‌ models could get larger, longer-lasting batteries for example.<br/>

We are not expecting size changes for the ‌iPhone 16‌ and ‌iPhone 16‌ Plus, and these devices will be the same size as the iPhone 15 and ‌iPhone 15‌ Plus. However, with the ‌‌iPhone‌‌ 17 and ‌‌iPhone‌‌ 17 Plus in 2025, Apple is expected to also bring the larger 6.27- and 6.86-inch display sizes to its two standard ‌‌iPhone‌‌ models.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/">iPhone 16 Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/20/iphone-16-ultra-thin-bezels-rumor/">iPhone 16 to Adopt Ultra-Thin Bezel Technology to Maximize Display</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-16-to-adopt-ultra-thin-bezel-technology-to-maximize-display.2422342/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today began rolling out a firmware update for its <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airtags/">AirTag</a> item trackers. The firmware features a build number of 2A73 (2.0.73), up from <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/31/airtags-firmware-update/">the 2A61 firmware</a> that came out last October.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-813264" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/08/AitTag-New-Firmware.jpg" alt="" width="2390" height="1344" /><br/>
Apple does share <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/102183">release notes</a> for &zwnj;AirTag&zwnj; firmware updates, but the document has yet to be updated for the new release so there's no word yet on what might be included in the update.<br/>
<br/>
As is typical for &zwnj;AirTag&zwnj; updates, today's firmware release will be rolling out on a staggered basis. One percent of users will get the update today, and then it will expand to 10 percent of users on March 26. On April 2, the update will expand to 25 percent of users, and then it will be available to all on April 9.<br/>
<br/>
It is not possible to force an &zwnj;AirTag&zwnj; update, as it's something that's done over-the-air through a connected <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>. To make sure the update happens, you can put your &zwnj;AirTag&zwnj; in range of your ‌&zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;‌, but you have to wait for the firmware to roll out to your device.

		<description><![CDATA[Back at CES in January, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/09/ces-2024-alogic-charger-displays/">Alogic introduced</a> its new lineup of 32-inch 4K displays, following up on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/review/alogic-clarity-pro-touch-displays/">27-inch models</a> launched last year. I've now had some time to put the high-end <a href="https://alogic.co/products/clarity-max-touch-32-uhd-4k-monitor-with-usb-c-power-delivery-webcam-and-touch-screen/?ref=y2uwzwu">Clarity Max Touch model</a> from the 32-inch family through my daily grind, and I've found it offers some nice features for those looking for a larger canvas to work on.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/alogic-clarity-max-touch-triple-setup.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-942128" /><br/>
To recap, there are three models in each of the 27-inch and 32-inch Clarity display lineups, with varying features. The <a href="https://alogic.co/products/clarity-max-32-uhd-4k-monitor-with-usb-c-power-delivery/?ref=y2uwzwu">base model</a> in each is a fairly standard 4K display running at up to 60 Hz that can connect over USB-C, HDMI, or DisplayPort, and it includes a few extra USB-A ports on the rear to serve as a mini-hub for accessories that don't demand too much in the way of power or data speeds.<br/>
<br/>
The <a href="https://alogic.co/products/clarity-max-pro-32-uhd-4k-monitor-with-usb-c-power-delivery-and-webcam/?ref=y2uwzwu">middle-tier model</a> of each size adds a retractable 8-megapixel webcam at the top of the display, while the <a href="https://alogic.co/products/clarity-max-touch-32-uhd-4k-monitor-with-usb-c-power-delivery-webcam-and-touch-screen/?ref=y2uwzwu">high-end models</a> offer both the webcam and touchscreen support that works on Windows and Mac. For the 32-inch family, I've only tested the high-end Clarity Max Touch, but my observations should also apply to both the base Clarity Max and the mid-range Clarity Max Pro with the exception of those features that are exclusive to models at the higher end of the range.<br/>
<br/>
Setup is quite easy, with a two-piece stand design that quickly goes together with a thumb screw and then clicks into the rear of the display. The stand is primarily made of silver aluminum, which offers sturdy support for the display with very little wobble. The stand offers both tilt and height adjustment, a welcome feature that costs extra on some displays such as the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/studio-display/">Apple Studio Display</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/alogic-clarity-max-touch-ports.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="860" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-942129" /><em>Rear ports</em></div><br/>
With USB-C, HDMI, and DisplayPort connectivity options, you have an array of choices depending on your setup and you can connect additional devices like an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a> or game console thanks to the multiple inputs.<br/>
<br/>
I hooked the Clarity Max Touch up to my 16-inch MacBook Pro with <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m1-pro/">M1 Pro</a> chip and generally used it in a triple-display setup with the Alogic display as my main monitor, a 27-inch LG 5K UltraFine display off to the left as a secondary display, and the MacBook Pro with its built-in display off to the right as a third screen. I tested with both HDMI and USB-C connections and settled on USB-C for the more seamless operation it offered.<br/>
<br/>
My typical desk setup has included a pair of the 5K UltraFine displays, so I've been a bit spoiled by the high pixel density that allows for true Retina quality plus the tight integration with macOS such as support for volume and brightness adjustment right from my Magic Keyboard.<br/>
<br/>
With a lower 4K resolution on a larger 32-inch screen, running the Clarity Max Touch at a Retina size of 1920x1080 isn't a feasible option, as content appears far too large on the screen, which means you're going to want to run it at a higher scaled resolution. I used the 3360x1890 option in macOS for a while but ultimately settled on the maximum 3840x2160 resolution. Content is a bit on the small side, but the benefits of having a huge 4K desktop make it worth it for me.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/alogic-clarity-max-touch-solo.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="1332" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-942133" /><br/>
Content certainly is not as sharp as on a Retina display, but when I run it as a full 4K desktop, the content is small enough on the screen that it's not a major hindrance in my opinion. I'm not a high-level photo or video editor, so I'm not heavy into display calibration, but with testing only a few color profiles I was able to find one I was happy with. Depending on color profile, the display can pick up a bit of a pink tint as you move to more severe viewing angles, but as long as I was looking fairly straight-on as I normally would, I didn't notice any color issues.<br/>
<br/>
It's worth noting that the Clarity Max lineup is one of the only display families I'm aware of to offer 32-inch glossy screens as opposed to the matte finishes more commonly found on this size of display. I've found the glossy screen on the Clarity Max Touch allows for good color reproduction, and while it can generate some glare depending on lighting angles, I already have a good desk arrangement that minimizes the issue so it hasn't affected my use of the display.<br/>
<br/>
The display does run at a maximum of only 60 Hz, so if you're looking for higher refresh rates, you won't find them here. But for my day-to-day usage that centers around web browsing and other productivity tasks, it's perfectly fine. If you like portrait displays, the Clarity Max models easily rotate to vertical orientation and macOS makes it easy to adjust desktop rotation to match.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/alogic-clarity-max-touch-portrait.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="1095" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-942134" /><br/>
If you connect any of the Clarity Max displays to your laptop via USB-C, the display can provide up to 65 watts of passthrough power to keep your computer charged up. That's enough for most of Apple's laptops, although 16-inch MacBook Pro models and higher-end 14-inch models may be able to exceed that limit. But unless you're doing really heavy work, the display's power output should be sufficient for most users, even if it may not be able to recharge a depleted battery as quickly as a more powerful charger.<br/>
<br/>
The 8-megapixel retractable webcam remains hidden within the body of the display while not in use, and it automatically rises whenever an app such as <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/facetime/">FaceTime</a>, Skype, or Zoom is opened and the display's webcam is selected in the app's settings. The camera automatically retracts when the app is closed or a different camera is selected in the app's settings.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/alogic-clarity-max-touch-camera.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="710" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-942130" /><em>Camera activated</em></div><br/>
My test unit did ship with a bug that prevented the webcam from retracting once the app requiring it was closed, but a simple firmware update fixed the issue for me and Alogic says units shipping now should come with that firmware pre-installed.<br/>
<br/>
I found the camera quality to be solid, and even a step up from most integrated cameras I've seen in other displays, although it won't be able to match the quality when using an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> via Continuity Camera or other higher-end standalone options. While the built-in camera does have some limitations for adjusting the field of view, there is a manual wheel on the rear of the camera housing that allows you to vertically adjust the angle of the camera within the housing to optimize it for your sitting position.<br/>
<br/>
It's worth noting that a motorized retractable webcam is a feature that introduces another place for potential failure in the device, but for privacy-minded folks, it's a nice feature that guarantees the camera can't be remotely activated without your knowledge.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/alogic-clarity-max-touch-retracted.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="671" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-942131" /><em>Camera retracted</em></div><br/>
Power, volume, and on-screen display settings are controlled by a set of buttons on the bottom right edge of the display. It makes for a clean design, although it takes some time to get used to their location and which button does what. The five buttons all feel quite similar to the touch, so you need to make sure you're hitting the right ones as you reach under the display.<br/>
<br/>
Turning to the touchscreen functionality available only on the top-end Clarity Max Touch model, it's essentially identical to the functionality I described in my review of the 27-inch model. It requires installation of several drivers and apps to control the Mac functionality, and while the apps do not offer a native macOS feel, they do support an impressive array of customizability options for the touchscreen feature. <br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/alogic-updd-touch-gestures.jpg" alt="" width="1189" height="692" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-942136" /><em>Touch gesture setup</em></div><br/>
The UPDD Commander app lets you customize various touch options for defaults as well as on a per-app basis, with features like one-finger tap, press, drag, and edge swipe, two-finger tap, drag, pinch, rotate, edge swipe, three-finger tap and swipes, and five-finger pinch expand gestures all supported. The array of gestures can make for an iPad-like experience on a large display in front of you, but my arm does quickly tire if I try to do more than short bursts of touch activity. Some users may also be reluctant to get fingerprints and other smudges on their glossy display, although that wasn't an issue for me with my occasional touchscreen usage and my lighting angles.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/alogic-updd-touch-gestures-options-zoom.jpg" alt="" width="895" height="573" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-942157" /><em>Touch gesture options</em></div><br/>
Beyond the basic gesture configuration, you can also tweak an array of other settings such as the time limit for a double tap interval, the minimum time for a press gesture versus a tap gesture, the radius around your touch point that the system will look for a clickable UI element, and more.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/alogic-updd-touch-settings.jpg" alt="" width="1189" height="692" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-942138" /><em>Additional touch settings</em></div><br/>
If you need precise control such as for drawing apps, you can use a non-capacitive active stylus (an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-pencil/">Apple Pencil</a> won't work), and for those looking for an ergonomic display stand to bring the Clarity Max Touch into a better orientation for drawing, Alogic offers a <a href="https://alogic.co/products/clarity-fold-stand-for-clarity-pro-touch/?ref=y2uwzwu">Clarity Fold Stand</a> sold separately for &#36;200.<br/>
<br/>
The touchscreen functionality doesn't turn my Mac into a full touch experience, but I do sometimes find it convenient to just flick the screen to scroll long web pages, use a three-finger swipe to access Mission Control, or use the five-finger pinch expand gesture to get to my desktop. Pinch and rotation gestures are also helpful with some image manipulation tasks.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Wrap-up</h2><br/>
The base <a href="https://alogic.co/products/clarity-max-32-uhd-4k-monitor-with-usb-c-power-delivery/?ref=y2uwzwu">Clarity Max</a> model is priced at &#36;999.99, while the <a href="https://alogic.co/products/clarity-max-pro-32-uhd-4k-monitor-with-usb-c-power-delivery-and-webcam/?ref=y2uwzwu">Clarity Max Pro with retractable webcam</a> is priced at &#36;1,199.99 and the top-of-the-line <a href="https://alogic.co/products/clarity-max-touch-32-uhd-4k-monitor-with-usb-c-power-delivery-webcam-and-touch-screen/?ref=y2uwzwu">Clarity Max Touch with webcam and touchscreen capabilities</a> is priced at &#36;1,399.99, but Alogic's sale currently knocks 20% off of those prices with coupon code ALG20.<br/>
<br/>
Overall, I've found the 32-inch Clarity Max Touch to be a solid display if your setup and workflows are compatible with a larger 4K display. The high-end model is on the pricier side of things, but it does come with some extras with the motorized retractable webcam and the touchscreen capabilities and the current sale brings the pricing down quite a bit. And if you don't need one or both of those features, you can step down to one of the cheaper models.<br/>
<br/>
With any of the three models, you get a large desktop canvas on a glossy display, quality construction, a clean design, good connectivity options, and the flexibility of tilt and height adjustments including the ability to swivel the display to a portrait orientation. I do miss the Retina sharpness of my 27-inch 5K LG UltraFine display and the tight macOS integration it offers, but the LG is one of only a few options to offer those features and not at a 32-inch size. <br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's previous generation 24-inch M1 iMacs have received <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0932G65T7%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1">steep discounts</a> this week on Amazon, including up to &#36;651 off select models. These deals are being offered by Expercom via their Amazon storefront.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/02/iMac-Deals-Blue.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1407" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-837855" /><em><small>Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with Amazon. When you click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment, which helps us keep the site running.</small></em><br/>
<br/>
Starting with the 8-Core GPU/256GB M1 iMac, Amazon has this model for <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0932G65T7%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1"><strong>&#36;898.98</strong></a> in Blue, which is down from the original price of &#36;1,499.00. This is a new all-time low price on the M1 iMac.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0932G65T7%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1"target="_blank"><div class="fancybutton"><div class="fancybadge">&#36;601 OFF</div>M1 iMac (256GB) for &#36;898.98</div></a></div><br/>

Amazon also has the 8-Core GPU/512GB M1 iMac on sale for <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0931VVFG5%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"><strong>&#36;1,048.97</strong></a>, down from &#36;1,699.00.

Apple's M1 iMac is about three years old at this point, and it was replaced with the 24-inch M3 iMac late last year. Despite its age, this is still an Apple silicon-based machine with plenty of internal power to support your average day-to-day usage and some more basic workflows.<br/>

		<title>Apple Preparing to Sell Refurbished Ultra 2 and Series 9 Watches in U.S.</title>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple appears to be gearing up to sell refurbished Apple Watch Ultra 2 and Apple Watch Series 9 models on its online store in the U.S. for the first time.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/Apple-Watch-Ultra-2-hero-feature-white.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-911671" /><br/>
Apple recently added grayed-out search filters for the Ultra 2 and Series 9 to its desktop <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/refurbished/watch">refurbished website in the U.S.</a>, suggesting that it plans to sell refurbished models of those devices at some point. It is unclear exactly when availability will begin, but this is a routine step that Apple takes shortly before selling new refurbished models.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/Refurbished-Ultra-2-and-Series-9.jpg" alt="" width="374" height="189" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-942161" /><div class="center-wrap"><em>The refurbished Ultra 2 and Series 9 search filters (since removed)</em></div><br/>
Like new Ultra 2 and Series 9 models sold directly by Apple in the U.S. currently, it is expected that the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/18/apple-website-apple-watch-blood-oxygen-removal/">Blood Oxygen app would be deactivated</a> on the refurbished models, due to a legal battle with medical technology company Masimo. Last year, the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/10/itc-opposes-apple-watch-sales-ban-pause/">banned Apple</a> from importing and selling Apple Watch models with blood oxygen sensing after it ruled that the feature infringed on Masimo's patents.<br/>
<br/>
Apple stopped selling refurbished Apple Watch Series 7 and Series 8 models in the U.S. after the ban took effect, as those also offer the Blood Oxygen app.<br/>
<br/>
It is also possible that Apple and Masimo could reach a settlement before Apple starts selling refurbished Ultra 2 and Series 9 models, allowing for the Blood Oxygen app to be activated on the devices. If not, the feature could still be <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/12/apple-watch-blood-oxygen-sensor-software/">re-enabled with a watchOS software update in the future</a>, if and when the legal battle is resolved.<br/>
<br/>
On a related note, the first-generation Apple Watch Ultra has never been offered on Apple's refurbished store in the U.S., but it is <a href="https://www.apple.com/uk/shop/refurbished/watch/apple-watch-ultra">available in the U.K.</a>, <a href="https://www.apple.com/ie/shop/refurbished/watch/apple-watch-ultra">Ireland</a>, <a href="https://www.apple.com/cn/shop/refurbished/watch/apple-watch-ultra">China</a>, and <a href="https://www.apple.com/jp/shop/refurbished/watch/apple-watch-ultra">Japan</a>. Since the ITC's ruling applies to the U.S. only, the Blood Oxygen app is still functional on Apple Watch models sold in all other countries.<br/>
<br/>
U.S. customers who want an Ultra 2 or Series 9 with the Blood Oxygen app activated can still <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/19/apple-watch-9-low-prices/">purchase one from Best Buy for now</a>. <br/>
<br/>
<em>Thanks, Stewart Dunford!</em><br/>

		<description><![CDATA[The next-generation <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/">iPad Air</a> is now reportedly shipping to the United States and other countries in preparation for launch.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/iPad-Air-5.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="675" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-938463" /><br/>
The rumor comes from the leaker known as "<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/instant-digital/">Instant Digital</a>," who claims that manufacturers in China are now shipping the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/2024-ipad-air/">2024 iPad Air</a> in two sizes to overseas locations. "Everything is ready" for launch, the Weibo user says.<br/>
<br/>
The sixth-generation &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; is rumored to feature the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m2/">M2</a> chip, a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/20/next-gen-ipad-air-with-12-9-inch-display-and-redesigned-camera-unit-revealed-in-cad-renders/">redesigned rear camera</a>, and specification upgrades like Bluetooth 5.3 and Wi-Fi 6E. Most significantly, the &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; is expected to come in two sizes for the first time, just like the Apple Watch, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/">MacBook Air</a>, and MacBook Pro. One of the size options will be the same as the previous two generations at 10.9-inches, while the new addition to the lineup will apparently mirror the &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj;'s 12.9-inch model.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/18/new-ipads-march-26-launch-date-rumor/">Recent reports</a> coming out of Asia suggest that Apple will announce new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> models on Tuesday, March 26. According to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/11/new-ipads-end-of-march-or-april-gurman/"><em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman</a>, Apple plans to release new &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; models around the end of March or in April.

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's latest<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/07/apple-releases-macos-sonoma-14-4/"> macOS Sonoma 14.4 software update</a> appears to be guilty of another bug, this time affecting saved versions in iCloud Drive.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/01/iCloud-Bug-Feature-Green.jpg" alt="" width="2250" height="1266" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-834609" /><br/>
Versions are normally created automatically when users save files using apps that work with the version system in macOS. (To check if your Mac is using the <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/mac-help/mh40710/mac">past versions system</a>, look for a "Revert To" option in the app's File menu.)<br/>
<br/>
According to <a href="https://eclecticlight.co/2024/03/18/serious-bug-in-sonoma-14-4-will-destroy-saved-versions-in-icloud-drive/"><em>The Eclectic Light Company</em>'s Howard Oakley</a>, users running macOS 14.4 that have "Optimize Mac Storage" enabled should be aware that they are at risk of losing all previously saved versions of a file if they opt to remove it from iCloud Drive local storage. <br/>
<blockquote>In previous versions of macOS, when a file is evicted from local storage in iCloud Drive [using the Remove Download option in the right-click contextual menu], all its saved versions have been preserved. Download that file again from iCloud Drive, and versions saved on that Mac (but not other Macs or devices) have remained fully accessible. Do that in 14.4, and all previous versions are now removed, and lost forever.</blockquote>Oakley said his own tests confirmed that this behavior does not happen in macOS Sonoma 14.3 or macOS Ventura, so it is exclusive to macOS 14.4. For users who have already updated, he suggests either not saving files to iCloud Drive at all, or turning off Optimize Mac Storage. <br/>
<br/>
To perform the latter in System Settings, click your Apple ID, select iCloud, and then toggle off the switch next to "Optimize Mac Storage." You may need to perform this action twice – reports suggest it can turn back on by itself. For a more exhaustive account of the problem, see Oakley's <a href="https://eclecticlight.co/2024/03/19/sonomas-lost-versions-bug-what-it-is-and-how-to-safeguard-versions/">subsequent post</a>.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Next year's iPhone 17 will feature an anti-reflective display that is more scratch-resistant than Apple's Ceramic Shield found on iPhone 15 models, according to a new rumor out of Asia.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/iphone-15-galaxy-s24-ultra-corning-glass.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-941959" /><div class="center-wrap"><em>Anti-reflection properties of Galaxy S24 Ultra (bottom) vs. iPhone 15 (Image: <a href="https://x.com/UniverseIce/status/1749261102310199416?s=20">IceUniverse</a>)</em></div><br/>
Chinese Weibo leaker <a href="https://weibo.com/n/刹那数码">Instant Digital</a> claimed on Tuesday that the outer glass on the iPhone 17 is set to have a "super-hard anti-reflective layer" that is "more scratch-resistant than you think." The coating equipment has just been handed over to China's supply chain, according to the leaker, but not in time for it to feature in this year's upcoming iPhone 16 series.<br/>
<br/>
"Ceramic Shield" is a marketing name for a glass-ceramic material developed by Corning in collaboration with Apple. Apple says the Ceramic Shield on the iPhone 15 is "tougher than any smartphone glass." Introduced on iPhone 12 models in 2020, Apple advertised the ceramic-infused glass as increasing drop performance by 4x compared to the iPhone 11.<br/>
<br/>
More recently, Samsung debuted its newest Galaxy S24 Ultra, which features a Gorilla Glass Armor display panel, also developed by Corning. <a href="https://www.corning.com/gorillaglass/worldwide/en/corning-gorilla-armor.html">According to Corning</a>, the Armor panel cuts reflections by 75 percent compared to a typical glass surface, and is resistant to micro scratches that build up over time on competing glass panels. Corning also claims the panels offer over 4x more scratch resistance than competitive aluminosilicate cover glasses.<br/>
<br/>
It's not clear whether Apple is planning to adopt Gorilla Glass Armor for the iPhone 17, but the description matches the Chinese leaker's claims. Corning could also be supplying Apple with an equivalent technology that will be branded under another name. <br/>

Corning has been a longtime Apple supplier, with Gorilla Glass used in devices across Apple's product lineup. In <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/05/10/apple-awards-corning-45m-manufacturing-fund/">2021</a>, Apple said it had invested a combined &#36;495 million to support Corning's ongoing research and development into "state-of-the-art glass processes," which led to the creation of Ceramic Shield.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/corning/">Corning</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/instant-digital/">Instant Digital</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/19/iphone-17-anti-reflective-display/">iPhone 17 to Feature New Scratch Resistant Anti-Reflective Display</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-17-to-feature-new-scratch-resistant-anti-reflective-display.2422268/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<title>When Will Apple Announce WWDC 2024 Dates?</title>

		<description><![CDATA[The 35th annual Worldwide Developers Conference isn't set to take place until June, but we are creeping closer to the general time when Apple tends to announce the dates for its developer event.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/WWDC24-Header.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-941927" /><br/>
Apple could make its first WWDC event date announcement in less than two weeks at the end of March or the beginning of April. Here are Apple's past WWDC announcement dates:<br/>
<ul><br/>
 	<li>2023 - Wednesday, March 29</li><br/>
 	<li>2022 - Tuesday, April 5</li><br/>
 	<li>2021 - Tuesday, March 30</li><br/>
 	<li>2020 - Friday, March 13</li><br/>
 	<li>2019 - Thursday, March 14</li><br/>
 	<li>2018 - Tuesday, March 13</li><br/>
 	<li>2017 - Thursday, February 16</li><br/>
 	<li>2016 - Monday, April 18</li><br/>
 	<li>2015 - Tuesday, April 14</li><br/>
 	<li>2014 - Thursday, April 3</li><br/>
</ul><br/>
Given these dates, we could see a WWDC announcement from Apple anytime from Tuesday, March 26 to Friday, March 29, though Apple might also hold the announcement until the next week, unveiling dates on Tuesday, April 2.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>WWDC Date Possibilities</h2><br/>
For the last several years, Apple held WWDC during the first week of June, and that's also the most likely target date this year.<br/>
<br/>
June 3 to June 7 would make the most sense based on past WWDC events, though June 10 to June 14 is also possible. Past WWDC dates:<br/>
<ul><br/>
 	<li>2023 - June 5 to June 9</li><br/>
 	<li>2022 - June 6 to June 10</li><br/>
 	<li>2021 - June 7 to June 11</li><br/>
 	<li>2020 - June 22 to June 26</li><br/>
 	<li>2019 - June 3 to June 7</li><br/>
 	<li>2018 - June 4 to June 8</li><br/>
 	<li>2017 - June 5 to June 9</li><br/>
 	<li>2016 - June 12 to June 17</li><br/>
 	<li>2015 - June 8 to June 12</li><br/>
 	<li>2014 - June 2 to June 6</li><br/>
</ul><br/>
<h2>WWDC Software Announcements</h2><br/>
Apple will unveil <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a>, iPadOS 18, macOS 15, watchOS 11, tvOS 18, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod/">HomePod</a> Software 18, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/visionos/">visionOS</a> 2 at WWDC this year, and the updates will be provided to developers directly after the keynote event.<br/>
<br/>
Betas will be limited to developers for the first month or so, but if Apple follows tradition, the software will be made available through public betas in July 2024.<br/>
<br/>
&zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj; is the only update that we've heard much about, and Apple is said to be focusing heavily on artificial intelligence this year. There will be new AI additions across the OS, and <em>Bloomberg</em>'s <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a> believes it could be one of the biggest updates we've seen to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> in years. All of the rumors about <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/"><strong>what's coming in iOS 18</strong></a> can be found in our roundup.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Possible Hardware Announcements at WWDC</h2><br/>
There are no rumors yet that Apple will introduce new hardware, but we are waiting on refreshes for several Macs. Apple has yet to update the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-studio/">Mac Studio</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-mini/">Mac mini</a>, or <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-pro/">Mac Pro</a> with M3 chips, so there is a possibility that some of these new Macs will see a debut at WWDC.<br/>

		<title>Apple Working on Solution for EU Core Technology Fee Possibly Bankrupting Apps That Go Unexpectedly Viral</title>

		<description><![CDATA[Since Apple announced plans for the 0.50 euro Core Technology Fee that apps distributed using the new EU <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a> business terms must pay, there <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/25/apple-eu-fees-could-bankrupt-app-developers/">have been ongoing concerns</a> about what that fee might mean for a developer that suddenly has a free app go viral.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/App-Store-vs-EU-Feature-2.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-932826" /><br/>
Apple's VP of regulatory law Kyle Andeers today met with developers during a workshop on Apple's Digital Markets Act compliance. iOS developer Riley Testut, best known for Game Boy Advance emulator GBA4iOS, asked what Apple would do if a young developer unwittingly racked up millions in fees.<br/>
<br/>
Testut explained that when he was younger, that exact situation happened to him. Back in 2014 as an 18-year-old high school student, he released GBA4iOS outside of the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; using an enterprise certificate. The app was unexpectedly downloaded more than 10 million times, and under Apple's new rules with Core Technology Fee, Testut said that would have cost &#36;5 million euros, bankrupting his family. He asked whether Apple would actually collect that fee in a similar situation, charging the high price even though it could financially ruin a family.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe src="https://mastodon.social/@stroughtonsmith/112118127201793072/embed" class="mastodon-embed" style="max-width: 100%; border: 0" width="400" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe><script src="https://mastodon.social/embed.js" async="async"></script></div><br/>
In response, Andeers said that Apple is working on figuring out a solution, but has not done so yet. He said Apple does not want to stifle innovation and wants to figure out how to keep young app makers and their parents from feeling scared to release an app. Andeers told Testut to "stay tuned" for an answer.<blockquote>What we are trying to do is tear apart a model that has been integrated for 15 years. And so for 15 years, the way we've monetized everything was through the commission. It covered everything from technology to distribution to payment processing, and the beauty of that model is that it allowed developers to take risks. Apple only got paid if the developer got paid, and that was an incredible engine for innovation over the last 15 years. We've seen it go from 500 apps to more than 1.5 million.<br/>
<br/>
To your point, we've seen kids everywhere from 8-year-olds, 9-year-olds, 10-year-olds, to teenagers come up with some amazing applications and it's been one of the great success stories of the App Store. In terms of the Core Technology Fee and our business model, we had to change. The mandates of the DMA forced us to tear apart what we had built and price each component individually. And so we now have a fee associated with technology, tools, and services, we now have a fee associated with distribution and the services we provide through the App Store, and then we have a separate fee for payment processing if a developer wants to use it.<br/>
<br/>
To your point - what is the impact on the dreamer, the kid who is just getting started. It could be a kid, it could be an adult, it could be a grandparent. We want to continue to encourage those sorts of developers. We build a store based on individual entrepreneurs, not so much catering to large corporate interests. And so we really wanted to figure out how do we solve for that.<br/>
<br/>
We haven't figured out that solution here. I fully appreciate that. We looked at the data. We didn't see many examples of where you had that viral app or an app just took off that incurred huge costs. That said, I don't care what the data said. We don't care what the data said. We want people to continue to feel... and not be scared... some parents... hey, I've got four kids who play around with this stuff. I don't have five million euros to pay. This is something we need to figure out, and it is something we're working on. So I would say on that one, stay tuned.</blockquote><br/>
It is not clear when Apple might come up with a solution or what that solution might be, but it sounds like the company might soon have some kind of option for these rare fringe cases when an app goes unexpectedly viral.<br/>
<br/>
The 0.50 euro Core Technology Fee (CTF) that Apple is charging applies to all apps created under Apple's new business terms, both those distributed in the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; and those distributed outside of the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; in the European Union. The CTF must be paid for every "first" app install over one million installs.<br/>
<br/>
A free app that is distributed outside of the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; and downloaded over a million times will owe 0.50 euros for every subsequent "first" install, aka the first time a customer downloads an app on a device each year. The fee is incurred whether or not an app charges, creating a situation where an app developer could owe Apple money without ever making a dime.<br/>
<br/>
As it stands, the CTF is a major unknown for any kind of freemium or free app built under the new business terms that might go viral, effectively making it very risky to develop a free or freemium app outside of the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj;. A free or freemium app that gets two million annual "first installs" would need to pay an estimated &#36;45,290 in fees per month, or more than half a million dollars per year, even with no money earned. That's not a sustainable model for free apps, and freemium apps would need to earn at least 0.50 euros per user to break even.<br/>
<br/>
App developers are able to continue to use Apple's current &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; business terms instead of adopting the new terms, paying just 15 to 30 percent commission to Apple with no change. That prevents distribution outside of the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj;, and it prevents developers from using third-party alternative payment solutions in the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj;. Adopting any of the new features that Apple has implemented because of the Digital Markets Act requires opting in to the updated business terms.<br/>
<br/>
Apple has been tweaking the app ecosystem rules that it introduced in the European Union based on developer feedback. Developers can now opt <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/05/apple-tweaks-eu-app-store-business-terms/">back in to the current App Store rules</a> after trying out the new rules, though this is only available one time. Apple also recently did away with an app marketplace restriction that required alternative marketplaces to offer apps from any third-party developer that wanted to participate.<br/>
<br/>
Third-party app stores are now able to offer apps only from their own catalog, and developers will soon be able to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/12/apple-announces-app-downloads-from-websites/">distribute apps directly from their websites</a> as long as they meet Apple's requirements. Note that all of these changes are limited to the European Union, and the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; is operating as before in the United States and other countries.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/european-union/">European Union</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-developer-program/">Apple Developer Program</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/18/apple-eu-core-technology-fee-viral-solution/">Apple Working on Solution for EU Core Technology Fee Possibly Bankrupting Apps That Go Unexpectedly Viral</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-working-on-solution-for-eu-core-technology-fee-possibly-bankrupting-apps-that-go-unexpectedly-viral.2422232/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

<em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman also said the new iPad Pro models might not ship until "deeper" into April <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-03-17/apple-aapl-revamped-carplay-becomes-last-hope-after-apple-car-is-canceled-ltvif8zt">in his <em>Power On</em> newsletter</a> on Sunday:<blockquote>I've repeatedly said that new software for the iPad Pro — a variant of iPadOS 17.4 designed for the updated models —  won't be complete until the end of March or even sometime in April. Once the OS is finished, Apple needs to send it off to the factories to be installed on the new hardware. That process could last a couple weeks, probably taking us deeper into next month.</blockquote>Young expects Apple to announce the new iPad Pro models in "late March or early April," so the devices could still be unveiled later this month. Gurman has also said that an announcement is possible <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/11/new-ipads-end-of-march-or-april-gurman/">as early as the "end of March."</a><br/>
<br/>
Young reiterated that Apple plans to launch a larger 12.9-inch iPad Air as well, and it will likely be announced alongside the new iPad Pro models.<br/>

The following iPad-related announcements are expected in March or April:<ul><li>Two new iPad Pro models with the M3 chip, OLED displays, a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/20/upcoming-oled-ipad-pro-thinner/">thinner enclosure</a>, a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/08/ipad-air-ipad-pro-landscape-facetime-camera/">landscape-oriented front camera</a>, a redesigned rear camera bump and other design tweaks, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/18/ipad-pro-magsafe-charging/">possibly MagSafe wireless charging</a></li><br/>
<li>Two new iPad Air models with the M2 chip and a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/08/ipad-air-ipad-pro-landscape-facetime-camera/">landscape-oriented front camera</a>, including a first-ever 12.9-inch model</li><br/>
<li>A new Magic Keyboard for the iPad Pro with a larger trackpad, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/03/gurman-new-ipad-magic-keyboard-to-feature-aluminum/">a partially-aluminum enclosure</a>, and other design tweaks</li><br/>
<li>A <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/05/new-apple-pencil-to-launch-this-month/">new Apple Pencil</a></li></ul>Gurman previously <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/03/no-apple-event-for-new-ipads-macs-gurman/">ruled out an Apple Event for the new iPads</a>. Instead, the devices will likely be announced in a press release on the Apple Newsroom website, like the 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Air models with the M3 chip <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/04/apple-announces-m3-macbook-air/">were earlier this month</a>.<br/>

Young said Samsung will be the exclusive supplier of OLED displays for the 12.9-inch iPad Pro, while Samsung and LG will apparently split orders for the 11.1-inch model.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/">iPad Air </a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ross-young/">Ross Young</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPad-Air">iPad Air (Don't Buy)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#11-iPad-Pro">11" iPad Pro (Don't Buy)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#12-9-iPad-Pro">12.9" iPad Pro (Don't Buy)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipad.137">iPad</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/18/new-ipads-likely-to-begin-shipping-in-april/">New iPads Likely to Begin Shipping in April</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/new-ipads-likely-to-begin-shipping-in-april.2422217/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>
