		<description><![CDATA[Apple's annual developer conference has come to a close for 2025, and WWDC was packed with announcements right from the start of Monday's keynote. As expected, we got a unified numbering scheme across Apple's platforms, as well as a redesign that makes for a more cohesive experience.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/06/top-stories-2025-06-14.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1006202" /><br/>
Alongside the redesigns, all of Apple's operating systems are also seeing a host of feature additions and improvements, and developers are able to access beta versions now to help get their apps ready for a public release of the new operating system versions later this year. Read on below for a high-level overview of Apple's WWDC announcements!<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Everything Apple Announced at WWDC 2025 in 10 Minutes</h2><br/>
At this week's WWDC 2025 keynote event, Apple unveiled a new design that will inform the next decade of iOS, iPadOS, and macOS development, so needless to say, it was a busy day. Apple also unveiled a ton of new features for the iPhone, an overhauled Spotlight interface for the Mac, and a ton of updates that make the iPad more like a Mac than ever before.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/06/Everything-WWDC25-Thumb-3.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1005197" /><br/>
Apple's event lasted for an hour and a half, but <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/09/everything-apple-announced-wwdc-2025/">we've recapped all of the announcements in a 10-minute video</a>, just in case you don't want to sit through the entire spiel. We've also <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/09/everything-apple-announced-wwdc-2025/">rounded up all of our coverage from the day</a>, so you can dive deeper into any of the new features, while Dan and Hartley sat down with Kevin Nether at Apple Park for an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/13/the-macrumors-show-wwdc-2025-recap/">on-location episode of The MacRumors Show</a> discussing Apple's announcements.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Apple Announces iOS 26 With 'Liquid Glass' Design, Live Translation, Overhauled Phone App, and More</h2><br/>
Apple at WWDC <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/09/apple-announces-ios-26/">announced iOS 26</a>, introducing a comprehensive visual redesign built around its new "Liquid Glass" concept, alongside expanded Apple Intelligence capabilities, updates to core communication apps, and more.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/06/Apple-WWDC25-iOS-26-hero-250609.jpg" alt="" width="3840" height="2160" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1005070" /><br/>
Liquid Glass is a translucent material that reflects and refracts surroundings to create dynamic, responsive interface elements, according to Apple. The new design language transforms the Lock Screen, where the time fluidly adapts to available space in wallpapers, and spatial scenes add 3D effects when users move their iPhone. Meanwhile, app icons and widgets gain new customization options, including a striking clear appearance.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Apple Unveils macOS Tahoe With Liquid Glass Design, Phone App, Live Translation, and More</h2><br/>
Apple this week <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/09/apple-unveils-macos-tahoe-26/">announced macOS Tahoe 26</a> at WWDC 2025, introducing a striking visual redesign alongside expanded Apple Intelligence capabilities and new Continuity features that further integrate Mac and iPhone workflows.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/06/macos-tahoe.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1004989" /><br/>
Similar to iOS 26, macOS Tahoe updates center around what Apple calls a "gorgeous new design" built with Liquid Glass, a translucent material that reflects surrounding elements. The Dock, sidebars, and toolbars have been refined to emphasize content, while a completely transparent menu bar makes displays feel larger. Users gain extensive personalization options, including colorful app icon tints, customizable folder colors with emoji symbols, and enhanced Control Center layouts.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Apple Announces watchOS 26 With Liquid Glass Design, Workout Buddy, and Smart Stack Intelligence</h2><br/>
Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/09/apple-announces-watchos-26/">announced watchOS 26</a> at WWDC, carrying over the "Liquid Glass" design language from iOS 26 to the wrist while delivering a new AI-powered fitness feature called Workout Buddy and updated Smart Stack functionality.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/06/watchOS-26-Apple-Newsroom.jpg" alt="" width="1960" height="1102" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1005003" /><br/>
Liquid Glass uses real-time rendering to create translucent interface elements that reflect and refract content. The design appears across Smart Stack widgets, Control Center, notifications, and in-app navigation. The Photos watch face also receives numerals made of Liquid Glass, showing more of users' photos through the display.<br/>
<br/>
Workout Buddy uses Apple Intelligence to analyze workout data and fitness history, providing spoken motivation during exercise sessions, while the Smart Stack adds a hints feature using contextual data, sensor information, and routine patterns for actionable suggestions. These appear as visual prompts on the display, such as Backtrack in remote locations or workout suggestions when arriving at fitness locations.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>tvOS 26 Adds These New Features to Your Apple TV</h2><br/>
Apple this week <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/10/tvos-26-new-features/">announced tvOS 26</a>, which is now available in developer beta. The upcoming software update includes a handful of new features for the Apple TV, although some of the changes are only available on newer models.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/06/tvOS-26-Apple-Newsroom.jpg" alt="" width="1960" height="1103" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1005068" /><br/>
The most obvious change is the new Liquid Glass design, which was also introduced across iOS 26, iPadOS 26, macOS 26, and watchOS 26. The new design language includes shimmery app icons, and translucent elements that reflect colors. The new design is only visible on the Apple TV 4K (2nd generation) and Apple TV 4K (3rd generation).<br/>
<br/>
Other new features in tvOS 26 include an optional new user profile selection screen at wake-up, the ability to use an iPhone as a microphone for Apple Music Sing, FaceTime improvements, new Aerial screen savers, and more.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>visionOS 26 Announced With Spatial Widgets, Shared Experiences, Enhanced Personas, and More</h2><br/>
Apple at WWDC <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/09/visionos-26-enhanced-personas/">announced visionOS 26</a>, bringing spatial widgets, dramatically improved Personas, and new collaborative experiences to Apple Vision Pro users.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/06/visionos-26.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1005008" /><br/>
Apple says the update transforms widgets into spatial objects that integrate seamlessly into users' physical environments. These customizable widgets — including Clock, Weather, Music, and Photos — offer unique interactions and persist in space each time users don Vision Pro. Users can decorate their surroundings with panoramas, spatial photos, distinctive clock faces, and quick access to Apple Music playlists. The new Widgets app helps discover compatible widgets from iOS and iPadOS apps, according to Apple.<br/>
<br/>
Elsewhere, Personas receive their most significant upgrade yet, leveraging volumetric rendering and machine learning for striking expressivity and sharpness. The enhanced avatars now display full side profiles with remarkably accurate hair, lashes, and complexion details.<br/>
<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today launched a <a href="https://support.apple.com/mac-mini-2023-service-program-for-no-power-issue">repair program</a> for Mac mini models with the M2 chip, after it determined that a "very small percentage" of these computers may no longer power on. No other Mac mini models are part of this program.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/01/Mac-mini-M2-2023.jpeg" alt="" width="1200" height="630" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-882043" /><br/>
If your Mac mini has exhibited this issue, you can enter its serial number <a href="https://support.apple.com/mac-mini-2023-service-program-for-no-power-issue">on Apple's website</a> to see if it is eligible for this program. If it is, Apple or an Apple Authorized Service Provider will provide service, free of charge.<br/>
<br/>
Mac mini models with the M2 chip were first released in 2023, but Apple says that affected units were manufactured between June 16 and November 23 of 2024.<br/>
<br/>
The worldwide program covers an eligible Mac mini for up to three years after it was purchased.<br/>
<br/>
Apple did not provide a reason for the power issue.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-mini/">Mac mini</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/repair-program/">Repair Program</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Mac_Mini">Mac Mini (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/mac-mini.146">Mac mini</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/13/apple-launches-2023-mac-mini-repair-program/">Apple Launches 2023 Mac Mini Repair Program Due to Power Issue</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-launches-2023-mac-mini-repair-program-due-to-power-issue.2458984/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/visual-intelligence/">Visual Intelligence</a>, an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/">Apple Intelligence</a> feature that Apple introduced last year, has some new capabilities in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-26/">iOS 26</a> that make it more useful and better able to compete with the functionality available through some Android smartphones.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/06/visual-lookup-ios-26.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1006213" /><br/>
<h2 id="onscreen_awareness">Onscreen Awareness</h2><br/>
In <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a>, &zwnj;Visual Intelligence&zwnj; only works with the camera, but in &zwnj;iOS 26&zwnj;, it also works with what's on your device. You can capture a screenshot of what's on your screen and then use &zwnj;Visual Intelligence&zwnj; on it to identify what you're looking at, find images, and get more information through ChatGPT.<br/>
<br/>
<h3 id="how_to_get_use_onscreen_awareness_for_visual_intelligence">How to Get Use Onscreen Awareness for Visual Intelligence</h3><br/>
&zwnj;Visual Intelligence&zwnj; for screenshots works about the same as &zwnj;Visual Intelligence&zwnj; with the camera app, but it's located in the screenshot interface. Take a screenshot (hold down the volume up button and the side button), and then tap out of the Markup interface if it's showing.<br/>
<br/>
To get out of Markup (which is the default view), tap on the little pen icon at the top of the display. From there, you should see the &zwnj;Visual Intelligence&zwnj; options.<br/>
<br/>
<h3 id="highlight_to_search">Highlight to Search</h3><br/>
With Highlight to Search for &zwnj;Visual Intelligence&zwnj; onscreen content awareness, you can use a finger to draw over the object in the screenshot that you want to look up. It's similar to Android's Circle to Search feature.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/06/visual-intelligence-screenshot-ios-26.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1006214" /><br/>
Highlight to Search lets you conduct an image search for a specific object in a screenshot, even if there are multiple things in the picture. It uses Google Image search by default, but Apple showed off the feature working with other apps like Etsy during its keynote event. Apps will likely need to add support for the feature. <br/>
<br/>
In some cases, &zwnj;Visual Intelligence&zwnj; will identify individual objects in an image on its own, and you can tap without needing to use Highlight to Search. This is similar to the object identification feature in the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/photos/">Photos</a> app, but it still leads to an image search.<br/>
<br/>
<h3 id="ask_and_search">Ask and Search</h3><br/>
If you don't need to isolate one object in your screenshot, you can simply tap on the Ask button to ask questions about what you're seeing. Questions will be relayed to ChatGPT, and ChatGPT will provide the information. The Search button queries Google Search for more information. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/06/visual-intelligence-ios-26-screenshots.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1006215" /><br/>
As with the standard Visual Search, if your screenshot includes dates, times, and related information for an event, it can be added directly to your calendar. <br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="new_object_identification">New Object Identification</h2><br/>
Apple didn't mention it, but &zwnj;Visual Intelligence&zwnj; adds support for quick identification of new types of objects. It can now identify art, books, landmarks, natural landmarks, and sculptures, in addition to the animals and plants it was able to provide information on before.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/06/visual-lookup-books-ios-26.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1006216" /><br/>
If you use &zwnj;Visual Intelligence&zwnj; on an object that it is able to recognize, you'll see a small glowing icon pop up. Tapping on it reveals information about what's in view. What's neat about this aspect of &zwnj;Visual Intelligence&zwnj; is that it works with the live camera view or with a snapped photo.<br/>
<br/>
For standard Ask and Search requests using &zwnj;Visual Intelligence&zwnj;, you have to take a photo so that it can be relayed to sources like ChatGPT or Google Image Search. Art, books, landmarks, natural landmarks, sculptures, plants, and animals can be identified on-device without contacting another service.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="compatibility">Compatibility</h2><br/>
&zwnj;Visual Intelligence&zwnj; is limited to devices that support &zwnj;Apple Intelligence&zwnj;, which includes the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a> Pro models and the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a> models. It is activated by a long press on the Camera Control button on devices that have Camera Control, or using the Action Button or a Control Center toggle.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="launch_date">Launch Date</h2><br/>
&zwnj;iOS 26&zwnj; is in beta testing right now, but it will launch to the public in September.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-26/">iOS 26</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ios-26-visual-intelligence/">Here&#039;s What&#039;s New With Visual Intelligence in iOS 26</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/heres-whats-new-with-visual-intelligence-in-ios-26.2458979/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today added M4 <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/">MacBook Air</a> models to <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/refurbished/mac/macbook-air">its refurbished store</a> in the United States, making the latest &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; devices available at a discounted price for the first time since they launched earlier this year.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/05/m4-macbook-air-pink.jpeg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1000372" /><br/>
Both 13-inch and 15-inch &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; models are available, with Apple offering multiple capacities and configurations. The refurbished devices are discounted by approximately 15 percent compared to equivalent new models. Pricing starts at &#36;849 for the <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/FW0W3LL/A/Refurbished-13-inch-MacBook-Air-Apple-M4-chip-with-10%E2%80%91Core-CPU-and-8%E2%80%91Core-GPU-Silver">base M4 MacBook Air model</a>, down from &#36;999.<br/>
<br/>
Refurbished stock will fluctuate as Apple sells its current inventory and replaces it with new devices, but there are over 30 options to choose from right now if you've been holding out for a discounted M4 model.<br/>
<br/>
Apple's refurbished Macs are identical to new products. Apple uses a refurbishment process with full functionality testing, thorough cleaning, battery replacement, and inspection. Refurbished devices are eligible for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/applecare/">AppleCare</a>+ and have the same 14-day return period as new devices.<br/>
<br/>
Refurbished <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m4-mac-mini/">M4 Mac mini</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro/">MacBook Pro</a> models have been available for purchase <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/12/apple-refurbished-m4-macs/">since February</a>, and Apple began offering refurbished versions of the M4 Max and M3 Ultra <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-studio/">Mac Studio</a> <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/12/refurbished-mac-studio-m4-max-m3-ultra/">earlier this week</a>.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/13/apple-refurbished-m4-macbook-air/">Apple Now Selling Refurbished M4 MacBook Air Models</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-now-selling-refurbished-m4-macbook-air-models.2458976/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[With <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-26/">iOS 26</a>, Apple is adding support for transferring an eSIM from an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> to an Android device, and vice versa. The new functionality will make it easier for smartphone users to move their numbers between platforms, alleviating the need to contact a carrier for help with a transition between &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; and Android.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/06/ios-26-android-transfer-esim.jpg" alt="" width="3813" height="2145" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1006208" /><br/>
Some &zwnj;iOS 26&zwnj; users <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/USMobile/comments/1l905db/ios_26_dark_star_native_esim_transfer_to_android/">have noticed</a> a "Transfer to Android" option in their cellular settings, though it is not an option for all plans at the current time. On Reddit, an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; user with US Mobile's Dark Star eSIM found a cellular option to transfer an eSIM to an Android device.<br/>
<br/>
When adding an eSIM in &zwnj;iOS 26&zwnj;, there's also a "Transfer From Android" option. Tapping on it provides a QR code that can be scanned with an Android device to start the transfer process, and that's also how the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; to Android transfer process works.<br/>
<br/>
Apple appears to have implemented the new functionality alongside Google. Prior to when &zwnj;iOS 26&zwnj; debuted, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/27/ios-19-esim-android-transfer/">an Android 16 beta</a> featured a reference to a "Transfer to Android" feature that hinted at the new cross-platform transferring options.<br/>
<br/>
In <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a>, it is simple to transfer an eSIM from &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; to &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;, but it is not easy to transfer an eSIM from an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; to an Android device. It typically requires contacting a carrier to get a QR code, as there is no automated way to make the transition. With &zwnj;iOS 26&zwnj;, many &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; users who want to move to Android should have an easier time doing so.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-26/">iOS 26</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/13/ios-26-esim-android/">iOS 26 Adds Support for Transferring an eSIM to and From Android</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-26-adds-support-for-transferring-an-esim-to-and-from-android.2458972/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple this week <a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/whats-new/#in-app-purchase">announced</a> that App Store app developers will be able to offer redemption codes for all types of in-app purchases starting later this year.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/05/Mac-App-Store-General-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2250" height="1266" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-800078" /><br/>
In 2020, Apple introduced the ability for developers to offer customers unique, alphanumeric codes that they can redeem in the App Store <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2020/09/02/apple-developer-subscription-codes/">for free or discounted auto-renewable subscriptions</a>. Later this year, Apple will be allowing developers to offer these codes for any in-app purchases, including consumable items like in-game currency.<br/>
<br/>
Apple previously said that developers can offer customers these one-time codes digitally, such as through an email, or offline at physical events. For example, the team behind Clash of Clans could promote the game at a convention by offering customers who walk by their booth a card with a redemption code for a free or discounted Sack of Gems.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/13/apple-offer-codes-for-all-in-app-purchases/">Apple Says iPhone Games Can Offer Redemption Codes Later This Year</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-says-iphone-games-can-offer-redemption-codes-later-this-year.2458967/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/06/iOS-26-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1005033" /><br/>
"Depending on the amount of free space available, iOS might dynamically reserve update space for Automatic Updates to download and install successfully," says Apple's <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/ios-ipados-release-notes/ios-ipados-26-release-notes">release notes</a> for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/09/apple-ios-26-developer-beta/">first iOS 26 developer beta</a>.<br/>
<br/>
This change will ensure that iPhone users who have Automatic Updates turned on in the Settings app actually have enough storage space available for those updates to download and install. However, Apple has not shared any further information about this capability at this time, so it is unclear exactly how it works.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-26/">iOS 26</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/13/ios-26-can-reserve-space-for-automatic-updates/">Apple Says iOS 26 Can Reserve Space for Automatic Software Updates</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-says-ios-26-can-reserve-space-for-automatic-software-updates.2458959/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple this week <a href="https://developer.apple.com/tvos/whats-new/">introduced</a> a new <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/automaticsigninapi">Automatic Sign-In API</a>, which will make it easier to sign in to apps across multiple Apple devices.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/02/apple-tv-app-1.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="966" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-785920" /><br/>
Starting with Apple's latest software releases, such as iOS 26 and tvOS 26, you will be able to sign in to a supported app on one Apple device and automatically be signed in to the app on other Apple devices. For example, if you sign in to the Disney+ app on your iPhone, you would automatically be signed in to the Disney+ app on your Apple TV. However, it will take time for developers to begin implementing this functionality.<br/>
<br/>
Apple says this feature will eliminate the need to re-enter usernames and passwords across its software platforms, by linking app logins to a user's Apple Account.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today provided developers with a revised version of the first <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-26/">iOS 26</a> beta for testing purposes. The update is only available for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a> models, so if you're running &zwnj;iOS 26&zwnj; on an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> 14 or earlier, you won't see the revised beta.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1005033" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/06/iOS-26-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" /><br/>
Registered developers can download the new beta software through the Settings app on each device.<br/>
<br/>
The revised beta addresses an issue that could cause some &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; models to show a low battery symbol and be unable to start up after updating to the initial &zwnj;iOS 26&zwnj; beta. <br/>
<br/>
&zwnj;iOS 26&zwnj; includes all of the new features that were shown off at Apple's keynote event on Monday. Apple debuted its Liquid Glass design, which you'll find throughout &zwnj;iOS 26&zwnj; and Apple's other software updates.<br/>
<br/>
Along with a refreshed design, there are a long list of new features in &zwnj;iOS 26&zwnj;, including changes to Messages, Phone, Safari, Music, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/photos/">Photos</a>, Camera, and more.<br/>
<br/>
While today's beta is limited to developers to give them time to learn the new features and adjust their apps, Apple will provide public beta testers with a chance to try the software in July. &zwnj;iOS 26&zwnj;, iPadOS 26, macOS 26, tvOS 26, watchOS 26, and visionOS 26 are set to launch to the public in September.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-26/">iOS 26</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/13/apple-seeds-revised-ios-26-developer-beta/">Apple Seeds Revised iOS 26 Developer Beta to Fix Battery Issue</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-seeds-revised-ios-26-developer-beta-to-fix-battery-issue.2458953/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple this week <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/09/apple-announces-ios-26/">announced iOS 26</a>, and the upcoming software update includes many new features and changes for CarPlay.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/06/CarPlay-Liquid-Glass-Light.jpg" alt="" width="1960" height="1102" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1005142" /><br/>
To try out these features now, you will need to be using an iPhone running iOS 26, which is currently available in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/09/apple-ios-26-developer-beta/">developer beta</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Below, we recap nine changes to CarPlay.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Liquid Glass Design</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/06/CarPlay-Liquid-Glass-Dark.jpg" alt="" width="1960" height="1102" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1005143" /><br/>
When you are using CarPlay with an iPhone running iOS 26, the new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/09/apple-announces-liquid-glass/">Liquid Glass design</a> extends to the CarPlay interface. Like on the iPhone, the new look includes more shimmery app icons and translucent user interface elements.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>New Messages App Features</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/06/CarPlay-Messages-Tapbacks.jpg" alt="" width="1960" height="1102" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1005144" /><br/>
Starting with iOS 26, you can respond to messages with standard Tapbacks like a heart, thumbs up, or exclamation marks directly through CarPlay.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Pinned Conversations</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/06/CarPlay-Pinned-Messages.jpg" alt="" width="1960" height="1102" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1005145" /><br/>
You can now view your pinned conversations in the Messages app on CarPlay.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Compact View for Phone Calls</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/06/CarPlay-Compact-Phone-Calls.jpg" alt="" width="1942" height="1088" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1005147" /><br/>
CarPlay has a new compact view for incoming phone calls, so that you can still see other information on the screen, such as turn-by-turn directions.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Live Activities</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/06/CarPlay-Live-Activities.jpg" alt="" width="1960" height="1102" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1005141" /><br/>
CarPlay's Dashboard screen can now show Live Activities, letting you keep track of things like a flight's arrival time at a glance.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Widgets</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/06/CarPlay-Widgets.jpg" alt="" width="1960" height="1102" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1005146" /><br/>
The regular version of CarPlay now has a widgets screen, for things like calendar appointments and HomeKit accessory controls.<br/>
<br/>
Widgets were previously limited to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/15/apples-carplay-ultra-now-available/">CarPlay Ultra</a>.<br/>
<br/>
On a related note, all of these new features are coming to CarPlay Ultra.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Multi-Touch Maps</h2><br/>
Starting with iOS 26, CarPlay users can interact with mapping apps <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/12/apple-highlights-two-smaller-carplay-changes/">using multi-touch gestures</a> in supported vehicles. This allows users to zoom and pan on the map with their fingers, just like they can on an iPhone.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Watch Videos While Parked</h2><br/>
iPhone users will be able to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/12/carplay-airplay-video-in-the-car/">wirelessly stream videos to the CarPlay screen</a> using AirPlay, according to Apple. For safety reasons, video playback will only be available when the vehicle is parked, to prevent distracted driving. The connected iPhone will be able to detect when the vehicle is in motion and end playback.<br/>
<br/>
Automakers need to add support for this feature, so it might be limited to newer vehicles and take some time to roll out.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Smart Display Zoom</h2><br/>
iOS 26 adds a new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/12/carplay-smart-display-zoom-setting/">Smart Display Zoom setting</a> to CarPlay.<br/>
<br/>
When the setting is enabled, CarPlay will be automatically resized to better fit the shape and size of your vehicle's dashboard screen, if possible.<br/>
<br/>
The images below show what CarPlay looks like before and after the Smart Display Zoom setting is enabled. With the setting turned on, all of the user interface elements become smaller, allowing for an extra row of app icons to fit on the screen.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/06/CarPlay-Smart-Display-Zoom-Before.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1006000" /><em>Before</em></div><div class="center-wrap"><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/06/CarPlay-Smart-Display-Zoom-After.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1006001" /><em>After</em></div><br/>

		<description><![CDATA[iPadOS 26 allows iPads to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/09/the-ipad-just-got-a-lot-more-like-a-mac/">function much more like Macs</a>, with a new app windowing system, a swipe-down menu bar at the top of the screen, and more. However, Apple has stopped short of allowing iPads to run macOS, and it has now explained why.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/06/iPadOS-26-App-Windowing.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1006126" /><br/>
In an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9M7w9it-Pf8">interview</a> this week with Swiss tech journalist Rafael Zeier, Apple's software engineering chief Craig Federighi said that iPadOS 26's new Mac-like features strike a good balance between productivity and simplicity. He added that macOS is not optimized for touch-screens, although rumors suggest that might change one day.<br/>
<br/>
"We want to retain all the simplicity of the iPad, but still allow iPad users who want to go deeper and further to push it at their own pace to doing more," said Federighi, in a sit-down interview at Apple Park's podcast studio. "I think with macOS, you'd lose what makes iPad iPad, which is the ultimate touch device. But there are lots of things the two platforms can learn from one another, and that's where we've adapted our best ideas to each."<br/>
<br/>
The quote above is only a portion of Federighi's answer, with the full interview available below.<br/>

For those who are still looking for a true iPad and Mac hybrid, Apple is reportedly working on everything from <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/01/11/touchscreen-macs-report/">touch-screen Macs</a> to a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/17/apple-foldable-macos-prediction/">19-inch foldable iPad</a>, so the dream of using macOS on a touch-screen might be just a few years away.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/wwdc/">WWDC 2025</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/craig-federighi/">Craig Federighi</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPad-Pro">iPad Pro (Caution)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-inc-and-tech-industry.8">Apple, Inc and Tech Industry</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/13/apple-explains-why-ipads-dont-just-run-macos/">Apple Explains Why iPads Don&#039;t Just Run macOS</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-explains-why-ipads-dont-just-run-macos.2458942/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Alongside WWDC this week, Logitech announced notable new accessories for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a>. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/06/Logitech-Logo-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1006049" /><br/>
The <a href="https://news.logitech.com/press-releases/news-details/2025/Introducing-Logitech-Muse-for-Apple-Vision-Pro/default.aspx">Logitech Muse</a> is a spatially-tracked stylus developed for use with the &zwnj;Apple Vision Pro&zwnj;. Introduced during the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/wwdc/">WWDC 2025</a> keynote address, Muse is intended to support the next generation of spatial computing workflows enabled by visionOS 26. The device incorporates six degrees of freedom (6DoF) tracking, pressure-sensitive tips, and real-time haptic feedback to allow users to interact with digital environments through precise input and tactile realism.<br/>
<br/>
According to Logitech, Muse is intended for use across a wide range of spatial computing applications, including 3D design, collaborative workspaces, and immersive visualization tools. During the keynote, the Muse stylus was used to draw freehand in virtual space, annotate objects, and measure dimensions of virtual items. The device features both physical buttons and gesture controls. Muse will be available later in 2025 through both Logitech and Apple.<br/>
<br/>

Logitech also <a href="https://news.logitech.com/press-releases/news-details/2025/New-Logitech-Flip-Folio-Keeps-Up-with-Your-Every-Move/default.aspx">introduced the Flip Folio</a>, a versatile new keyboard case for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/">iPad Air</a> models. The accessory includes a full-size Bluetooth keyboard that magnetically attaches to the back of the protective folio case when not in use. The case also includes a multi-angle kickstand that supports both landscape and portrait orientations.<br/>
<br/>

The Flip Folio is compatible with the 11-inch and 13-inch M4 &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; models, as well as the 11-inch and 13-inch <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m2/">M2</a> and M3 &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj;. It also supports the 5th generation &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj;. The keyboard includes dedicated shortcut keys and supports pairing with up to three Bluetooth devices simultaneously. The keyboard is powered by replaceable coin cell batteries with an estimated battery life of up to two years under typical usage.<br/>
<br/>

The Flip Folio is priced at &#36;179.99 in the United States for the 13-inch version and &#36;159.99 for the 11-inch model. Logitech is launching the Flip Folio in several colorways: Graphite and Black will be available globally in June 2025, though Black is exclusive to North America.

		<description><![CDATA[In macOS Tahoe, Apple introduces the concept of Themes, with new appearance settings that go beyond the traditional Light and Dark modes, allowing you to customize the look of your Mac desktop more than ever. Here's what's changed.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/06/macOS-Tahoe-Tinted-App-Icons.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1005655" /><br/>
In System Settings ➝ Appearance, there are still the standard Auto, Light, and Dark modes, but Apple has added several options that allow you to really mix things up and create your own stylized desktop environment.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/06/tahoe-appearance-1.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="1041" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1006073" /><div class="center-wrap"><em>The new Theme section in Appearance settings</em></div><br/>
"Accent color" has become "Color," and there's a new "Text highlight color" option, so you can now make highlighted text appear in a different shade to buttons, pop‑up menus, radio buttons, checkboxes, and focused outlines.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/06/text-highlight-1.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="1041" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1006074" /><div class="center-wrap"><em>The new Text highlight color option</em></div><br/>
The default setting maintains the classic macOS look with app icons displaying their original colors. But you can now customize folder colors independently through a dedicated new "Folder Color" setting. When set to Automatic, folders retain their traditional blue appearance, but switching to other colors like purple will change all folder colors system-wide.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/06/folder-color-1.jpg" alt="" width="2940" height="1912" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1006079" /><div class="center-wrap"><em>The new Folder color option</em></div><br/>
Meanwhile, a new "Icon & widget style" section offers three distinct modes alongside the Default. Like <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a>, the new Dark option applies black backgrounds to icons throughout the system interface, including System Settings sidebar icons (this works in both Light and Dark modes). You can set this to Always or Automatic, which switches to dark icons at night while maintaining the default appearance during daylight hours.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/06/dark-icons-widgets-macos-1.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="1041" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1006080" /><div class="center-wrap"><em>Dark icon & widget style (shown in Dark mode)</em></div><br/>
The new Clear setting emphasizes the Liquid Glass redesign and adds a new transparency by picking up background colors, creating a more translucent interface effect. Clear also includes Light and Dark variants, or it can be set to Auto for automatic day-night switching.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/06/clear-dark-1.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="1041" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1006082" /><div class="center-wrap"><em>The new Clear icon & widget style (shown in Dark mode)</em></div><br/>
Most notably, the Tinted option allows comprehensive color customization of both icons and folders. With "Tinted" selected, the Folder color setting becomes "Icon, widget & folder color," allowing you to select from preset colors or choose custom tints using the Other option (which includes a color picker and a theme color). Tinted mode can also be configured as Light or Dark for a more subdued appearance or set to Auto for time-based switching.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/06/appearance-tint-macos-1.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="1041" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1006084" /><div class="center-wrap"><em>The new Tinted icon & widget style (shown in Dark mode)</em></div><br/>
Overall, the new Theme enhancements ensure "personalization parity" between macOS and iOS. Apple is offering unprecedented control over your desktop's visual appearance, but you still get system-wide consistency across interface elements. For added visual customization, you can even add a symbol or emoji to folders for a unique flair. What do you think of the new Theme options in macOS 26?

		<title>Apple Says iPhone XS is Now Vintage</title>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today added the iPhone XS to the <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/102772">vintage products list</a> on its website.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/iPhone-XS-Max-Black-Background.jpeg" alt="" width="1500" height="844" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-909569" /><br/>
Apple considers a device to be "vintage" once five years have passed since the company stopped distributing it for sale. Apple Stores and Apple Authorized Service Providers may still offer repairs for vintage devices, subject to parts availability.<br/>
<br/>
Apple released the iPhone XS in September 2018, and it was discontinued a year later. However, the device remained available through select resellers for longer, so it has only recently reached the five-year mark for vintage status.<br/>
<br/>
In two more years from now, the iPhone XS will be classified as fully obsolete, at which point Apple will no longer service the device.<br/>
<br/>
Apple already classified the larger iPhone XS Max as vintage <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/15/apple-adds-two-iphone-models-to-vintage-list/">in November 2024</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Overall, the iPhone XS was a relatively minor upgrade over the iPhone X. The device's key new features included a faster A12 Bionic chip, improved cameras, and dual SIM support, while the iPhone XS Max offered a larger 6.5-inch display.<br/>
<br/>
Apple also moved the iPad 5 from the vintage list to the obsolete list today.<br/>
<br/>
Last, Apple added fine print to the page that says 2018 Mac mini owners should check with an Apple Authorized Service Provider to determine the service status of that computer, which was added to the vintage list <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/15/apple-vintage-list-mac-iphone/">a few months ago</a>. It seemed a bit early for this model to be considered vintage, but the situation is not clear to us.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/vintage-and-obsolete/">Vintage and Obsolete Apple Products</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/13/apple-says-iphone-xs-is-now-vintage/">Apple Says iPhone XS is Now Vintage</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-says-iphone-xs-is-now-vintage.2458937/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PLEMgne2oIY?si=g48jLMkpg5oSl9U_" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@themacrumorsshow?sub_confirmation=1">Subscribe to The MacRumors Show YouTube channel</a> for more videos</em></div><br/>
Apple introduced a uniform naming scheme across its platforms—iOS, iPadOS, watchOS, tvOS, visionOS, and macOS are now versioned by the calendar year. This includes macOS 26, titled "Tahoe." The update marks the final macOS release to support Intel-based Macs.<br/>
<br/>
Liquid Glass is a new translucent design language inspired by visionOS. It dynamically refracts and reflects its surroundings across icons, menus, widgets, and controls, introducing a clear, immersive home screen experience. This is Apple's most sweeping visual refresh since iOS 7.<br/>
<br/>
Nearly all of the new features in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-26/">iOS 26</a> carry over to Apple's other platforms. Messages gains chat backgrounds, polls, and typing indicators in group threads. A new Games app aggregates event feeds, community tabs, and "Play Together" social features. The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/photos/">Photos</a> app returns to a Library/Collections tabbed interface and introduces spatialized photo effects. Battery settings now include recharge‑time estimates and adaptive power mode. The Phone app is redesigned (and extended to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> and Mac) with unified design, call screening, and Hold Assist. <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/">Apple Music</a> offers animated album art full-screen, Music pins, AutoMix DJ transitions, and lyric translation. Finally, Maps introduces a "Visited Places" feature leveraging on‑device intelligence.<br/>
<br/>
watchOS 26 debuts a refreshed Workout app layout and introduces Workout Buddy, an AI fitness coach that uses voice guidance to mark milestones, deliver stats, and celebrate records. The Apple Watch can now suggest workout music, and the Smart Stack UI adapts more intelligently. A wrist‑flick gesture dismisses notifications, and notification volume auto‑adjusts. Plus, the Notes app makes its debut on watchOS.<br/>
<br/>
In visionOS 26, users can place widgets in physical space, and the system retains their position. A "Look to scroll" gesture enables more intuitive navigation, and users can now unlock iPhones via Vision Pro. The update introduces new customizable Personas and enhanced guest‑mode collaboration. New accessories such as the Logitech Muse (a 6‑DoF pen) and PlayStation VR2 Sense controllers are now supported.<br/>
<br/>
iPadOS 26 embraces macOS‑style windowing—full‑screen with resizable grab handles, traffic‑light controls, flick‑to‑tile window placement, and Exposé. A persistent menu bar and revamped pointer introduce desktop-like navigation. The Files app features customizable columns, default‑app settings per file type, folder personalization, and drag‑to‑Dock support. Apple adds a standalone Preview app and the Journal app (also now on macOS). Developers gain local audio‑input APIs, video‑call recording tools, and background‑task support.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-26/">macOS 26 Tahoe</a> adopts Liquid Glass throughout, introduces color‑and‑emoji folder customization, and brings support for Shortcut automations. Spotlight becomes a full‑featured launcher—complete with intelligent suggestions, inline app actions, Quick‑Key shortcuts, clipboard history, and developer App Intents integration. A new Applications experience replaces Launchpad.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/">Apple Intelligence</a> expands with developer access to its foundation model via a new API, supporting private, offline AI integration. <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/visual-intelligence/">Visual Intelligence</a> extends across screens, allowing direct in‑screenshot actions, while <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/image-playground/">Image Playground</a> gains support for ChatGPT image‑creation. Live Translation is built in for Messages, calls, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/facetime/">FaceTime</a> captions, and these tools are now accessible through developer APIs.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[If you <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/get-ios-26-developer-beta-iphone/">installed iOS 26 Beta or iPadOS 26 Beta</a> through Apple's Developer Program or Software Beta Program, you may decide you want to downgrade because of usability or stability issues. Keep reading to learn how it's done.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/06/iOS-26-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1005033" /><br/>
Apple's beta versions of its major software updates can be notoriously buggy, especially the early releases. You may find apps not working properly, poor battery life, device crashes, and features that don't do what they're supposed to. Fortunately, you can restore your iPhone or iPad to the previous version of iOS.<br/>
<br/>
If you made an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/get-ios-26-developer-beta-iphone/#backup">archived backup</a> before you installed the iOS 26 beta, you can remove the ‌beta and restore the backup. If you didn't make a backup, you can still downgrade, but you won't be able to restore your device to its original state before you upgraded.<br/>
<br/>
Also, bear in mind that if you've installed watchOS 26 on your Apple Watch, you won't be able to use it with your ‌iPhone‌ once you've gone back to iOS 18. And downgrading an Apple Watch to a previous version of watchOS can't be done manually either – if you want to remove ‌watchOS 26, you'll have to send your watch in to Apple.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>How to Downgrade From iOS 26 Beta or iPadOS 26 Beta</h2><br/>
<ol><li>Launch <strong>Finder</strong> on your Mac (or iTunes on Windows PCs.)</li><br/>
<li>Connect your iPhone or iPad to your computer using a Lightning or USB-C cable.</li><br/>
<li>Put your device into recovery mode. The method of doing this depends on your device, so check the list below these steps to find your model. Apple also provides more information on Recovery mode in <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201263">this support article</a>.<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/06/restore-ios-device.jpg" alt="restore" width="1990" height="1092" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-748305" /><br/>
<li>A dialog will pop up asking if you want to restore your device. Click <strong>Restore</strong> to wipe your device and install the latest public release of iOS or iPadOS.</li><br/>
<li>Wait while the restore process completes. </li></ol><br/>
<h2>How to Enter Recovery Mode on Your iOS Device</h2><br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Valve has quietly released a <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/SteamClientBeta/announcements/detail/545611272206420782">Steam Client Beta</a> that runs natively on Apple Silicon, finally ending its reliance on the Rosetta 2 translation layer.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/02/steam-apple-logo.jpg" alt="" width="2560" height="1440" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-784620" /><br/>
The updated Steam client eliminates the performance overhead that plagued Mac gamers since Apple's transition to its own chips. Steam's Chromium-based interface, which could slow to a crawl on occasion, now runs directly on Apple Silicon rather than through Intel emulation.<br/>
<br/>
Early testers report dramatically faster launch times and smoother navigation through the Store and Library. The difference should be immediately apparent, with basic actions like switching tabs feeling fluid rather than laggy.<br/>
<br/>
Apple announced this week at WWDC that macOS Tahoe will be the last version supporting Intel Macs, with Rosetta 2 set for deprecation. Starting with macOS 28, Apple said that only a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/10/apple-to-phase-out-rosetta-2/">limited version of Rosetta 2 will remain available</a> for older games that rely on Intel-based frameworks<br/>
<br/>
Mac users can access the beta through Steam's settings. Navigate to Interface, select "Steam Beta Update" from the Client Beta Participation dropdown, then restart to download the roughly 230MB update.<br/>
<br/>
You can verify the native version is running by checking Activity Monitor – Steam should appear with "Kind: Apple" rather than "Kind: Intel."<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/13/steam-beta-adds-native-apple-silicon-support/">Steam Beta Adds Native Apple Silicon Support for Mac</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/steam-beta-adds-native-apple-silicon-support-for-mac.2458925/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's Passwords app is getting a handy new feature in iOS 26 and macOS Tahoe that should eliminate a particularly frustrating password management scenario.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/06/passwords-app-macos-tahoe.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1006017" /><br/>
The Passwords app now saves complete version history for stored logins that have been changed, which could be a lifesaver if you find yourself in a situation where a password gets accidentally overwritten.<br/>
<br/>
Users will find a new "View History" button when opening any login that has multiple saved versions. The history display shows each different password iteration, creation timestamps, and an option to clear the stored versions.<br/>
<br/>
Apple launched the standalone Passwords app in iOS 18, iPadOS 18, and macOS Sequoia after years of burying password management tools within the Settings app, and the version history addition is a nice refinement in iOS 26, iPadOS 26, and MacOS Tahoe.<br/>
<br/>
The update should prove particularly valuable for users managing frequently-changing credentials or situations where you update a password on a website and something causes the new credentials to not register properly.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/13/apples-passwords-app-gains-version-history-feature/">Apple&#039;s Passwords App Gains Version History Feature</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apples-passwords-app-gains-version-history-feature.2458923/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>
