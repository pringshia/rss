		<description><![CDATA[Apple co-founder and former CEO Steve Jobs was born on February 24, 1955, so today would have marked his 69th birthday had he not <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2011/10/05/steve-jobs-has-passed-away/">passed away in 2011</a> at the age of 56.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/06/steve-jobs-holding-iphone-4.jpg" alt="" width="1599" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-745029" /><br/>
Jobs and Steve Wozniak founded Apple in 1976 to produce the very first Apple computers, revolutionizing the personal computer and building up to one of the most famous commercial launches in history, the Macintosh, in 1984. He was ousted from the company just a year later, but returned in 1997 as a floundering Apple purchased Jobs' follow-up company NeXT to serve as the future basis of the Mac operating system. <br/>
<br/>
Apple was reinvigorated with Jobs back at the helm and Jony Ive leading a team generating iconic design after iconic design. The duo oversaw not only a rebirth of the Mac but the creation of a number of other revolutionary products and services, most notably including the iPod and of course the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>. Under Jobs' leadership from 1997 until his 2011 death from cancer, Apple went from a company on the brink of failure to one of the biggest tech companies in the world.<br/>
<br/>
As he always does, Apple CEO <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tim-cook/">Tim Cook</a> paid tribute to Jobs on Twitter today.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Thinking of my friend Steve on his birthday — the lives he touched, the vision he shared, and the profound impact he had on our world. “We’re here to put a dent in the universe.

		<description><![CDATA[The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/">iPhone 16 Pro</a> is set to succeed 2023's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a>, introducing <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone-15-pro-vs-iphone-16-pro/">over 25 new features</a> and improvements to Apple's high-end smartphones. With many users adopting two-year upgrade cycles, plenty of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-14/">iPhone 14</a> Pro owners will be looking to upgrade to the &zwnj;iPhone 16 Pro&zwnj; later this year, so this guide breaks down every major difference you should be aware of between the two generations based on rumors. <br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/iPhone-14-Pro-vs-16-Pro-Feature-2.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-937778" /></div><br/>
In 2022, Apple unveiled the &zwnj;iPhone 14&zwnj; Pro as the successor to the popular <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-13/">iPhone 13</a> Pro, introducing an always-on display, the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/dynamic-island/">Dynamic Island</a>, a 48-megapixel camera, the A16 Bionic chip, longer battery life, and more. Two years later, the &zwnj;iPhone 16 Pro&zwnj; is expected to offer over 50 upgrades. All of the changes the &zwnj;iPhone 16 Pro&zwnj; models are expected to feature compared to their 2022 predecessor are listed below, using information from reliable sources that we have <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/">previously covered</a>. We will update this article as more rumors emerge in the coming months.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="design">Design</h2><br/>
The design of the &zwnj;iPhone 16 Pro&zwnj; is expected to be a relatively significant evolution over the &zwnj;iPhone 14&zwnj; Pro, iterating on the titanium frame and slightly rounded edges introduced on the &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; models last year. <br/>
<br/>
<table class="comparison"><br/>

<div class="clear"></div><br/>
<br/>
<h3 id="dimensions">Dimensions</h3><br/>
To accommodate larger displays, both &zwnj;iPhone 16 Pro&zwnj; models are rumored to grow in height and width. In addition to last year's increase in depth, the devices are due to be considerably larger, but with a notable reduction in weight thanks to the adoption of a titanium frame. <br/>
<br/>

<h2 id="displays">Displays</h2><br/>
Both &zwnj;iPhone 16 Pro&zwnj; models are expected to feature larger displays than their predecessors, pushing the &zwnj;iPhone 16 Pro&zwnj; Max to be the biggest <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> ever offered. There are also reportedly improvements to the underlying OLED technology in store, in addition to last year's slimmer bezels, making for a noticeable overall display upgrade.<br/>

The &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; was a fairly significant upgrade over the &zwnj;iPhone 14&zwnj; Pro in 2023, introducing a titanium chassis, slimmer bezels, the Action button, and a USB-C port. The &zwnj;iPhone 16 Pro&zwnj; will build on these upgrades, offering larger displays, the Capture button, and improved cameras. With over 50 upgrades likely to be in store, many &zwnj;iPhone 14&zwnj; Pro users will find upgrading to an &zwnj;iPhone 16 Pro&zwnj; model worthwhile.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/">iPhone 16 Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99">iPhone</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone-14-pro-vs-iphone-16-pro/">iPhone 14 Pro vs. iPhone 16 Pro: 50+ Upgrades to Expect</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-14-pro-vs-iphone-16-pro-50-upgrades-to-expect.2420302/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This week saw the surprise release of a new Apple Sports app for tracking sports scores across a number of leagues, while we learned more about features coming soon in iOS 17.4.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/top-stories-24feb2024.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-937909" /><br/>
We also saw more rumors about AirPods updates coming later this year, and Apple's latest MacBook Pro models have hit Apple's refurbished products store at a nice discount, so read on for all the details on these stories and more!<br/>
<br/>
<h2>'Apple Sports' App Announced With Personalized Scoreboards and More</h2><br/>
Apple this week <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/21/apple-sports-app-announced/">released a new Apple Sports app for the iPhone</a> that shows scores, stats, standings, upcoming games, betting odds, and more for a variety of leagues, such as the MLB, MLS, NBA, NHL, Premier League, and the NFL when its next season begins. For ongoing games, the app also displays real-time play-by-play information.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/Apple-Sports-App-Preview-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="1961" height="1102" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-937385" /><br/>
We <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/21/apple-sports-app-hands-on/">went hands-on with the app</a>, which has a very basic interface with scoreboards you can personalize by following your favorite teams and leagues. In an interview, Apple's services chief and noted sports enthusiast <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/21/apple-sports-app-simplicity/">Eddy Cue said the app's simple design is intentional</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Apple Sports is available for free on the App Store in the U.S., the U.K., and Canada, and is compatible with iOS 17.2 and later.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Apple Announces 'Groundbreaking' New Security Protocol for iMessage</h2><br/>
Apple this week <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/21/apple-announces-imessage-security-upgrade/">announced a new post-quantum cryptographic protocol for iMessage</a> called PQ3. Apple says this "groundbreaking" and "state-of-the-art" protocol provides "extensive defenses against even highly sophisticated quantum attacks."<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/07/General-Apps-Messages.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1407" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-808613" /><br/>
PQ3 will be gradually rolling out for supported iMessage conversations starting with iOS 17.4, iPadOS 17.4, macOS 14.4, and watchOS 10.4. Apple believes this new protocol's protections "surpass those in all other widely deployed messaging apps."<br/>
<br/>
<h2>iOS 17.4 Lets You See Your iPhone 15 Battery Health at a Glance</h2><br/>
The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/20/apple-seeds-ios-17-4-beta-4-to-developers/">fourth beta of iOS 17.4</a> seeded to developers and public beta testers this week includes some changes to the battery menu in the Settings app.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/ios-17-4-battery-health-optimization-iphone-15.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-937223" /><br/>
The menu now <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/20/ios-17-4-iphone-15-battery/">shows you whether your iPhone's battery health is "normal"</a> at a glance, and shows the battery's cycle count. This information was already accessible elsewhere in iOS, but now it is in one convenient place starting with iOS 17.4, which will be released in March.<br/>
<br/>
Apple also <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/20/apple-raises-iphone-15-advertised-battery-lifespan/">increased the advertised battery lifespans of all iPhone 15 models</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>10 Hidden Messages Features in iOS 17</h2><br/>
iOS 17 was released around five months ago, but there are <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/10-hidden-messages-features-in-ios-17/">some hidden features and functions in the Messages app</a> that you still might not be familiar with.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/07/iOS-17-Messages-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2250" height="1266" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-903379" /><br/>
We recently shared a list of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/10-hidden-messages-features-in-ios-17/">10 hidden Messages app features on iOS 17</a>. For example, did you know that you can hold the plus sign next to the typing field to quickly access your iPhone's photo library?<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Apple Now Selling Refurbished M3 Pro and M3 Max MacBook Pro Models</h2><br/>
Apple this week began selling <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/19/refurbished-m3-pro-m3-max-macbook-pro/">certified refurbished models of the 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro with M3 Pro and M3 Max chips</a> for the first time since the laptops launched in November.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/m3-macbook-pro-14-16.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-937044" /><br/>
As usual for Apple's refurbished products, prices are discounted by approximately 15% compared to the equivalent brand new models. In our view, Apple's refurbished products are virtually indistinguishable from its brand new products, providing a good opportunity for savings.<br/>
<br/>
Check out our <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/best-apple-deals/">Apple Deals roundup</a> for more discounts on Macs and other devices.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>AirPods 4 and AirPods Max With USB-C Still Expected Later This Year</h2><br/>
Apple plans to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/19/new-airpods-later-this-year-rumor/">release fourth-generation AirPods and updated AirPods Max later this year</a>, according to <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/Airpods-Max-Feature-Red-Triad.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-936395" /><br/>
Gurman said there will be two types of fourth-generation AirPods, with the higher-end ones to feature active noise cancellation and a speaker built into the USB-C charging case for Find My sounds.<br/>
<br/>
As for the AirPods Max, the only notable change expected is a USB-C charging port.<br/>

		<title>Apple Explored These Notch and Dynamic Island Designs for iPhones</title>

		<category>Dynamic Island</category>
		

		<description><![CDATA[With the iPhone 14 Pro models in 2022, Apple introduced the Dynamic Island, which can morph and expand to display system alerts, sports scores, and a variety of other information. The feature makes the space surrounding the front camera and Face ID sensors useful compared to the notch on older iPhone models.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/iPhone-Notch.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-938010" /><br/>
Apple explored a variety of ideas for the iPhone's notch area over the years before arriving at the current Dynamic Island design, according to information obtained by <em>MacRumors</em>. We recreated the images below based on our source material to provide a never-before-seen look at some of the concepts that Apple considered.<br/>
<br/>
Before the Dynamic Island, Apple explored a popover menu on the right side of the screen that would have provided users with quick access to the time, cellular signal and Wi-Fi strength, display brightness, volume, and battery charge level. The menu essentially looks like a second notch, and it would disappear when not in use.<br/>
<br/>
Another idea that Apple considered was hiding the notch with an all-black status bar area at the top of the screen. OLED displays show the color black by turning off individual pixels, so this design would have contributed to battery life savings.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/Alternate-Notch-Design-Mock-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="3750" height="2109" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-937933" /><br/>
Apple later came up with the idea of the Dynamic Island, and it explored a variety of different designs for this, as pictured below. <br/>
<br/>
Apple initially made the Dynamic Island permanently elongated across the top of the screen, before deciding that it would be less intrusive if it changed size as necessary. Apple also considered showing volume and a full row of system shortcuts in the Dynamic Island, tested a never-used layout for ongoing phone calls, and more.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/Alternate-Dynamic-Island-Design-Mock-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-937932" /><br/>
Apple has since expanded the Dynamic Island to all iPhone 15 models, while it continues to sell the iPhone 13, iPhone 14, and iPhone 14 Plus with a notch. Rumors suggest that Apple eventually plans to move the iPhone's front camera and Face ID sensors under the display, but this transition is not expected to begin <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/03/under-display-face-id-to-debut-on-iphone-17-pro/">until next year at the earliest</a>.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/dynamic-island/">Dynamic Island</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/23/iphone-notch-and-dynamic-island-designs/">Apple Explored These Notch and Dynamic Island Designs for iPhones</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-explored-these-notch-and-dynamic-island-designs-for-iphones.2420258/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today added the 14-inch MacBook Pro with the M3 chip to its certified refurbished store <a href="https://www.apple.com/ca/shop/refurbished/mac/macbook-pro">in Canada</a> and select European countries, including <a href="https://www.apple.com/at/shop/refurbished/mac/macbook-pro">Austria</a>, <a href="https://www.apple.com/be-nl/shop/refurbished/mac/macbook-pro">Belgium</a>, <a href="https://www.apple.com/fr/shop/refurbished/mac/macbook-pro">France</a>, <a href="https://www.apple.com/de/shop/refurbished/mac/macbook-pro">Germany</a>, <a href="https://www.apple.com/ie/shop/refurbished/mac/macbook-pro">Ireland</a>, <a href="https://www.apple.com/it/shop/refurbished/mac/macbook-pro">Italy</a>, <a href="https://www.apple.com/nl/shop/refurbished/mac/macbook-pro">the Netherlands</a>, <a href="https://www.apple.com/es/shop/refurbished/mac/macbook-pro">Spain</a>, <a href="https://www.apple.com/ch-de/shop/refurbished/mac/macbook-pro">Switzerland</a>, and <a href="https://www.apple.com/uk/shop/refurbished/mac/macbook-pro">the UK</a>, for the first time since the laptop debuted in October. Availability in the U.S. <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/07/apple-refurbished-14-inch-m3-macbook-pro/">began earlier this month</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/m3-mbp-space-black.jpg" alt="" width="1440" height="810" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-919466" /><br/>
As usual for Apple's refurbished products, the refurbished 14-inch MacBook Pro models are discounted by approximately 15% compared to the equivalent brand new models. A variety of configurations and color options are available.<br/>
<br/>
Apple says it puts refurbished Macs through a "thorough cleaning process and inspection" to ensure they are fully functional and in good condition, and they are covered by Apple's one-year limited warranty and eligible for extended AppleCare+ coverage. The laptops are repackaged in a plain white box with all accessories and manuals.<br/>
<br/>
In our view, Apple's refurbished Macs are virtually indistinguishable from brand new ones, providing a good opportunity for savings directly from Apple. However, larger discounts are often <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/best-apple-deals/">available from resellers like Amazon</a>.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro/">MacBook Pro 14 & 16" </a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-refurbished/">Apple Refurbished Products</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Pro_16">14" & 16" MacBook Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macbook-pro.90">MacBook Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/23/refurbished-m3-macbook-pro-canada-europe/">Apple Begins Selling Refurbished 14-Inch MacBook Pro With M3 Chip in Canada and Europe</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-begins-selling-refurbished-14-inch-macbook-pro-with-m3-chip-in-canada-and-europe.2420249/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple has been beta testing iOS 17.4 for nearly a month now. Below, we explain when the update is likely to be released to all users.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/iOS-17.4-Feature-Blue.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-932462" /><br/>
In its press release announcing <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/26/iphone-changes-coming-to-eu-users/">major App Store changes in the EU</a>, which were implemented in response to new regulations under the EU's Digital Markets Act, Apple confirmed that iOS 17.4 will be released at some point in March:<blockquote>Developers can learn about these changes on the Apple Developer Support page and can begin testing new capabilities today in the iOS 17.4 beta. The new capabilities will become available to users in the 27 EU countries beginning in March 2024.</blockquote>Apple has until March 6 to comply with the Digital Markets Act, in order to avoid fines, so iOS 17.4 will likely be released on or before that date.<br/>
<br/>
In addition to the changes in the EU, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ios-17-4-beta-features/">key new features in iOS 17.4</a> include Apple Podcasts transcripts, a new iMessage security protocol, new emoji, and the ability to use the Apple Cash card on more websites by generating a virtual card number. The update also includes preparations for the launch of next-generation CarPlay later this year.<br/>
<br/>
iOS 17.4 is compatible with the iPhone XS and newer. The update will be available in the Settings app under General → Software Update.<br/>
<br/>
Other software updates expected to be released in March include iPadOS 17.4, macOS 14.4, watchOS 10.4, tvOS 17.4, and visionOS 1.1. <div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-17/">iPadOS 17</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-17.241">iOS 17</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-17.242">iPadOS 17</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/23/ios-17-4-release-date/">When Will Apple Release iOS 17.4 for iPhones?</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/when-will-apple-release-ios-17-4-for-iphones.2420243/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple often holds its first media event of the year in March, so the company could be just weeks away from announcing new products.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/New-Macs-iPads-iOS-17-4.jpg" alt="" width="3198" height="1798" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-936049" /><br/>
Below, we have outlined what to expect from a potential Apple Event this March. <br/>
<br/>
<h2>Past Apple Events in March</h2><br/>
Apple has held five events in March since 2015:<ul><li>Monday, March 9, 2015</li><br/>
<li>Monday, March 21, 2016</li><br/>
<li>Tuesday, March 27, 2018</li><br/>
<li>Monday, March 25, 2019</li><br/>
<li>Tuesday, March 8, 2022</li></ul><h2>iOS 17.4 in March</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/iOS-17.4-Feature-Blue.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-932462" /><br/>
In its <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2024/01/apple-announces-changes-to-ios-safari-and-the-app-store-in-the-european-union/">press release</a> announcing <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/26/iphone-changes-coming-to-eu-users/">major App Store changes in the EU</a>, in response to the Digital Markets Act, Apple confirmed that iOS 17.4 will be released in March:<blockquote>Developers can learn about these changes on the Apple Developer Support page and can begin testing new capabilities today in the iOS 17.4 beta. The new capabilities will become available to users in the 27 EU countries beginning in March 2024.</blockquote>Apple has until March 6 to comply with the Digital Markets Act in order to avoid fines, so iOS 17.4 will likely be released before then.<br/>
<br/>
In addition to the changes in the EU, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ios-17-4-beta-features/">key new features in iOS 17.4</a> include Apple Podcasts transcripts, a new iMessage security protocol, new emoji, and the ability to use the Apple Cash card on more websites by generating a virtual card number. The update also includes preparations for the launch of next-generation CarPlay later this year.<br/>
<br/>
Other software updates expected to be released in March include iPadOS 17.4, macOS 14.4, watchOS 10.4, tvOS 17.4, and visionOS 1.1. <br/>
<br/>
<h2>Rumored Announcements</h2><br/>
<h3>New iPads With Aluminum Magic Keyboard</h3><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/iPad-Air-12.9-Inch-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2192" height="1233" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-917813" /><br/>
Apple will likely launch new iPad Pro and iPad Air models "<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/28/gurman-new-ipads-and-macs-in-late-march/">around the end of March</a>," according to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-01-28/apple-eu-changes-sideloading-third-party-app-stores-are-future-of-the-iphone-lrxjzbg6"><em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman</a>.<br/>
<br/>
The next iPad Pro models are widely expected to be the first iPads equipped with brighter and more vivid OLED displays. Other rumored or likely features for the iPad Pro include the M3 chip, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/18/ipad-pro-magsafe-charging/">MagSafe wireless charging</a>, a redesigned Magic Keyboard with a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/03/gurman-new-ipad-magic-keyboard-to-feature-aluminum/">larger trackpad and an aluminum top casing</a>, and a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/25/ipad-pro-landscape-face-id-camera/">landscape-oriented front camera</a>.<br/>
<br/>
A <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/10/12-9-inch-ipad-air-display-shipments/">larger 12.9-inch iPad Air</a> is expected alongside an updated 10.9-inch model. Other rumored or likely features for the iPad Air include the M2 chip, a redesigned rear camera bump, Wi-Fi 6E support, and Bluetooth 5.3.<br/>
<br/>
Could the second-generation Apple Pencil recently going on sale for a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/17/amazon-apple-pencil-2-low-price/">record-low price</a> hint at a third-generation Apple Pencil announcement too?<br/>
<br/>
<h3>New MacBook Airs</h3><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/MacBook-Air-15-Inch-Feature-Purple.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="894" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-898576" /><br/>
Gurman also expects Apple to announce new MacBook Airs in late March.<br/>
<br/>
The 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Air are expected to be updated with the M3 chip simultaneously, with key benefits over the M2 chip including faster performance and hardware-accelerated ray tracing for improved graphics rendering in games.<br/>
<br/>
No major design changes are expected for the MacBook Air this year, but the laptops will likely gain support for Wi-Fi 6E like other Macs.<br/>
<br/>
Apple already updated the 14-inch MacBook Pro, 16-inch MacBook Pro, and 24-inch iMac with the M3 chip in October 2023.<br/>
<br/>
<h3>New iPhone Color?</h3><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/03/iPhone-14-Yellow-Feature-2.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-887956" /><br/>
Apple often introduces new iPhone colors around March or April, midway through the smartphone's annual release cycle.<br/>
<br/>
<ul><li><strong>March 2023:</strong> Apple made the iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/07/apple-announces-yellow-iphone-14/">available in Yellow</a>.</li><br/>
<li><strong>March 2022:</strong> Apple introduced a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/03/08/apple-unveils-new-iphone-13-green-and-iphone-13-pro-alpine-green-colors/">new Green color for the iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 mini</a>, and a new Alpine Green color for the iPhone 13 Pro models.</li><br/>
<li><strong>April 2021:</strong> Apple made the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/20/apple-launching-iphone-12-in-new-purple-color-on-april-30/">iPhone 12 and iPhone 12 mini available in Purple</a>.</li></ul>Will the new color this year <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/29/iphone-15-productred-possibility/">be (PRODUCT)RED</a>?<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/23/what-to-expect-at-apple-event-march-2024/">What to Expect at Potential Apple Event in March: iPads, Macs, and More</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/what-to-expect-at-potential-apple-event-in-march-ipads-macs-and-more.2420234/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Belkin recently came out with the Auto-Tracking Stand Pro for capturing video, and while there are several other similar products with video tracking on the market, we thought we'd test Belkin's because it brings something new - support for DockKit.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe title="Belkin Auto Tracking Stand Pro" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wj5o8tHCXZM" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe><em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/macrumors?sub_confirmation=1">Subscribe to the MacRumors YouTube channel</a> for more videos.</em></div><br/>
DockKit is a feature that provides automated subject tracking technology through the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> itself, which means the Stand Pro is the most advanced of the movement tracking stands on the market. Note that the Stand Pro is only for capturing video - it doesn't work with still photos.<br/>
<br/>
The Stand Pro can follow you on camera as you move around a room, offering 360 degrees of panning and 90 degrees of tilting for video calls and recording content. It is compatible with both the front and rear cameras of the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; and can be used in either vertical or landscape orientation.<br/>
<br/>
The Stand Pro requires an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 12 or later with <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe-battery-pack/">MagSafe</a>, because it uses a magnetic attachment to hold the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; in place. Pairing to an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; is done through NFC, and then the Stand Pro can be used with any app that needs the camera. It works with <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/facetime/">FaceTime</a>, Instagram, TikTok, WhatsApp, and more, and turning it on and off is as simple as pushing the single button on the device.<br/>
<br/>
With a built-in battery, the Stand Pro can work for up to five hours so it can be used anywhere. When it is plugged in, it can charge a &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; at up to 15W. Belkin includes a five foot USB-C cable and 30W power adapter.<br/>
<br/>
The Auto-Tracking Stand Pro is <a href="https://www.belkin.com/auto-tracking-stand-pro-with-dockkit/P-MMA008.html">available from Belkin</a> for &#36;180.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/belkin/">Belkin</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/23/belkin-stand-pro-hands-on/">Testing Belkin&#039;s Auto-Tracking Stand Pro With DockKit</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/testing-belkins-auto-tracking-stand-pro-with-dockkit.2420228/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[<strong>Update — 10:09 a.m. Pacific Time:</strong> Apple says the App Store showing an app verification screen in the EU is a bug and will be fixed before iOS 17.4 is released to all users. Original story follows.<br/>
<br/>
Starting with the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/20/apple-seeds-ios-17-4-beta-4-to-developers/">latest iOS 17.4 beta</a>, Apple asks iPhone users in the EU to verify an app's information before installing it from the App Store. The prompt was spotted by <a href="https://twitter.com/iSWUpdates/status/1761031633774190980">Dimitris Sartzetakis of @iSWUpdates</a> and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/iOSBeta/comments/1avtztu/ios_17_db4_if_an_app_is_installed_via_spotlight/">others</a>. <br/>
<br/>

iOS 17.4 will allow iPhone users in the EU to install apps from <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/19/iphone-changes-coming-to-eu-users/">so-called "alternative app marketplaces,"</a> and the verification screen will appear in those storefronts too. Apple is likely aiming to avoid anticompetitive complaints by also showing the prompt in its own App Store, should it remain in the public release of iOS 17.4.<br/>
<br/>
Apple previously announced that iOS 17.4 will be <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/04/ios-17-4-new-features-and-changes/">released in March</a>, and the App Store changes only apply in the <a href="https://european-union.europa.eu/easy-read_en">27 countries</a> that are part of the EU, including France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and others.

		<description><![CDATA[A small number of Apple Vision Pro owners have claimed that their headsets developed a hairline crack down the middle of the front cover glass, despite having never been dropped or mishandled.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/cracked-glass-vision-pro.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-937762" /><div class="center-wrap"><em>Photo of hairline crack in Vision Pro front glass (credit: Reddit user <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/VisionPro/comments/1axc3bo/sudden_random_crack_in_the_front_glass/">Inphenite</a>)</em></div><br/>
The first report was posted in the subreddit /r/VisionPro about <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/VisionPro/comments/1ajl51r/3_days_in_and_we_have_a_crack_on_the_outer_glass/">18 days ago</a>, and <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/VisionPro/comments/1axj5sp/woke_up_today_with_a_crack_down_the_front_middle/kror2jt/">several more have appeared</a> in the last week. All of the images show a distinctly similar vertical hairline crack above the nose bridge, implying that the damage is occurring at a particular point of tension, where the curvature of the laminated glass is most pronounced.  <br/>
<br/>
We were unable to find additional similar reports on social media, on Apple's online Support Community, or in the <em>MacRumors</em> forums, suggesting that this is quite possibly a manufacturing defect limited to a small batch of units, rather than a widespread problem.<br/>
<br/>
The reports all mention that the crack became visible suddenly and for no apparent reason, after the headsets had been connected to the external battery pack and stored overnight (some in Apple's Travel Case) with the soft front cover attached. <br/>
<br/>
One theory is that the crack is due to pressure exerted on the glass when tightening the straps, which is causing "bowing" of the surrounding frame. Others speculate that the problem may be due to an overheating issue which is expanding the glass and leading it to crack at its weakest point. Given that the battery is external to the headset, any heat generated would presumably need to be caused by a background software process gone haywire.  <br/>
<br/>
Apple's documentation <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/117740">states</a> that Apple Vision Pro continues to draw power from the battery pack when it is not in use, allowing the device to sync mail, photos, and other data. If the headset isn't worn for 24 hours, Vision Pro powers down automatically.<br/>
<br/>
With AppleCare, the deductible fee for a <a href="https://support.apple.com/apple-vision-pro/repair">cover glass repair</a> costs &#36;300. Without AppleCare coverage, the same repair costs &#36;800. Some of the owners affected say they have contacted Apple Support and have been asked to pay the repair costs, since the crack has not officially been identified as a manufacturing defect.<br/>
<br/>
Apple typically introduces special repair programs for products that have a recognized hardware issue, but Apple is unlikely to undertake an internal manufacturing probe unless reports of identical defects become more widespread. Anyone with the same issue is advised to contact <a href="https://getsupport.apple.com/topics">Apple Support</a> and escalate their case to increase the likelihood that Apple sees a potential problem requiring a formal investigation.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AppleVisionPro">Vision Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-vision-pro.209">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/23/apple-vision-pro-front-glass-cracked-reports/">Handful of Apple Vision Pro Units Develop Identical Crack in Cover Glass</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/handful-of-apple-vision-pro-units-develop-identical-crack-in-cover-glass.2420222/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple is relying on different OLED display suppliers for the upcoming 11-inch and 13-inch <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a> models, with Samsung exclusively producing 11-inch panels and LG making the 13-inch panels. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/07/iPad-Pro-OLED-Feature-2.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-853666" /><br/>
According to <em><a href="https://www.thelec.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=26128">The Elec</a></em>, Samsung has cemented its position as the sole supplier of the initial quantity of OLED displays for the 11-inch model, or the first batch to be mass produced for the launch of the next-generation &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj;. <br/>
<br/>
LG was originally scheduled to also begin producing the 11-inch OLED panel, but as things stand the two panel companies are currently producing only one type of OLED display each. Initial production at both suppliers <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/16/oled-ipad-displays-enter-production/">started last month</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Industry insiders suggest the division of labor is due to changes in Apple's demand outlook for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/oled-ipad-pro/">OLED iPad Pro</a> models, as well as the unstable production capacity and yield of the two suppliers, which are both still getting to grips with Apple's requirement for new panel technologies. Apple is rumored to be aiming for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/07/12/oled-ipad-lightweight-design-and-image-quality/">"unrivaled" image quality</a>, as well as a design that cuts down on the thickness and weight of the ‌<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>‌ display.<br/>
<br/>
According to the Korean-language report, the situation may change after production of the initial quantity, depending on fluctuations in production yield and possible adjustments to Apple's demand forecast for the new &zwnj;OLED &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; Pro&zwnj; models. Apple's shipments forecast for the year have <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/25/apple-planning-to-sell-fewer-oled-ipad-pros/">reportedly</a> decreased to 8 million units, down from the 10 million units that were projected for 2024 last year. <br/>
<br/>
OLED displays are a first for the ‌&zwnj;iPad&zwnj;‌ lineup. Apple has been using OLED technology for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> and the Apple Watch, but larger OLED screens are more expensive. Compared to LED or mini-LED, OLED brings deeper blacks and more vivid colors. The OLED ‌&zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj;‌ models could be <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/20/upcoming-oled-ipad-pro-thinner/">much thinner</a> than the current LED versions thanks to the new display technology. The larger 12.9-inch ‌&zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj;‌, for example, could be more than 1mm thinner.<br/>
<br/>
Along with new displays, the ‌&zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj;‌ models are expected to be powered by Apple's latest M3 chip, which debuted in new MacBook Pro models last year. The M3 is built on 3-nanometer technology, and should bring a notable graphics improvement over the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m2/">M2</a> chip that is currently used in the ‌&zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj;‌. <br/>

The new displays are expected to come to the &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/28/gurman-new-ipads-and-macs-in-late-march/">as soon as March 2024</a>.

		<description><![CDATA[Apple is internally testing a new ChatGPT-like generative AI tool that will enable employees to offer faster technical support going forward.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/08/Apple-Support-App-General-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2250" height="1266" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-908138" /><br/>
Apple recently launched a pilot program that provides select AppleCare support advisors with access to a new tool called "Ask" that can automatically generate responses to technical questions they receive from customers, according to information obtained by <em>MacRumors</em>. Advisors can then relay the info to customers in online chats or on the phone.<br/>
<br/>
"Ask" will automatically respond to a query with relevant information from Apple's internal knowledge base, and advisors can rate an answer as "helpful" or "unhelpful." Advisors can ask up to five follow-up questions per topic. Apple said it plans to make the tool available to more advisors in the future, after collecting feedback.<br/>
<br/>
Apple encourages participating advisors to use "Ask" before using traditional search methods or consulting a senior advisor for info, and it says the tool is useful for solving complex or unfamiliar issues. As the tool is linked to Apple's internal knowledge base, the company ensures that the responses are factual, traceable, and useful.<br/>
<br/>
An example of a query that "Ask" can respond to: "A customer is unable to update their device to iOS 13.7. What can be done?"<br/>
<br/>
Apple is expected to adopt generative AI in a major way this year. <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman said <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/16/ios-18-slew-of-new-ai-features/">iOS 18 will include many new generative AI features</a> across Siri, Spotlight, Messages, Health, Numbers, Pages, Keynote, and more, and he was first to report that the AppleCare team would use generative AI to speed up customer support. This is the first time that details about Apple's internal "Ask" tool have been reported.<br/>
<br/>
On an earnings call earlier this month, Apple CEO Tim Cook said the company was working on generative AI and would <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/01/apple-ai-details-coming-later-this-year/">share details "later this year."</a> iOS 18 is expected to be announced at Apple's annual developers conference WWDC in June, and the update should be released to all users with a compatible iPhone in September.<br/>
<br/>
Generative AI surged in popularity in late 2022 when OpenAI released <a href="https://openai.com/chatgpt">ChatGPT</a>, a chatbot that can respond to text and voice prompts. The chatbot is trained on large language models, allowing it to respond like a human. OpenAI has also developed tools that can automatically generate <a href="https://openai.com/dall-e-3">images</a> and <a href="https://openai.com/sora">videos</a> based on text prompts.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/applecare/">AppleCare</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/22/applecare-advisors-testing-new-ask-tool/">AppleCare Support Advisors Testing New ChatGPT-Like Tool &#039;Ask&#039;</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/applecare-support-advisors-testing-new-chatgpt-like-tool-ask.2420196/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Some <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a> users have been experiencing ongoing Bluetooth connection issues that have persisted since the new devices launched, based on complaints on the <a href="https://discussions.apple.com/thread/255184161?sortBy=best&amp;page=42">Apple Support Community</a> and the <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/bluetooth-problems-with-older-devices.2416344/"><em>MacRumors</em> forums</a>.<br/>

Affected customers are having trouble keeping their iPhones connected to older Bluetooth devices such as in-car systems or headphones that rely on the technology. From <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/bluetooth-problems-with-older-devices.2416344/post-32854348">the <em>MacRumors</em> forums</a>:<br/>
<blockquote>Since ios 17 I have been having frequent disconnects in my car (no carplay. BMW 2014) bluetooth for calls. I make a hands free call in my car and after a few seconds bluetooth disconnects and I have manually switch to the speaker in my Iphone. I have had this car since new and I switch iphones almost every year and usually the release x.0 has some bluetooth problems, but now 2 major releases for ios 17 and the issue is not solved. Another iphone 12 does not have the problem in my car.</blockquote><br/>
Many of the complaints come from &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; users who are attempting to connect their iPhones to Bluetooth headphones, car systems, and similar devices, but some users are <a href="https://discussions.apple.com/thread/255184161?answerId=259967295022&sortBy=best#259967295022">also experiencing issues</a> with more modern products like the AirPods.<br/>
<blockquote>I moved from 15 plus to 15 pro max (silly but switched carriers so I got it for free) and am having terrible bluetooth connections. Car bluetooth is fine. But on both my AirPods Max and and Beats Studio Buds, my music will cut out and reconnect and calls will drop after 5 to 10 minutes. Done all the resets. Hoping we are sent a software update soon.</blockquote><br/>
Reports of Bluetooth issues date back to October 2023, which is just a month after the &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; models were released. They have continued across multiple updates, with the most recent reports coming from those running iOS 17.3.1. Some customers were told that the problems would be resolved with an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a> update, but based on the continuing complaints, it does not appear that Apple has fully resolved the issue as of yet.<br/>
<br/>
The cause of the problem is not clear, but affected users have both &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a> models. Some people have been able to get their iPhones replaced, which has been the only way to solve the issue. Restarting, resetting, and other typical fixes have not worked for those who are having problems.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[In the months leading up to Apple announcing the AirPods Pro in October 2019, the company considered changing the name of the wireless headphones to AirPods Extreme, according to internal information obtained by <em>MacRumors</em>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/09/airpods-pro-2.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-862208" /><br/>
The name AirPods Extreme was floated by at least one member of Apple's leadership team, but the company ultimately decided to move forward with AirPods Pro branding after many employees objected to the change, we have learned.<br/>
<br/>
Apple has used "Extreme" branding in the past for its discontinued AirPort Extreme router and wireless card for Macs, first released in 2003.<br/>
<br/>
In the end, the name AirPods Pro is more consistent with Apple's branding for several product lines. In addition to AirPods, Apple offers both regular and Pro versions of the iPhone, iPad, and Mac, and there will likely be a regular version of the Apple Vision Pro headset in the future. Nevertheless, Apple has used a few other suffixes for higher-end products over the years, such as the AirPods Max and the Apple Watch Ultra.<br/>
<br/>
Apple went on to release second-generation AirPods Pro in September 2022, and it updated the headphones with a USB-C charging case and a few other features a year later. Third-generation AirPods Pro are rumored to be released in 2025.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/">AirPods Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AirPods-Pro">AirPods Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/airpods.216">AirPods</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/22/airpods-pro-were-almost-named-airpods-extreme/">AirPods Pro Were Almost Named AirPods Extreme</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/airpods-pro-were-almost-named-airpods-extreme.2420187/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Readdle <a href="https://sparkmailapp.com/blog">today announced the launch</a> of a new "My Writing Style" artificial intelligence feature created for the <a href="https://sparkmailapp.com">Spark email app</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/spark-my-writing-style.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-937595" /><br/>
Spark already had an option for using AI to write emails in different styles like formal, neutral, and friendly, but the updated AI option is designed to write emails in each user's own voice. According to Readdle, it is able to mirror style, tone, and personality traits "to a degree."<br/>
<br/>
Users can enable Spark AI in the Spark Settings, and from there, the app will select three samples of recently sent emails to analyze writing style. This style will then be applied to AI-generated emails and replies.<br/>
<br/>
AI-generated text can be edited and reviewed before it is sent, and there is an option to disable the feature for those who do not want to use it. Spark suggests that the tool is useful for journalists, content creators, researchers, academics, and professional teams.<br/>
<br/>
Readdle recommends providing simple prompts to the AI to get the best results, such as "write an intro email to Bob and suggest setting up a call at 10:00 a.m. tomorrow."<br/>
<br/>
<a href="https://sparkmailapp.com">Spark's AI tool</a> uses Microsoft Azure OpenAI as its AI service provider, and it says that data is not used for model training nor stored for more than a month. Spark Premium is required to use the feature, with the Premium update priced at &#36;7.99 per month or &#36;59.99 per year.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/spark/">Spark</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/artificial-intelligence/">Artificial Intelligence</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/22/spark-mail-ai-writing-assistant/">Spark Mail Gets &#039;My Writing Style&#039; AI Email Assistant</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/spark-mail-gets-my-writing-style-ai-email-assistant.2420185/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<title>Apple Says Spotify Wants &#039;Limitless Access&#039; to App Store Tools Without Paying</title>

		<description><![CDATA[Amid rumors that the European Commission <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/19/apple-fined-500-million-eu-music-probe/">will soon fine Apple</a> 500 million euros for breaking EU law over access to streaming music services, Apple today commented on its relationship with <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/">Apple Music</a> competitor Spotify and the ongoing complaints that Spotify has made to the EC to attempt to get the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a> rules changed.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-801789" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/06/Apple-vs-Spotify-feature2.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" /><br/>
In a statement to <em>MacRumors</em>, Apple said that Spotify is aiming to get unlimited access to Apple's tools and services without paying anything for the value that Spotify receives from the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj;.<blockquote>"We're happy to support the success of all developers -- including Spotify, which is the largest music streaming app in the world. Spotify pays Apple nothing for the services that have helped them build, update, and share their app with Apple users in 160 countries spanning the globe. Fundamentally, their complaint is about trying to get limitless access to all of Apple's tools without paying anything for the value Apple provides."</blockquote>The European Union's investigation into the streaming music market and Apple's &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; policies was initially sparked by Spotify. Spotify has complained multiple times about the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; rules that prevent it from allowing users to subscribe to Spotify without using in-app purchases and without paying a fee to Apple. <br/>
<br/>
Spotify began working with the European Commission in 2015, and the company filed a final complaint in Europe in 2019. That led to a Statement of Objections from the European Commission in 2021. After that, the European Commission filed a "replacement" Statement of Objections on two separate occasions as it narrowed the focus of its investigation, with the latest statement released in December 2023. Over the last 10 years, Spotify met with the European Commission 65 times in an attempt to convince the EU that Apple's rules negatively impact streaming music services. <br/>
<br/>
Apple says that while Spotify has claimed that Apple policies were harming competition and stifling growth, the streaming music market was in reality growing, presenting a challenge to the European Commission and leading to the revisions in the Statement of Objections. The commission was not able to pursue Apple for requiring app developers to use in-app purchase nor did it find that Apple was harming consumers with anti-competitive practices, so the investigation shifted to the anti-circumvention rules that prevent apps from informing users about lower subscription prices available outside of the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj;. <br/>
<br/>
According to Apple, Spotify wants to rewrite the rules for its own gain. Apple does not believe that Spotify's complaints are about competition or finding a better deal for consumers -- it says Spotify simply wants a better deal and is using the European Commission to try to get it. Spotify wants access to Apple's technology, &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; reach, and to monetize through the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; without paying anything to Apple.<br/>
<br/>
The European Commission has said that Apple's anti-circumvention rules are "detrimental to users of music streaming services on Apple's mobile devices" and could lead to confusion for consumers that results in higher prices, but it is Apple's opinion that the European Commission's view on this point is misguided and has been heavily influenced by Spotify's ongoing complaints. <br/>
<br/>
Apple says that Spotify is the dominant streaming music provider in Europe and other countries, and that much of the company's success can be attributed to the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj;. Spotify's apps are able to work seamlessly across Apple devices because of Apple's engineering efforts. Spotify has used TestFlight for almost 500 versions of its app, and it uses thousands of Apple's APIs across 60 frameworks.<br/>
<br/>
If and when the EU fines Apple over this matter, the company will almost certainly appeal the decision, so the antitrust battle between Apple and Spotify is likely far from over. <br/>
<br/>
<b>Update:</b> In a statement, Spotify said it does not have a level playing field with Apple and trusts that the European Commission will take action to create a fair ecosystem.<blockquote>Spotify’s success has happened despite Apple's best efforts to gain an artificial advantage by favoring their own music service at every turn while placing roadblocks and imposing unfair restrictions on ours. Under their current rules Apple controls Spotify’s access to its own customers and gives Spotify one of two untenable options: We either have to deliver a poor user experience where we can’t directly communicate how to buy or subscribe to Spotify on iPhones or we have to accept a 30% cost disadvantage against our biggest competitor. This is not a level playing field. We support the European Commission and trust that they will take action soon to create a fair ecosystem for everyone involved.</blockquote><br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Google today announced the launch of a new "Help me Write" feature that is available for the Chrome browser on both Macs and Windows PCs. It is a tool that is able to help users start writing something, or refine something that's already been written.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/google-help-me-write-example-1.jpg" alt="" width="1581" height="889" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-937562" /><br/>
Help me Write uses the Gemini model that Google announced back in December. At the time, Google said that Gemini was its most capable and general model to date, created through large-scale collaborative efforts by teams across Google.<br/>
<br/>
According to Google, the Help me Write feature can be used for everything from online reviews to support requests to product listings. The AI model is able to understand the context of the webpage that the user is on to provide suggestions for relevant content.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/google-help-me-write-example-2.jpg" alt="" width="1533" height="862" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-937563" /><br/>
As an example, a person writing a review for a pair of shoes might see suggestions that include key features from the product page that support the user's opinion to make a review more valuable. For an online listing of something that's being sold on eBay or another site, users can write a quick outline and have the Help me Write feature provide a more well-written summary. The same goes for online support inquiries.<br/>
<br/>
Help me Write is available in Chrome M122, and it can be used in the United States in English. The feature can be enabled by signing into Chrome, selecting the Settings option from the three-dot menu, and navigating to the Experimental AI page. To use it, right click on any open text field in Chrome and choose the Help me Write option.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/google/">Google</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/chrome/">Chrome</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/22/google-chrome-mac-help-me-write-ai/">Chrome for Mac Gains &#039;Help Me Write&#039; Generative AI Feature</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/chrome-for-mac-gains-help-me-write-generative-ai-feature.2420158/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>
