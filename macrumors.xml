		<description><![CDATA[Samsung kicked off a <a href="https://howl.me/clq2oxlzaSU">new sale on computer monitors</a> this week, including a match of the all-time low price on the 27-inch ViewFinity S9 5K Smart Monitor. You can get this display for <a href="https://howl.me/clq17ynFNDS"><strong>&#36;999.99</strong></a> on Samsung's website, down from &#36;1,599.99. <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FSAMSUNG-Thunderbolt-DisplayPort-Slimfit-Camera-LS27C900PANXZA%2Fdp%2FB0CB71BY87%3Fth%3D1">Amazon is matching this sale</a>.<br/>

When you click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment, which helps us keep the site running.</small></em><br/>
<br/>
This is a massive &#36;600 discount on the Smart Monitor, which features a matte 5K display, modular 4K SlimFit camera, and support for Thunderbolt 4. The monitor is a good (and cheaper) alternative to Apple's Studio Display. The last time we tracked this deal was about one month ago, so if you've been waiting for a solid markdown on the Samsung display, now is definitely the time to buy.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a>'s rumored AI features could revive faltering <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> sales in China, according to <a href="https://www.digitimes.com/news/a20240223PD204.html"><em>DigiTimes</em></a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/iOS-18-Mock-Siri-Feature-Baubles.jpg" alt="" width="2250" height="1266" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-909208" /><br/>
In a paywalled report, <em><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/digitimes-com/">DigiTimes</a></em> explains that despite the Chinese market pivoting toward high-end devices, &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; sales have reportedly struggled since the start of 2024 in the region against rival brands offering generative AI features and foldable displays.<br/>
<br/>
In December 2023, Apple reportedly saw a 13% decline in revenue in China, following months as the top smartphone brand in the country by shipments, and there have been further reports of even more severe declines of up to 40% in recent weeks. Chinese consumers apparently see Apple's diminutive selection of AI features as contradictory to its image as a pioneering brand. <br/>
<br/>
<em>&zwnj;DigiTimes&zwnj;</em> reiterated <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/16/ios-18-slew-of-new-ai-features/">previous rumors</a> suggesting that &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj; will contain a number of new AI features, but cautioned that Apple needs to make significant progress in the AI space to meet consumer expectations and revive the company's popularity in China amid fierce competition from brands like Huawei, which are heavily investing in AI research and development. <br/>
<br/>
On an earnings call earlier this year, Apple CEO <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tim-cook/">Tim Cook</a> said the company was working on generative AI and would <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/01/apple-ai-details-coming-later-this-year/">share details "later this year."</a> Apple is expected to preview &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj; at its annual developers conference WWDC in June, and the update should be released in September. Some new AI features could be exclusive to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a> models later in the year, with the lineup rumored to get a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/14/iphone-16-upgraded-neural-engine-rumor/">"significantly" upgraded Neural Engine</a>.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/china/">China</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/digitimes-com/">DigiTimes</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/26/ios-18-could-revive-iphone-sales-in-china/">iOS 18&#039;s AI Features Could Revive iPhone Sales in China</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-18s-ai-features-could-revive-iphone-sales-in-china.2420448/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Some game developers are dissatisfied with <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-arcade/">Apple Arcade</a> amid concerns about the subscription service's future, a new report claims. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2019/12/applearcade.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="606" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-723048" /><br/>
Sources speaking to <a href="https://mobilegamer.biz/inside-apple-arcade-axed-games-declining-payouts-disillusioned-studios-and-an-uncertain-future/"><em>mobilegamer.biz</em></a> described a "smell of death" around  Apple's games subscription service and noted the difference between the company's investment in TV and music, and its interest in games. "At the very top of the company there needs to be a passion and respect for games, and there just isn't," one developer said. "It all depends on how much buy-in there is from those guys at the top, and I don't think they really value Arcade or invest in it the same way you see them invest in music or TV."<br/>
<br/>
The service initially touted generous upfront payments to developers. Most games released on &zwnj;Apple Arcade&zwnj; in the service's first few years were apparently profitable, providing a lifeline for studios. "Despite its imperfections, we're very very happy Arcade exists. It has made premium games viable on mobile," one games studio executive said, explaining that their company would not exist without Apple's support.<br/>
<br/>
The report claims that &zwnj;Apple Arcade&zwnj;'s payouts to developers have been falling for several years, noticeably starting in October 2020. Both upfront payments and the per-play "bonus pool" have shrunk, and Apple is said to be evasive about how these sums are calculated. "They have this opaque metric that they call a qualifying session, and bonus pool payments are made based on that," one source said. "But no-one knows what a qualifying session actually is – it has something to do with if the game was launched, how long the player played for and how often they return. But it's a black box, really."<br/>
<br/>
"<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a> Greats" are not eligible for upfront payments, receiving bonus pool contributions only. As a result, games with shorter narratives and premium indie titles earn less than games with longer-term retention. This apparently explains the slow loss of certain types of games on the service. Moreover, there has apparently been a strong shift toward prominent family-friendly IP in Apple's commissioning decisions, with one or two new "&zwnj;App Store&zwnj; Greats" per month. Very few original games are greenlit for the service unless they meet these requirements.<br/>
<br/>
While some developers spoke about their relationship positively, others described the company as "vindictive" or "spiteful" in its dealings. Some developers claim that the &zwnj;Apple Arcade&zwnj; team has not made its strategy shift and overall direction clear, and often simply stops replying to emails. "I got the sense they didn't really know where they were going with it all – almost like they weren't sure if they'd have jobs at the end of it," one studio representative said.<br/>
<br/>
Developers similarly spoke about their difficulties getting marketing support or obtaining features on the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj;, even when their games are struggling to get traction on &zwnj;Apple Arcade&zwnj;. "We have to basically beg for featuring from Apple. Getting that banner featuring at the top is like squeezing blood from a stone," one developer added.<br/>
<br/>
Apple "rebooted" the subscription service in April 2021, cancelling a large number of projects. Some developers believe that Netflix's competitive move into gaming subscriptions has prompted Apple to consider another &zwnj;Apple Arcade&zwnj; reboot, but the long-term future of the service is unclear.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-arcade/">Apple Arcade</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/26/developers-describe-apple-arcade-smell-of-death/">Game Developers Describe &#039;Smell of Death&#039; Around Apple Arcade</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/game-developers-describe-smell-of-death-around-apple-arcade.2420447/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<title>Apple&#039;s Decision to Disable Web Apps Attracts Scrutiny in EU</title>

		<description><![CDATA[The European Commission is considering investigating Apple's move to disable <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/home-screen/">Home Screen</a> web apps in the EU, the <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/d2f7328c-5851-4f16-8f8d-93f0098b6adc"><em>Financial Times</em></a> reports.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2016/01/European-Commisssion.jpg" alt="" width="1080" height="719" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-484620" /><br/>
Following the release of the second beta version of iOS 17.4, it emerged that Apple had <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/08/ios-17-4-nerfs-web-apps-in-the-eu/">restricted the functionality of iOS web apps in the EU</a>. Web apps can no longer launch from the &zwnj;Home Screen&zwnj; in their own top-level window that takes up the entire screen, relegating them to a simple shortcut with an option to open within Safari instead. Critics argue that the move undermines the role of web apps as viable alternatives to native apps in iOS.<br/>
<br/>
EU competition regulators sent questions to developers last week to determine the impact of the change in what is apparently seen as a precursor to an in-depth probe. The European Commission confirmed its scrutiny to the <em>Financial Times</em>: <blockquote>We are indeed looking at the compliance packages of all gatekeepers, including Apple. In that context, we're in particular looking into the issue of progressive web apps, and can confirm sending the requests for information to Apple and to app developers, who can provide useful information for our assessment.</blockquote><br/>
<br/>
Apple claims that <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/15/ios-17-4-web-apps-removed-apple/">it had to make the change to how web apps work</a> in iOS to comply with the EU's Digital Markets Act (DMA), arguing that third-party browsers used with web apps in Europe could expose users to unlawful security and privacy risks. It believes that the adjustments will only affect a small number of users.<br/>
<br/>
A potential probe into web apps could come after the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/19/iphone-changes-coming-to-eu-users/">March 6 deadline</a> for Apple to comply with the DMA, but formal proceedings could be prevented if Apple makes further concessions.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/european-union/">European Union</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/antitrust/">Apple Antitrust</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/26/disabled-web-apps-attract-eu-scrutiny/">Apple&#039;s Decision to Disable Web Apps Attracts Scrutiny in EU</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apples-decision-to-disable-web-apps-attracts-scrutiny-in-eu.2420446/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's &#36;59 FineWoven cases for iPhone 15 <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/21/apples-finewoven-iphone-cases-poor-reviews/">took heavy flak</a> when they were released last September for being subpar compared to the leather Apple cases they replaced. Now, <em>The Wall Street Journal</em> columnist Joanna Stern has distilled customers' ire by <a href="https://x.com/JoannaStern/status/1761072266639458745">sharing</a> her own experience with the case after five months of use.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/finewoven-case-stern.jpeg" alt="" width="3000" height="1999" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-938281" /><div class="center-wrap"><em>Image credit: Joanna Stern</em></div><br/>
From <a href="https://techthings.cmail20.com/t/d-e-eosyk-irijhkzjj-r/">Stern's newsletter</a>:<br/>
<blockquote>There it is, everyone. My iPhone 15 Pro Max's FineWoven case after five months of use. The edges are peeling, the fabric is scratched up like an old CD and it's browning like a rotten banana. I've been waiting for the CDC to show up at my house to declare it a biomedical concern.<br/>
Some of you will say: "JOANNA! How gross are you?" Others—those who bought this case for &#36;59 when it came out in September—will likely say: "Yep. Same issues here."<br/>
<br/>
[...]<br/>
<br/>
Early on, tech news sites like <a href="https://techthings.createsend1.com/t/d-l-eosyk-irijhkzjj-t/">The Verge</a> complained about scratches in the fabric. At online retailers, the people who gave the case one or two stars all point out the same issues—peeling edges, scratches, proclivity to get dirty. <a href="https://techthings.createsend1.com/t/d-l-eosyk-irijhkzjj-i/">On Best Buy</a>, many say they'll never buy an Apple case again and that it’s the worst product Apple's ever made. <a href="https://techthings.createsend1.com/t/d-l-eosyk-irijhkzjj-d/">Same on Amazon</a>.<br/>
<br/>
An Apple spokesman said that the company's cases are engineered at the highest standard to protect iPhones and that the FineWoven case's durable microtwill will protect an iPhone for years.</blockquote>An <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204172">Apple support document</a> offers advice about cleaning its FineWoven cases, but the section's small print admits that "The material may look different and show wear over time as the fibers get compressed with normal use" and that "some scratches may diminish over time."<br/>
<br/>
Responding to Stern's five-month review, <em>Daring Fireball</em>'s John Gruber created <a href="https://twitter.com/gruber/status/1761517510111695133">identical polls</a> across multiple social media platforms asking FineWoven case owners for their opinion, and respondents appear to have overwhelmingly voted in agreement that "It's a piece of junk."<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">If you own an Apple FineWoven iPhone case and have used it regularly for the last few months:<a href="https://t.co/4XQ7cu7nlB">https://t.co/4XQ7cu7nlB</a></p>&mdash; John Gruber (@gruber) <a href="https://twitter.com/gruber/status/1761517510111695133">February 24, 2024</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div><br/>
Despite the continued bad publicity almost six months on from the cases' debut, Apple still appears unwilling to admit that its leather alternative material is a letdown. But in the court of public opinion, all the evidence suggests this is an open and shut case: FineWoven is just bad. <div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/finewoven/">FineWoven</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/26/finewoven-iphone-cases-brown-like-rotten-banana/">Not-So-FineWoven iPhone Case &#039;Browning Like a Rotten Banana&#039;</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/not-so-finewoven-iphone-case-browning-like-a-rotten-banana.2420436/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple plans to expand the iPhone 15 Pro Max's tetraprism camera with up to 5x optical zoom to both the iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max this year, according to Taiwanese research firm TrendForce. This is a rumor we have heard from other sources before, including <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/18/iphone-16-pro-tetraprism-lens-rumor/">Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/20/tetraprism-lens-iphone-16-pro/">our own reporting</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/iPhone-16-Cameras-Feature-1.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-919420" /><br/>
TrendForce briefly mentioned this information today <a href="https://www.trendforce.com/presscenter/news/20240226-12042.html">in a press release</a> focused on the overall smartphone camera lens market:<blockquote>Following the successful launch of the iPhone 15 Pro Max with its exclusive Tetraprism telephoto zoom lens, the industry is expected to see an increase in the adoption of periscopic lens modules. Apple plans to bring this advanced hardware upgrade to the iPhone 16 Pro, making it accessible to more users in the Pro series.</blockquote>In the iPhone 15 Pro Max, the tetraprism camera system has a "folded" design that allows it to fit inside the smartphone, enabling <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/12/iphone-15-pro-max-25x-digital-zoom/">up to 5x optical zoom and up to 25x digital zoom</a>. By comparison, the smaller iPhone 15 Pro remains limited to up to 3x optical zoom, in line with the iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max.<br/>

It has been rumored that the iPhone 16 Pro will feature a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/08/iphone-16-pro-larger-display-sizes/">larger 6.3-inch display</a>, compared to the 6.1-inch iPhone 15 Pro. This change would increase the overall size of the device, which could provide additional internal space for a tetraprism camera.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Microsoft repeatedly attempted to persuade Apple to switch to Bing as the default search engine for Safari or even buy it outright, it has emerged.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/02/microsoft-bing-chatgpt.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-884498" /><br/>
The information was disclosed in <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.223205/gov.uscourts.dcd.223205.835.0.pdf">documents</a> as part of Google's ongoing antitrust case against the U.S. Justice Department (via <em><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/02/24/google-says-microsoft-offered-to-sell-bing-to-apple-in-2018.html">CNBC</a></em>). According to the filings, Microsoft approached Apple in 2009, 2013, 2015, 2016, 2018, and 2020, proposing that Bing should replace Google as the default search engine in Safari.<br/>
<br/>
Apple consistently declined these offers, citing concerns over Bing's search quality relative to Google's. The documents reveal that in 2018 Microsoft not only suggested making Bing the default search engine but also offered to sell Bing to Apple or establish a joint venture around the search engine. These proposals were similarly turned down by Apple.<br/>
<br/>
The court filings provide insight into Apple's decision-making process, highlighting the company's evaluation of Bing's capabilities against Google's. <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/eddy-cue/">Eddy Cue</a>, Apple's Senior Vice President of Services, is quoted in the filings expressing skepticism about Bing's search quality and Microsoft's investment in search technology. <br/>
<br/>
<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2020/10/25/google-apple-search-default-8-12-billion/">Google pays billions of dollars</a> to remain the default search engine on Apple devices.

		<description><![CDATA[As part of its <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-gpt/">generative AI push</a>, Apple is expected to feature tight integration between <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a> and the Messages app in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a>. We won't have a fuller idea about how that will work until Apple previews its next major software update at WWDC in June, but in the meantime, Google has just <a href="https://blog.google/products/android/new-android-features-february-2024/">announced</a> its own equivalent feature for Android.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/gemini-google-messages.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-938245" /><br/>
In an update for the beta version of Google Messages arriving this week, users will be able to interact with Google's Gemini chatbot (previously called "Bard") right inside the app, where it can help to draft messages, brainstorm ideas, plan events, or simply allow for a "fun conversation." Google says the feature is only available to English-language Messages users for now.<br/>
<br/>
Android Auto is also getting an AI assistant that can automatically summarize long texts or busy group chats while users are driving. It will also suggest relevant replies and actions that users can tap once to send a message, share their ETA, or start a call. We have not heard rumors mention AI in relation to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/carplay/">CarPlay</a>, so whether or not Apple has similar features in the works is unknown.<br/>
<br/>
&zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj; and iPadOS 18 will include a "slew of new AI features," according to a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/16/ios-18-slew-of-new-ai-features/">recent report</a> by <em>Bloomberg</em>'s <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a>. The report claims Apple is training both &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; and Spotlight search on large language models, with the goal of improving each feature's ability to answer complex questions accurately. The revamped version of Spotlight could also offer deeper integration with "specific" functions and features in apps.<br/>
<br/>
Gurman says that one of the tentpole AI features Apple is developing is an improved interaction between &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; and the Messages app, which would let &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; auto-complete sentences more effectively and answer complex questions. Apple has also explored AI-powered features that would allow users to automatically generate playlists in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/">Apple Music</a> and presentation slides in the Keynote app. Some new AI features announced later on in the year could well be exclusive to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a> models, which are rumored to get a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/14/iphone-16-upgraded-neural-engine-rumor/">"significantly" upgraded Neural Engine</a>.<br/>
<br/>
According to the latest data from TF International Securities, Apple's weekly smartphone sales in the Chinese market have declined by 30-40% in recent weeks, which is said to be partly due to rival Chinese smartphones <a href="https://www.digitimes.com/news/a20240223PD204/apple-ai-ios-china-smartphone-iphone-sales.html">already offering generative AI features</a> of their own.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/google/">Google</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-gpt/">Apple GPT</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/26/siri-generative-ai-google-gemini-messages/">Would You Let Siri Help to Write Your Messages?</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/would-you-let-siri-help-to-write-your-messages.2420429/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Starting at &#36;3,500, Apple's Vision Pro price puts it at the top-end of the AR/VR headset market, but a significant portion of the cost is down to the device's premium "bill of materials," which is thought to come in at just over &#36;1,500.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/Making-Vision-Pro.jpeg" alt="" width="1280" height="720" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-931759" /><br/>
According to <a href="https://omdia.tech.informa.com/blogs/2023/jul/oledos-and-oled-displays-will-account-for-35-of-apples-vision-pro-vr-device-component-costs">Omdia's research</a>, the components used in Vision Pro are estimated to cost Apple a total of &#36;1,542. The most expensive component is said to be the two 1.25-inch micro-OLED displays inside the headset, one for each eye. The displays provide a total of 23 million pixels, which Apple says is "more pixels than a 4K TV." Omdia estimates that Apple pays &#36;228 for each display, or &#36;456 per headset. <br/>
<br/>
The second most expensive components are the M2 and R1 chips. The M2 is the main processor, which is the same chip that was first introduced in the 2022 MacBook Air. The M2 is responsible for processing content, running the visionOS operating system, executing computer vision algorithms, and providing graphical content. The R1 chip is responsible for all of the information coming from the cameras, sensors, and microphones. Together they cost Apple a total of &#36;240.<br/>
<br/>
As noted by <em><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/02/24/apples-vision-pro-why-its-so-expensive.html">CNBC</a></em>, it is hard to extrapolate Apple's profit margin from these estimated figures, since they do not take into account research and development costs, packaging, shipping, sales, marketing, and any capital expenditures that can add up-front costs to large parts orders. Nevertheless, they do give an idea of how expensive the parts alone are in a given device.<br/>
<br/>
Apple is expected to produce fewer than 400,000 Vision Pro headsets in 2024 due to the complexity of manufacturing, according to analyst Ming-Chi Kuo. However, Apple is said to be already working on a new version of the Apple Vision Pro that will be priced more affordably. The chips in the device are likely to be on par with the iPhone rather than Mac-level chips, and Apple may also use lower resolution internal displays and cheaper materials. It could also drop the outward-facing EyeSight feature that lets other people see a simulated rendering of the wearer's eyes.<br/>
<br/>
<em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman believes that Apple is working on a next-generation version of the Vision Pro that could see a launch <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/19/gurman-apple-vision-pro-2-at-least-18-months-away/">sometime in late 2025</a>.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AppleVisionPro">Vision Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-vision-pro.209">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/26/price-apple-pays-to-make-vision-pro-headset/">Here&#039;s How Much It Costs Apple to Make a Vision Pro Headset</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/heres-how-much-it-costs-apple-to-make-a-vision-pro-headset.2420426/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[AT&T has <a href="https://www.att.com/makeitright/">announced</a> that it will be providing impacted customers with a &#36;5 bill credit per account as compensation for the network's major outage across the U.S. on Thursday. The credits will automatically be applied within two bill cycles, it said.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/ATT-Banner.jpeg" alt="" width="1200" height="630" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-937556" /><br/>
AT&T said the bill credit offer does not apply to AT&T Business, prepaid, or Cricket customers. A spokesperson for the carrier <a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/at-t-will-give-5-account-credits-after-thursdays-network-outage/">told <em>CNET</em></a> that those customers will "have options available to them if they were potentially impacted by the outage."<br/>
<br/>
The carrier's full statement apologizing for the outage:<blockquote>We apologize for Thursday's network outage. We recognize the frustration this outage has caused and know we let many of our customers down. We understand this may have impacted their ability to connect with family, friends, and others. Small business owners may have been impacted, potentially disrupting an essential way they connect with customers.<br/>
<br/>
To help make it right, we're reaching out to potentially impacted customers and we're automatically applying a credit to their accounts. We want to reassure our customers of our commitment to reliably connect them – anytime and anywhere. We're crediting them for the average cost of a full day of service.<br/>
<br/>
We're also taking steps to prevent this from happening again in the future. Our priority is to continuously improve and be sure our customers stay connected.</blockquote>AT&T also <a href="https://about.att.com/ecms/dam/snrdocs/network-employee-letter.pdf">shared the letter</a> that its CEO John Stankey sent to the company's employees. In it, he said the company "let down" many of its customers and has "already implemented changes to prevent what happened on Thursday."<br/>
<br/>
<h2>'Incorrect Process'</h2><br/>
Based on its initial review, AT&T <a href="https://about.att.com/pages/network-update">said</a> it believed that the outage was caused by the "application and execution of an incorrect process used as we were expanding our network," not a cyber attack. The U.S. government on Thursday said the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security were looking into the outage.<br/>
<br/>
The outage began in the early hours of Thursday morning, with tens of thousands of customers complaining that they were unable to make cellular phone calls, send or receive text messages, or use cellular data. AT&T said about three-quarters of its customers were able to access its network by around 6 a.m. Eastern Time on Thursday, and it said that it had fully restored its network by around 1 p.m. Eastern Time that day.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/25/att-crediting-customers-for-network-outage/">AT&amp;T Giving &#36;5 Credit to Customers Following Major Network Outage</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/at-t-giving-5-credit-to-customers-following-major-network-outage.2420387/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[iOS 18 will likely include some design changes, but a macOS revamp might be a year or two away, according to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-02-25/apple-ponders-making-new-wearables-ai-glasses-airpods-with-cameras-smart-ring-lt1kb7cd"><em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman</a>.<br/>

In his <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-02-25/apple-ponders-making-new-wearables-ai-glasses-airpods-with-cameras-smart-ring-lt1kb7cd"><em>Power On</em> newsletter</a> today, Gurman said Apple is working to update the design of iOS as "early as this year." A sketchy rumor claimed that iOS 18 would feature some <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/09/ios-18-visionos-design-elements-rumor/">visionOS-inspired design elements</a>, and while Gurman agreed that iOS could take some design cues from visionOS, he does not expect a "total overhaul that mirrors visionOS."<br/>
<br/>
While he hedged with "as early as this year" wording today in regards to iOS design changes, Gurman was more firm about iOS 18 being redesigned in a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2023-11-12/apple-aapl-plans-ambitious-ios-18-and-macos-15-updates-seeks-to-squash-bugs-lovjlsf6">November edition</a> of his newsletter, when he said Apple's senior management had <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/13/apple-says-ios-18-ambitious-compelling/">described iOS 18 as "ambitious and compelling,"</a> with "major new features and designs."<br/>
<br/>
As for macOS, Gurman said Apple has started early work on design changes for that operating system that could debut in 2025 or 2026. The platform last received a major redesign with macOS Big Sur in 2020.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple has considered developing several new wearable devices over the years, including a smart ring for health and fitness, smart glasses, and upgraded AirPods with built-in cameras and more sensors, according to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-02-25/apple-ponders-making-new-wearables-ai-glasses-airpods-with-cameras-smart-ring-lt1kb7cd"><em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman</a>.<br/>

Below, we recap what Gurman shared about these devices in his <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-02-25/apple-ponders-making-new-wearables-ai-glasses-airpods-with-cameras-smart-ring-lt1kb7cd"><em>Power On</em> newsletter</a> today.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Smart Ring</h2><br/>
A few years ago, Apple's industrial design team presented the idea of a "smart ring" focused on health and fitness features to executives on the company's health team, according to Gurman. However, he said Apple is not actively developing the finger-worn device at this time, so it is unclear if it will ever be released.<br/>
<br/>
Gurman said the ring could be a lower-cost alternative to the Apple Watch that could sync health and fitness data with a paired iPhone. It would compete with products like the <a href="https://ouraring.com/">Oura Ring</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/20/apple-ring-allegedly-in-development/">Samsung's upcoming Galaxy Ring</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Smart Glasses</h2><br/>
It has long been rumored that Apple eventually hopes to release advanced AR glasses based on its Vision Pro headset. In the meantime, Gurman said the company has considered developing a "less ambitious" pair of smart glasses that would compete with the likes of Meta's Ray-Ban Smart Glasses and Amazon's Echo Frames.<br/>
<br/>
Apple has discussed creating glasses that would serve as an "AirPods replacement," with built-in speakers, cameras, health sensors, and AI capabilities, according to Gurman. The glasses are in a "technology investigation" stage within Apple's hardware engineering division, he said, so it sounds like a release is still far off. <br/>
<br/>
<h2>AirPods With Cameras</h2><br/>
Apple engineers last year started exploring how to fit low-resolution camera sensors into AirPods, according to Gurman. If ever released, he believes these AirPods could offer AI features that "assist people in their daily routines."<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/25/apple-has-explored-smart-ring-and-glasses/">Apple Has &#039;Explored&#039; a Smart Ring, Glasses, and AirPods With Cameras</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-has-explored-a-smart-ring-glasses-and-airpods-with-cameras.2420380/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple is still working on a new HomePod speaker with an "iPad-like display" built into it, but the device is unlikely to launch until 2025 at the earliest should the plans move forward, according to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-02-25/apple-ponders-making-new-wearables-ai-glasses-airpods-with-cameras-smart-ring-lt1kb7cd"><em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/04/HomePod-G4-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-793597" /><br/>
In his <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-02-25/apple-ponders-making-new-wearables-ai-glasses-airpods-with-cameras-smart-ring-lt1kb7cd"><em>Power On</em> newsletter</a> today, Gurman said Apple has started "early work" on a HomePod with a screen with overseas suppliers, but he said the company has yet to make "enough headway" on the device for him to consider a launch to be imminent.<br/>
<br/>
Gurman reiterated that Apple has also explored a device that <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/04/18/apple-work-on-apple-tv-homepod-continues/">combines an Apple TV, HomePod, and FaceTime camera</a>, along with iPad-like smart displays that could be magnetically attached to a wall, but it is unclear if these products will ever be released. He said Apple has been "indecisive" about its smart home product ideas for years.<br/>
<br/>
Apple reversed course and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/01/18/apple-announces-new-homepod/">released a new full-sized HomePod in 2023</a> after <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/12/apple-discontinuing-homepod/">discontinuing the device in 2021</a>.

		<description><![CDATA[Amazon this weekend has a pair of accessory deals on popular Apple products: the Apple Pencil 2 and AirTag 4 Pack. You can get the Apple Pencil 2 for the all-time low price of <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB07K1WWBJK%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"><strong>&#36;79.00</strong></a>, down from &#36;129.00, and the AirTag 4 Pack for <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0932QJ2JZ%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"><strong>&#36;78.00</strong></a>, down from &#36;99.00.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/03/apple-pencil-2-red.jpg" alt="" width="2250" height="1266" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-887463" /><em><small>Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with Amazon. When you click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment, which helps us keep the site running.</small></em><br/>
<br/>
In regards to the Apple Pencil 2, this is only the second time we've tracked this price in 2024, and it beats the low price we tracked during the holidays by about &#36;10. The Apple Pencil 2 is compatible with the following iPads: iPad mini (6th generation), iPad Air (4th generation and later), 12.9-inch iPad Pro (3rd generation and later), and 11-inch iPad Pro (1st generation and later). <br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB07K1WWBJK%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"target="_blank"><div class="fancybutton"><div class="fancybadge">&#36;50 OFF</div>Apple Pencil 2 for &#36;79.00</div></a></div><br/>
<br/>
If you have the newest iPad Pro models, the second-generation Apple Pencil can now be detected while hovering up to 12mm above the display. This allows users to see a preview of their drawing before they make it, and with Scribble text fields automatically expand when the pencil gets near the screen.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/06/airtag-new-orange.jpg" alt="" width="2250" height="1266" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-847828" /><br/>
Secondly, the AirTag 4 Pack is available for <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0932QJ2JZ%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"><strong>&#36;78.00</strong></a> today on Amazon, down from &#36;99.00. This is just about &#36;4 off from the previous all-time low price on the accessory, and right now it's only available on Amazon.<br/>
<br/>
If you just want one AirTag, Amazon also has the AirTag 1 Pack for <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0933BVK6T%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"><strong>&#36;24.00</strong></a>, down from &#36;29.00. This is another second-best price, and both models have an estimated delivery date around February 28.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0932QJ2JZ%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"target="_blank"><div class="fancybutton"><div class="fancybadge">&#36;21 OFF</div>AirTag 4 Pack for &#36;78.00</div></a></div><br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple co-founder and former CEO Steve Jobs was born on February 24, 1955, so today would have marked his 69th birthday had he not <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2011/10/05/steve-jobs-has-passed-away/">passed away in 2011</a> at the age of 56.<br/>

Jobs and Steve Wozniak founded Apple in 1976 to produce the very first Apple computers, revolutionizing the personal computer and building up to one of the most famous commercial launches in history, the Macintosh, in 1984. He was ousted from the company just a year later, but returned in 1997 as a floundering Apple purchased Jobs' follow-up company NeXT to serve as the future basis of the Mac operating system. <br/>
<br/>
Apple was reinvigorated with Jobs back at the helm and Jony Ive leading a team generating iconic design after iconic design. The duo oversaw not only a rebirth of the Mac but the creation of a number of other revolutionary products and services, most notably including the iPod and of course the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>. Under Jobs' leadership from 1997 until his 2011 death from cancer, Apple went from a company on the brink of failure to one of the biggest tech companies in the world.<br/>
<br/>
As he always does, Apple CEO <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tim-cook/">Tim Cook</a> paid tribute to Jobs on Twitter today.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/">iPhone 16 Pro</a> is set to succeed 2023's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a>, introducing <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone-15-pro-vs-iphone-16-pro/">over 25 new features</a> and improvements to Apple's high-end smartphones. With many users adopting two-year upgrade cycles, plenty of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-14/">iPhone 14</a> Pro owners will be looking to upgrade to the &zwnj;iPhone 16 Pro&zwnj; later this year, so this guide breaks down every major difference you should be aware of between the two generations based on rumors. <br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/iPhone-14-Pro-vs-16-Pro-Feature-2.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-937778" /></div><br/>
In 2022, Apple unveiled the &zwnj;iPhone 14&zwnj; Pro as the successor to the popular <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-13/">iPhone 13</a> Pro, introducing an always-on display, the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/dynamic-island/">Dynamic Island</a>, a 48-megapixel camera, the A16 Bionic chip, longer battery life, and more. Two years later, the &zwnj;iPhone 16 Pro&zwnj; is expected to offer over 50 upgrades. All of the changes the &zwnj;iPhone 16 Pro&zwnj; models are expected to feature compared to their 2022 predecessor are listed below, using information from reliable sources that we have <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/">previously covered</a>. We will update this article as more rumors emerge in the coming months.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="design">Design</h2><br/>
The design of the &zwnj;iPhone 16 Pro&zwnj; is expected to be a relatively significant evolution over the &zwnj;iPhone 14&zwnj; Pro, iterating on the titanium frame and slightly rounded edges introduced on the &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; models last year. <br/>
<br/>
<table class="comparison"><br/>

<div class="clear"></div><br/>

<h3 id="dimensions">Dimensions</h3><br/>
To accommodate larger displays, both &zwnj;iPhone 16 Pro&zwnj; models are rumored to grow in height and width. In addition to last year's increase in depth, the devices are due to be considerably larger, but with a notable reduction in weight thanks to the adoption of a titanium frame. <br/>

<h2 id="will_it_be_worth_upgrading">Will It Be Worth Upgrading?</h2><br/>
The &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; was a fairly significant upgrade over the &zwnj;iPhone 14&zwnj; Pro in 2023, introducing a titanium chassis, slimmer bezels, the Action button, and a USB-C port. The &zwnj;iPhone 16 Pro&zwnj; will build on these upgrades, offering larger displays, the Capture button, and improved cameras. With over 50 upgrades likely to be in store, many &zwnj;iPhone 14&zwnj; Pro users will find upgrading to an &zwnj;iPhone 16 Pro&zwnj; model worthwhile.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/">iPhone 16 Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99">iPhone</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone-14-pro-vs-iphone-16-pro/">iPhone 14 Pro vs. iPhone 16 Pro: 50+ Upgrades to Expect</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-14-pro-vs-iphone-16-pro-50-upgrades-to-expect.2420302/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

We <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/21/apple-sports-app-hands-on/">went hands-on with the app</a>, which has a very basic interface with scoreboards you can personalize by following your favorite teams and leagues. In an interview, Apple's services chief and noted sports enthusiast <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/21/apple-sports-app-simplicity/">Eddy Cue said the app's simple design is intentional</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Apple Sports is available for free on the App Store in the U.S., the U.K., and Canada, and is compatible with iOS 17.2 and later.<br/>

<h2>Apple Announces 'Groundbreaking' New Security Protocol for iMessage</h2><br/>
Apple this week <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/21/apple-announces-imessage-security-upgrade/">announced a new post-quantum cryptographic protocol for iMessage</a> called PQ3. Apple says this "groundbreaking" and "state-of-the-art" protocol provides "extensive defenses against even highly sophisticated quantum attacks."<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/07/General-Apps-Messages.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1407" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-808613" /><br/>
PQ3 will be gradually rolling out for supported iMessage conversations starting with iOS 17.4, iPadOS 17.4, macOS 14.4, and watchOS 10.4. Apple believes this new protocol's protections "surpass those in all other widely deployed messaging apps."<br/>

The menu now <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/20/ios-17-4-iphone-15-battery/">shows you whether your iPhone's battery health is "normal"</a> at a glance, and shows the battery's cycle count. This information was already accessible elsewhere in iOS, but now it is in one convenient place starting with iOS 17.4, which will be released in March.<br/>
<br/>
Apple also <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/20/apple-raises-iphone-15-advertised-battery-lifespan/">increased the advertised battery lifespans of all iPhone 15 models</a>.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[With the iPhone 14 Pro models in 2022, Apple introduced the Dynamic Island, which can morph and expand to display system alerts, sports scores, and a variety of other information. The feature makes the space surrounding the front camera and Face ID sensors useful compared to the notch on older iPhone models.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/iPhone-Notch.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-938010" /><br/>
Apple explored a variety of ideas for the iPhone's notch area over the years before arriving at the current Dynamic Island design, according to information obtained by <em>MacRumors</em>. We recreated the images below based on our source material to provide a never-before-seen look at some of the concepts that Apple considered.<br/>
<br/>
Before the Dynamic Island, Apple explored a popover menu on the right side of the screen that would have provided users with quick access to the time, cellular signal and Wi-Fi strength, display brightness, volume, and battery charge level. The menu essentially looks like a second notch, and it would disappear when not in use.<br/>
<br/>
Another idea that Apple considered was hiding the notch with an all-black status bar area at the top of the screen. OLED displays show the color black by turning off individual pixels, so this design would have contributed to battery life savings.<br/>
<br/>

Apple later came up with the idea of the Dynamic Island, and it explored a variety of different designs for this, as pictured below. <br/>
<br/>
Apple initially made the Dynamic Island permanently elongated across the top of the screen, before deciding that it would be less intrusive if it changed size as necessary. Apple also considered showing volume and a full row of system shortcuts in the Dynamic Island, tested a never-used layout for ongoing phone calls, and more.<br/>
<br/>

Apple has since expanded the Dynamic Island to all iPhone 15 models, while it continues to sell the iPhone 13, iPhone 14, and iPhone 14 Plus with a notch. Rumors suggest that Apple eventually plans to move the iPhone's front camera and Face ID sensors under the display, but this transition is not expected to begin <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/03/under-display-face-id-to-debut-on-iphone-17-pro/">until next year at the earliest</a>.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/dynamic-island/">Dynamic Island</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/23/iphone-notch-and-dynamic-island-designs/">Apple Explored These Notch and Dynamic Island Designs for iPhones</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-explored-these-notch-and-dynamic-island-designs-for-iphones.2420258/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>
