		<description><![CDATA[Apple is working on a new Home accessory that is designed to serve as a central hub or "Command Center" for smart home management. The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a> and the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod/">HomePod</a> are already home hubs and almost all Apple devices can control a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/homekit/">HomeKit</a> setup, but Apple is designing an all-in-one home management product to make control even easier.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/11/Apple-AI-Command-Center-Concept-Mock-5.png" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-978087" /><br/>
This guide aggregates everything that we know about Apple's smart home hub.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="design">Design</h2><br/>
Apple's upcoming smart home product will somewhat resemble an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>, and it will have an all-display design. It is expected to be square rather than rectangular, and it will measure in at six inches with thick bezels around the edges.<br/>
<br/>
In terms of size, it will look similar to two iPhones that are side-by-side, and it will be small and lightweight to allow it to be moved from room to room. The device will support touch input for opening apps and controlling connected devices.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/11/Apple-AI-Command-Center-Concept-Mock-3.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-978084" /><br/>
It will be able to be mounted on a wall, but Apple is also designing a dock that it can slot into that will let it sit on a table or desk. The desktop base could include additional speakers for playing music.<br/>
<br/>
<em>Bloomberg</em>'s <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a> has suggested that the smart home device will have a hemispherical base similar to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/">iMac</a> G4, with the small screen positioned at an angle on the base.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-832329" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/01/the-new-imac-g4-feature.jpg" alt="" width="1996" height="1122" /><em>The original &zwnj;iMac&zwnj; G4</em></div><br/>
Built-in speakers will be included, and it will have a camera on the front for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/facetime/">FaceTime</a> and video calls, along with a rechargeable battery. Apple is planning two colors, including silver and black.<br/>
<br/>
<h3 id="sensors">Sensors</h3><br/>
The smart home hub will be able to determine how close a person is standing to it, adjusting features from there. When no one is nearby, for example, it might show the temperature, but as someone approaches, it could shift to an interface for adjusting the thermostat.<br/>
<br/>
Person detection will likely allow it to be used in smart home automations for doing things like turning on the lights when someone enters a room. The sensor might be able to tell one person from another, and it could <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/26/apple-smart-home-accessory-square-display/">recognize hand gestures</a> for longer range control.<br/>
<br/>
Apple is also considering extra sensors that would plug into outlets throughout the home to interface with the hub, but it is not clear if these will be manufactured.<br/>
<br/>
<h3 id="chip">Chip</h3><br/>
Apple's upcoming smart home accessory is expected to use an A18 chip for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/">Apple Intelligence</a> support. Given that &zwnj;Apple Intelligence&zwnj; requires 8GB RAM minimum, it will have at least 8GB RAM.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="interface">Interface</h2><br/>
Apple does not plan to create a dedicated <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a> for the home hub, but it will come with several apps pre-installed. The main view will be a customizable home screen with widgets that can show the weather, important home controls, photo slideshows, upcoming events, and more.<br/>
<br/>
<em>Bloomberg</em>'s &zwnj;Mark Gurman&zwnj; has <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/12/apple-home-command-center-march-2025/">described the interface</a> as a mix between watchOS and the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>'s StandBy mode. A software-based dock will be available for launching various apps, and it will support <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Apple is planning to integrate &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; with &zwnj;Apple Intelligence&zwnj; for accessing and performing tasks in apps. By the time the device launches, the smarter version of &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; will be available, and will be able to control apps and tasks.<br/>
<br/>
There will be a focus on controlling smart home products and also security, with Apple providing alerts and camera footage from connected smart home cameras.<br/>
<br/>
<h3 id="apps">Apps</h3><br/>
Several Apple apps will be installed even though there won't be a dedicated &zwnj;App Store&zwnj;. Apps that are rumored:<br/>
<ul><br/>
 <li>Safari</li><br/>
 <li><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-news/">Apple News</a></li><br/>
 <li><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/">Apple Music</a></li><br/>
 <li>Notes</li><br/>
 <li>Calendar</li><br/>
 <li><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/photos/">Photos</a></li><br/>
 <li>Home</li><br/>
</ul><br/>
<br/>
<h3 id="intercom">Intercom</h3><br/>
More than one of the devices can be used throughout the home, and two or more can serve as room-to-room intercoms.<br/>
<br/>
<h3 id="airplay">AirPlay</h3><br/>
With its built-in speakers, the device will support music playback and it will be able to work as an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airplay/">AirPlay</a> receiver.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="future_smart_home_accessories">Future Smart Home Accessories</h2><br/>
Apple is reportedly considering creating its <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/12/apple-smart-home-products/">own line of smart home accessories</a> like an indoor security camera, but the company wants to see how the hub device does first. If that's successful, Apple could prioritize smart home products.<br/>
<br/>
Apple analyst <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/">Ming-Chi Kuo</a> thinks Apple is already working on a smart home camera that will be manufactured starting in 2026. Kuo says that Apple will sell "tens of millions" of these devices over the long term, with wireless connectivity and deep integration with &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; and &zwnj;Apple Intelligence&zwnj; planned.<br/>
<br/>
Apple could have an edge with security cameras because of its focus on privacy. Privacy would be a focus, providing an alternative to cameras from companies like Ring and Nest.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="pricing">Pricing</h2><br/>
It's not clear what Apple will price the device at, but Amazon's similarly sized Echo Show costs &#36;90. By keeping the display size small at six inches, Apple may be able to keep the price low and competitive with similar products.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="competition">Competition</h2><br/>
An Apple-designed smart home management product with an integrated display would compete with other smart home devices from companies like Facebook, Amazon, and Google. Facebook, for example, makes the Meta Portal, a device that can control Alexa-based products and that allows for video calls with friends and family.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-818290" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/09/echo-show.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" /><br/>
Amazon makes the Echo Show, a smart display with a speaker that comes in sizes up to 21 inches. It can be used for controlling smart home products, watching video, making calls, and more. Google offers the Nest Hub Max for streaming content, listening to music, and controlling products that integrate with the Google smart home system.<br/>
<br/>
With almost all of Apple's major competitors offering an in-home device that is designed to serve as a hub for controlling smart home products and making calls, it's not hard to imagine a similar device from Apple.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="launch_date">Launch Date</h2><br/>
Apple's upcoming iPad-like smart home accessory could be <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/30/apple-launch-smart-home-display-next-year/">released as soon as early 2025</a>.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-command-center/">Apple&#039;s Smart Home Command Center: What We Know So Far</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apples-smart-home-command-center-what-we-know-so-far.2443766/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Repair site iFixit today shared a teardown video of the M4 Pro <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro/">MacBook Pro</a>, giving us a look inside of the machine. Apple didn't make any external design changes to the &zwnj;MacBook Pro&zwnj; models, but iFixit was hopeful for repairability improvements.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe title="MacBook Pro M4 Teardown: What's Inside and What's Fixable?" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nTY6GJqiZHc" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div><br/>
Unfortunately, the M4 Pro &zwnj;MacBook Pro&zwnj; that iFixit took apart was almost identical to the M3 &zwnj;MacBook Pro&zwnj;, which means Apple kept almost the same internal design as well.<br/>
<br/>
The M4 Pro &zwnj;MacBook Pro&zwnj; has a larger heatsink than the M3 &zwnj;MacBook Pro&zwnj; for improved heat dissipation, but the battery build and size are the same. Removing the battery still requires removing the trackpad because the battery's adhesive tabs are under the trackpad hardware. Getting to the logic board is "incredibly complex and tedious" due to all the screws and the cables that are in the way.<br/>
<br/>
Overall, repairing and replacing parts in the &zwnj;MacBook Pro&zwnj; has not changed. Apple provides repair information, parts details, tools, and guides <a href="https://support.apple.com/self-service-repair">on its website</a>.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/22/ifixit-shares-m4-macbook-pro-teardown/">iFixit Shares M4 MacBook Pro Teardown</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ifixit-shares-m4-macbook-pro-teardown.2443760/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple <a href="https://www.apple.com/nz/newsroom/2024/11/apple-launches-tap-to-pay-on-iphone-in-new-zealand/">this week expanded</a> Tap to Pay on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> to New Zealand, which means independent sellers, small businesses, and other merchants in the country can use an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; as a contactless payment terminal.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/02/Apple-Tap-to-Pay-iPhone.jpeg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-836277" /><br/>
With Tap to Pay on &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;, an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; is able to accept payment using <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-pay/">Apple Pay</a>, contactless credit and debit cards, and other digital wallets thanks to NFC technology. Transactions are encrypted and Apple does not have information about what is purchased or the person that made the purchase.<br/>
<br/>
On the customer end, using Tap to Pay on &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; works like any standard &zwnj;Apple Pay&zwnj; transaction. Sellers open up an app on an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; XS or later, register a sale, and present an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; to the buyer, who can then use a contactless payment method to complete the transaction.<br/>
<br/>
Adyen, ANZ Bank, Stripe, Windcave, and Worldline offer Tap to Pay on &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; in New Zealand.<br/>
<br/>
Tap to Pay on &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; launched in February 2022 in the United States, and since then, Apple has been working to expand it to additional countries. The feature is available in Australia, Austria, Brazil, Canada, Czech Republic, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Japan, New Zealand, Netherlands, Romania, Sweden, Taiwan, Ukraine, the United Kingdom, and the United States.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/new-zealand/">New Zealand</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tap-to-pay-on-iphone/">Tap to Pay on iPhone</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/22/tap-to-pay-on-iphone-new-zealand/">Tap to Pay on iPhone Now Available in New Zealand</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/tap-to-pay-on-iphone-now-available-in-new-zealand.2443751/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Next year's iPhone 17 and all-new "<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17/#iphone_17_air">iPhone 17 Air</a>" will not have a 5x optical zoom lens, according to Korean publication <a href="https://www.thelec.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=31313"><em>The Elec</em></a> (via <em><a href="https://9to5mac.com/2024/11/22/more-sophisticated-iphone-17-pro-cameras-see-lg-innotech-upgrade-production-facilities/">9to5Mac</a></em>).<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/10/iPhone-17-Slim-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2100" height="1181" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-974632" /><br/>
The report said the tetraprism camera system that enables 5x optical zoom will remain exclusive to the Pro models in next year's iPhone lineup, meaning that it would only be available on the iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, with the iPhone 17 Air expected to be very thin, this is no surprise.<br/>
<br/>
In the iPhone 15 Pro Max, iPhone 16 Pro, and iPhone 16 Pro Max, the tetraprism camera system has a "folded" design that allows it to fit inside the smartphones, enabling up to 5x optical zoom and up to 25x digital zoom on those devices. The smaller iPhone 15 Pro, the iPhone 14 Pro, and the iPhone 14 Pro Max are limited to up to 3x optical zoom.<br/>
<br/>
The standard iPhone 16 offers up to 2x optical-quality zoom, so the iPhone 17 should too at a minimum. However, zoom specifications for the iPhone 17 Air are still unclear, as the device is rumored to feature <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/18/iphone-17-air-rumored-features/">only a single 48-megapixel rear camera</a>.<br/>
<br/>
iPhone 17 Air rumors have been a mixed bag so far. The device could <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/18/iphone-17-air-could-be-thinnest-iphone-ever/">become the thinnest iPhone ever</a>, but some of its specifications will seemingly be lacking compared to the Pro models, which will make for a tough purchasing decision. In other words, if you want the cool new iPhone with the thin, new design, there will be tradeoffs.<br/>
<br/>
There have been conflicting rumors about the iPhone 17 Air's design and specifications, but most sources have agreed that it will have <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/06/iphone-17-slim-to-feature-6-55-inch-display/">around a 6.6-inch display</a>. In July, Apple supply chain analyst Ming-Chi Kuo <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/24/kuo-ultra-thin-iphone-17-specs/">said</a> he expects the device to have a standard A19 chip, a Dynamic Island, a single rear camera, and an Apple-designed 5G modem.<br/>
<br/>
That means the iPhone 17 Air would have quite a large display, but the 6.9-inch iPhone 17 Pro Max would still be larger. With an A19 chip, the device would certainly be performant, but the iPhone 17 Pro models will get a superior A19 Pro chip. A single camera would put the device on the same tier as the iPhone SE for photography.<br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile, the iPhone 17 Air could be one of the first devices <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/24/kuo-iphone-se-4-thin-iphone-17-apple-5g-chip/">with an Apple-designed 5G modem</a>, but it is unclear if it will have any obvious consumer benefits over the Qualcomm modems that are expected to be used for iPhone 17 Pro models. Nevertheless, Apple's cellular future will debut in this device rather than the flagship Pro models.<br/>
<br/>
It's still early, so we should learn a lot more about the iPhone 17 Air over the coming months.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17/">iPhone 17</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/the-elec/">The Elec</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/22/iphone-17-and-17-air-said-to-lack-5x-optical-zoom/">iPhone 17 and &#039;iPhone 17 Air&#039; Expected to Lack 5x Optical Zoom Lens</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-17-and-iphone-17-air-expected-to-lack-5x-optical-zoom-lens.2443743/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today began selling <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/refurbished/ipad/ipad">certified refurbished iPad 10 models</a> through its online store in the U.S. for the first time since the device was released in October 2022.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/10/10th-Gen-iPad-Feature-Fanned-Blue.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-869880" /><br/>
Apple lowered the iPad 10's starting price to &#36;349 in the U.S. in May, and the refurbished models are discounted by an additional 15%, bringing the starting price down to &#36;299. 256GB models are also available for &#36;419, down from &#36;499 brand new.<br/>
<br/>
The refurbished iPad 10 models are not yet available in any other countries that we checked.<br/>
<br/>
Apple says its refurbished iPads include a new battery and outer shell, a new white box, and all manuals and accessories, including a USB-C charging cable and power adapter. Apple says it puts refurbished devices through a "thorough cleaning process and inspection," and it performs full functionality testing to ensure there are no defective units.<br/>
<br/>
All refurbished iPads are covered by Apple's one-year limited warranty and 14-day return policy, and eligible for AppleCare+ coverage.<br/>
<br/>
Be aware that Amazon not only has a better deal on the iPad 10 right now, but they are brand new models instead of refurbished. After applying an on-page coupon, you can <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0BJLCWFNM%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1"target="_blank"><strong>currently get the iPad 10 for as low as &#36;249.99 on Amazon</strong></a> in the U.S., which is a great value and an all-time low price for the tablet as far as we have seen.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[As someone who regularly uses my M4 iPad Pro as an extended Mac display via Sidecar and often plays around with Apple's Universal Control feature, finding the perfect iPad stand that will sit pretty on my constrained desk space has become something of a hobby. With this in mind, <a href="https://kuxiu.co/collections/ipad-charging-stand">KUXIU's Pro MAX</a> line of magnetic charging stands promises to solve two persistent iPad stand issues that frequently crop up: Positioning and power. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/11/kuxiu-ipad-magnetic-charging-stands.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-979015" /><br/>
I've spent several weeks testing their <a href="https://kuxiu.co/products/x33-pro-max-stand">X33 Pro MAX</a>, <a href="https://kuxiu.co/products/x36-pro-max-stand">X36 Pro MAX</a>, and <a href="https://kuxiu.co/products/kuxiu-x44-pro-max-stand">X44 Pro MAX</a> models, along with their optional magnetic protective case. The stands work with current iPad Pro models in both 11-inch and 13-inch sizes, as well as recent iPad Air models from the 4th generation onward - essentially any iPad with Smart Connector capability from 2018 and newer.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Design and Build</h2><br/>
These CNC aluminum stands share the same core feature: Magnetic attachment with integrated charging through the iPad's Smart Connector pins. Each model serves different needs - the X33 offers a traditional desk stand form factor, the X36 provides an adjustable arm design, and the X44 adds a rotating base for maximum flexibility.<br/>
<br/>
The build quality of the stands is impressive, particularly on the X36 Pro MAX. Its hollow arms allow for clean cable routing from the back of the stand's charging port to your desired connection point, whether that's a Mac or a power outlet. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/11/kuxiu-x36-pro-max.jpeg" alt="" width="5712" height="4007" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-979016" /><br/>
One thing to note is that the joints on the X36 are notably stiff, especially when new. Yes, it ensures stability, but it requires two hands for significant adjustments, and you won't want your iPad mounted while you're repositioning the arm – a sudden joint movement had me worried that the tablet could detach.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Charging and Connectivity</h2><br/>
The stands deliver up to 18W charging through the Smart Connector, leaving your iPad's USB-C port free for other connections. When first connecting your iPad, you'll see a Chinese keyboard prompt - simply dismiss it, and you won't see it again. The charging begins automatically every time you attach the iPad.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/11/kuxiu-x36-charging.jpeg" alt="" width="5712" height="4284" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-979017" /><br/>
One important thing I noticed is that your power source absolutely has to meet the minimum 18W requirement. Any less resulted in inconsistent on-off charging behavior in my testing. For reliable performance, I recommend using your iPad's original power adapter or an equivalent high-wattage USB-C charger.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Using the On-Screen Keyboard</h2><br/>
These stands create an interesting quirk in how iPadOS handles text input. Since they use the Smart Connector - the same connection used by Apple's Magic Keyboard - your iPad thinks it has a physical keyboard attached whenever it's mounted.<br/>
<br/>
This leads to a few notable behaviors. First, you'll get a one-time prompt about Chinese keyboard input when first connecting - simply tap "Not Now" to dismiss it permanently. Second, iPadOS will default to hiding the on-screen keyboard. You might also notice blue frames appearing around interface elements - this is iPadOS's Full Keyboard Access feature automatically enabling. You can disable it in Settings ➝ Accessibility ➝ Keyboards if it bothers you.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>X33 Pro MAX: The Traditional Desktop Stand</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/11/kuxiu-x33-pro-max.jpeg" alt="" width="5712" height="4284" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-979018" /><br/>
With a base footprint of approximately 6 inches wide and a maximum height of 12 inches when fully extended, the X33 strikes an excellent balance between stability and desk space efficiency. Its magnetic panel rotates 360 degrees vertically while offering 90-degree horizontal adjustment, and the stand folds down to just 2 inches in height for when you want a more comfortable angle for Apple Pencil note-taking or illustrating. This is also the most compact way to pack it for travel - though a carrying case would have been welcome at this price point.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/11/kuxiu-x33-pro-max-mac.jpeg" alt="" width="5712" height="4284" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-979020" /><br/>
The charging port lives in a raised rectangular platform on the back of the panel, which keeps the connection, if not the cable, out of sight and leaves your iPad's USB-C port available. The aluminum construction feels premium, with precisely machined joints that move smoothly. During my use, the X33 excelled as a desktop companion - it allowed me to type fairly aggressively on my iPad's screen without wobble, even at full extension. The charging performance remains consistent, and the compact design manages heat particularly well with no thermal throttling during extended sessions. However, the rear USB-C cable connection could use better integration into the design for cleaner desk aesthetics.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>X36 Pro MAX: The Flexible Arm Solution</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/11/kuxiux36-pro-max-table-e1732290810622.jpeg" alt="" width="5712" height="4284" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-979022" /><br/>
The X36 features seven adjustable joints plus horizontal and vertical adjusters, with each arm segment measuring approximately 8 inches for up to 24 inches in total height. This extensive reach makes it my preferred choice for Sidecar use, as I can position the iPad exactly at monitor height in a multi-display setup. The desk clamp accommodates surfaces up to 1.97 inches thick, with silicone padding protecting your desk.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/11/kuxiu-x36-pro-macbook.jpeg" alt="" width="5712" height="4284" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-979023" /><br/>
KUXIU's attention to detail shows in the construction. The clamp mechanism is rock-solid, and while each joint moves independently, they all require significant force to adjust - a worthy trade-off for stability, though as I mentioned above, be wary of sudden give in the joints as you apply pressure. The hollow arm design proves especially useful for cable management. I managed to route both power and a USB-C data cable through it for a cleaner setup. Despite its more complex design, the X36 maintains solid charging performance, but in my experience it's best to avoid extreme angles that might stress the USB-C connection.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>X44 Pro MAX: The Swiveling Stand</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/11/kuxiu-x44-pro-max.jpeg" alt="" width="5712" height="3794" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-979025" /><br/>
The X44 is similar to the X33, but uses a smooth-turning ball-joint that rotates the entire arm assembly 360 degrees. The joint at the top allows for vertical and rotational adjustment, while the circular base can be swiveled to any position for easy screen viewing adjustment. The whole mechanism feels well-engineered, with no play or wobble even when fully extended.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/11/kuxiu-x44-pro-max-swivel-e1732291114726.jpeg" alt="" width="5712" height="3295" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-979027" /><br/>
Like the X33, it folds down for portability, but adds the versatility of the X36's articulation. The dual-hinge design makes switching between portrait and landscape particularly fluid, but it does have some stiff joint characteristics, though they aren't as stubborn as the X36. The charging performance maintains the same 18W delivery as its siblings, and the additional moving parts haven't introduced any connectivity issues in my testing.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>The Magnetic Protective Case</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/11/kuxiu-case.jpeg" alt="" width="5712" height="4284" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-979028" /><br/>
KUXIU also offers a magnetic protective case designed to work with these stands while maintaining compatibility with Apple's Magic Keyboard. While the case successfully conducts power through the Smart Connector and includes precise cutouts for keyboard attachment, its protective capabilities are limited. The thin plastic construction covers only about 90% of the iPad's rear surface and only two corners, offering basic scratch protection but little impact resistance.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/11/kuxiu-case-hand.jpeg" alt="" width="4032" height="3024" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-979030" /><br/>
The case also proved troublesome with the Magic Keyboard - despite KUXIU's claims, I found it hard to close the keyboard properly with the case attached unless the iPad was topside and weighing down on the enclosure mechanism. Additionally, the slippery texture and tight fit make the case difficult to remove once installed. While it's nice to have a case option that works with the charging stands, it's expensive for what it is, and I'd recommend using your iPad naked with these stands instead.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Summing Up</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/11/64631.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="1331" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-979034" /><br/>
Each KUXIU Pro MAX stand fills a distinct niche, with thoughtful engineering and solid charging performance across the line. The X33 shines as a space-efficient desktop solution that's ideal for those who prioritize portability. Meanwhile, the X36's long articulating arm makes it a great option for multi-display setups and Sidecar users, though its stiff joints do require some muscle. And the X44 splits the difference, adding a rotating base that's particularly valuable for collaborative work or anyone who values a wide scope of lateral movement.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/11/kuxiu.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="676" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-979035" /><br/>
While all three deliver on their charging promises, your choice largely depends on your workspace needs. The X33's traditional design feels most refined, the X36 offers unmatched positioning flexibility, and the X44 provides the best balance of features for most users.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Where to Buy</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/11/kuxiu02.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="656" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-979036" /><br/>
KUXIU is currently offering decent Black Friday discounts across the Pro MAX line: The <a href="https://kuxiu.co/products/x33-pro-max-stand">X33 Pro MAX</a> costs &#36;85.49 (down from &#36;109.99), the <a href="https://kuxiu.co/products/x36-pro-max-stand">X36 Pro MAX</a> costs &#36;104.48 (down from &#36;139.99), and <a href="https://kuxiu.co/products/kuxiu-x44-pro-max-stand">X44 Pro MAX</a> is priced at &#36;94.98 (down from &#36;139.99). And if you're interested in the protective case, it's currently going for &#36;50.34 (down from &#36;59.99). All of the stands are also available on the <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fstores%2Fpage%2F03444B3F-5295-4694-87B3-8743AC1D339E">company's Amazon store</a>. Given the stands' feature set and build quality, the promotional prices represent decent value, particularly for the X36 with its long adjustable arm and the X44 Pro MAX with its versatile rotating base. I'm just not a fan of the optional case.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple has encouraged its display panel suppliers to scale up their investments in laptop-sized OLED displays, Taiwanese research firm TrendForce said <a href="https://www.trendforce.com/presscenter/news/20241121-12374.html">in a press release</a> this week. This revelation comes as Apple prepares to launch its first MacBook Pro models with OLED displays, which are likely still a few years away.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/10/Apple-MacBook-Pro-M4-hero.jpg" alt="" width="3840" height="2160" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-974025" /><br/>
In line with previous reports, TrendForce said Apple plans to begin using OLED displays for MacBooks between 2026 and 2027.<br/>
<br/>
LG and Samsung will likely be Apple's two major suppliers of OLED displays for the MacBook Pro.<br/>
<br/>
Compared to current MacBook Pro models with mini-LED screens, benefits of OLED technology would include increased brightness, higher contrast ratio with deeper blacks, improved power efficiency for longer battery life, and more. The switch to OLED displays could also contribute to future MacBook Pro models having a thinner design.<br/>
<br/>
Indeed, thinner MacBook Pro models with OLED displays are <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/03/future-macbook-pro-rumors/">rumored to launch in 2026</a>.<br/>
<br/>
In the interim, the MacBook Pro is not expected to receive any major changes. Unsurprisingly, next year's models are expected to get a spec bump to M5, M5 Pro, and M5 Max chips, but no redesign is expected until the switch to OLED displays.<br/>
<br/>
Apple updated the MacBook Pro line last month with M4, M4 Pro, and M4 Max chips.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro/">MacBook Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/trendforce/">TrendForce</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Pro_16">MacBook Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macbook-pro.90">MacBook Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/22/apple-preparing-for-oled-macbook-pros/">Apple Preparing for MacBook Pro Models With OLED Displays</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-preparing-for-macbook-pro-models-with-oled-displays.2443726/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The next episode of Apple TV+'s award-winning sci-fi series "Silo" will be released early.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/silo-tv-show-apple-tv-plus.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-901731" /><br/>
Apple previously announced that new "Silo" episodes would be released on Fridays, but the third episode of the second season will instead be released on Wednesday, November 27. Apple has likely bumped up the date so that people can watch the episode during the U.S. Thanksgiving holiday on Thursday, November 28.<br/>
<br/>
As astute Apple TV+ viewers know, this actually means the episode should be available to watch as early as Tuesday, November 26 at 9 p.m. Eastern Time.<br/>
<br/>
"Silo" follows the last 10,000 people on Earth, all of whom live in a massive underground bunker to escape the seemingly toxic and deadly world outside. The people are unaware of why the silo was built, and those who seek the truth face deadly consequences. Rebecca Ferguson stars as Juliette Nichols, an engineer who attempts to unravel the mysteries surrounding the silo following a loved one's murder. The sci-fi series is based on Hugh Howey's best-selling book series. Ferguson and Howey both serve as executive producers.<br/>
<br/>
Apple TV+ costs &#36;9.99 per month or &#36;99 per year in the U.S., and the streaming service is also included in all Apple One subscription bundles.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-tv-plus/">Apple TV Plus</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/22/apple-tv-plus-releasing-next-silo-episode-early/">Apple TV+ Releasing Next Week&#039;s &#039;Silo&#039; Episode Early</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-tv-releasing-next-weeks-silo-episode-early.2443720/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The Indonesian government is pushing Apple for a higher investment than its recently proposed &#36;100 million before it will consider lifting its ban on iPhone 16 sales in the country, according to statements from government officials on Thursday.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/iphone-16-design.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-964722" /><br/>
Industry minister Agus Gumiwang Kartasasmita has held internal meetings to discuss Apple's proposal, but a ministry spokesperson reportedly said that the government expects more substantial commitments from the company.<br/>
<br/>
"From the government's perspective, of course, we want this investment to be larger," Febri Hendri Antoni Arif told <em><a href="https://en.antaranews.com/news/335417/apple-expected-to-invest-over-us100-mln-says-ministry">Antara News</a></em>. The government is particularly interested in having Apple source components from domestic suppliers, suggesting this would create a "multiplier effect" for local employment.<br/>
<br/>
Apple's current <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/19/apple-ups-invest-offer-indonesia-iphone-16-ban/">&#36;100 million proposal</a> was a significant increase from its initial &#36;10 million offer <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/05/indonesia-iphone-ban-apple-10m-investment/">earlier this month</a>, and includes plans for research and development facilities and developer academies in Bali and Jakarta over a two-year period. The proposal also outlines plans to manufacture AirPods Max ear cup mesh components in Bandung starting July 2025.<br/>
<br/>
The ongoing negotiations follow Indonesia's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/28/indonesia-bans-iphone-16-sales/">October 28</a> ban on iPhone 16 sales, implemented after authorities determined Apple had not met the country's requirement for 40% domestic content in smartphones. The government also claims Apple has invested only &#36;95 million through developer academies, falling short of a previously promised &#36;109.6 million commitment.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/indonesia/">Indonesia</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/22/indonesia-wants-larger-investment-iphone-16-ban/">Indonesia Wants Larger Apple Investment to Lift iPhone 16 Ban</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/indonesia-wants-larger-apple-investment-to-lift-iphone-16-ban.2443712/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The European Commission has ended its antitrust investigation into Apple's App Store rules for ebook and audiobook apps, following the withdrawal of a complaint by an ebook distributor.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/App-Store-vs-EU-Feature-2.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-932826" /><br/>
Originally <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2020/06/16/eu-opens-investigations-app-store-apple-pay/">launched in June 2020</a>, the investigation was sparked by a complaint from Rakuten's Kobo subsidiary. Kobo had <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2020/06/16/apple-new-eu-antitrust-complaint-kobo/">argued</a> that Apple's mandatory 30% commission on App Store purchases made it virtually impossible to operate profitably while competing with Apple Books, which isn't subject to the same fee structure.<br/>
<br/>
The probe examined Apple's requirement that developers use its in-app purchase system, and restrictions preventing developers from informing iPhone and iPad users about cheaper purchasing options outside the App Store.<br/>
<br/>
Although this particular investigation has concluded, the Commission said that the closure does not indicate Apple's conduct complies with EU competition rules. Apple still faces scrutiny under both EU competition laws and the Digital Markets Act (DMA), which designates Apple as a "gatekeeper" and requires changes to its App Store practices.<br/>
<br/>
The ebook investigation was one of three parallel probes launched by the Commission in 2020. In March 2024, the Commission <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/19/apple-fined-500-million-eu-music-probe/">fined</a> Apple over its music streaming app practices.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/antitrust/">Apple Antitrust</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/european-commission/">European Commission</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/european-union/">European Union</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/22/eu-closes-antitrust-probe-apple-ebook-rules/">EU Closes Antitrust Probe Into Apple&#039;s Ebook App Store Rules</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/eu-closes-antitrust-probe-into-apples-ebook-app-store-rules.2443710/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's restrictions on mobile browsers are limiting innovation and holding back new features that could benefit iPhone users, according to provisional findings published today by the UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA).<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/06/app-store-blue-banner-uk-fixed.jpg" alt="" width="1794" height="1009" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-804521" /><br/>
In its <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/cma-publishes-provisional-findings-in-mobile-browsers-and-cloud-gaming-market-investigation">report</a>, the CMA's independent inquiry group determined that Apple's Safari browser policies prevent competing browsers from implementing certain features, such as faster webpage loading technologies. The investigation also revealed that many UK app developers would prefer to offer progressive web apps as an alternative to App Store distribution, but Apple's current iOS limitations make this impractical.<br/>
<br/>
Adding to competitive concerns, the regulator highlighted a revenue-sharing agreement between Apple and Google that "significantly reduces their financial incentives to compete" in the mobile browser space on iOS. The CMA also found that both companies can manipulate how users are presented with browser choices, making their own offerings appear as the clearest or easiest options.<br/>
<br/>
"Through our investigation, we have provisionally found that competition between different mobile browsers is not working well and this is holding back innovation in the UK," said Margot Daly, chair of the CMA's independent inquiry group.<br/>
<br/>
The investigation initially covered <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/11/22/uk-cma-market-probe-apple-google/">both mobile browsers and cloud gaming concerns</a>, but the CMA has decided not to pursue action regarding cloud gaming, noting that Apple has already addressed the primary issue by beginning to allow cloud gaming apps on the App Store.<br/>
<br/>
In its <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/673f635659aab43310b95aea/Notice_of_provisional_findings.pdf">summary of provisional decision</a>, the regulator is recommending that these findings be addressed through the UK's upcoming Digital Markets, Competition and Consumers Act, which takes effect in January 2025. This legislation will give the CMA new powers to designate firms as having "Strategic Market Status" and impose appropriate interventions to promote competition.<br/>
<br/>
The CMA is accepting public comments on its provisional findings until December 13, with a final decision expected in March 2025. Similar investigations into mobile browser competition are currently being conducted by the European Commission and the United States Department of Justice.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Update:</strong> Apple provided MacRumors with the following statement: <br/>
<blockquote>"Apple believes in thriving and dynamic markets where innovation can flourish. We face competition in every segment and jurisdiction where we operate, and our focus is always the trust of our users. We disagree with the findings in the report regarding Safari, WebKit, and in-app browsing on iOS. We are concerned that the interventions discussed in the report for future consideration under the Digital Markets, Competition, and Consumers Act would undermine user privacy and security and hinder our ability to make the kind of technology that sets Apple apart. We will continue to engage constructively with the CMA as their work on this matter progresses."</blockquote>Apple maintains that it fosters robust competition by offering a variety of WebKit-based third-party browsers on the App Store that compete alongside Safari, and that settings are included in iOS that allow users to easily switch their default browser. <div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/antitrust/">Apple Antitrust</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/united-kingdom/">United Kingdom</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/22/apple-browser-rules-stifle-innovation-cma/">Apple&#039;s Browser Rules Stifle Innovation on iOS, Says UK Regulator</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apples-browser-rules-stifle-innovation-on-ios-says-uk-regulator.2443707/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Belkin last month <a href="https://www.belkin.com/support-article/?articleNum=336820">voluntarily recalled</a> the BoostCharge Pro Fast Wireless Charger for Apple Watch + Power Bank 10K (model BPD005). The company said it will be offering a full refund to all customers who purchased the product.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/05/belkin-boostcharge-pro.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-897190" /><br/>
In its recall notice, Belkin said a manufacturing defect can cause the battery in the power bank to overheat, which could pose a fire hazard to consumers.<br/>
<br/>
Belkin has advised customers to immediately stop using the product:<blockquote>If you have purchased the Belkin BoostCharge Pro Fast Wireless Charger for Apple Watch + Power Bank 10K, BPD005, it is important that you immediately stop using it, disconnect it from any power supply or other products, and contact us for further instructions. Place your BPD005 in a safe, dry location away from anything flammable or anything that can damage the power bank. Do not place your power bank into any trash or recycling bins.</blockquote>More details are available <a href="https://www.belkin.com/support-article/?articleNum=336820">on Belkin's website</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Belkin released the BoostCharge Pro Fast Wireless Charger for Apple Watch + Power Bank 10K in May 2023. The power bank has a 10,000 mAh battery, a 20W USB-C charging port, and a built-in fast-charging puck for the Apple Watch Series 7 and newer.<br/>
<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Between 2011 and 2014, there were a glut of rumors suggesting that Apple was working on an Apple-branded television set, which would disrupt the TV industry. No such product ever emerged, but now the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/17/apple-evaluating-a-tv-set-report/">TV rumors are back</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/62rdcVrffJI" title="New Apple Smart Home Hub and TV Rumors" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/macrumors?sub_confirmation=1">Subscribe to the MacRumors YouTube channel</a> for more videos.</em></div><br/>
<h2 id="apple_evaluating_a_tv">Apple 'Evaluating' a TV</h2><br/>
According to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-11-17/how-will-president-donald-trump-s-new-tariffs-affect-apple-products-and-prices-m3lnfx64"><em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman</a>, Apple is "evaluating" the "idea of making an Apple-branded TV" set as part of its new smart home push. Apple is investing resources into the smart home as it looks for new ways to generate revenue, and if some of the first smart home products are successful, it's possible a TV could be on the roadmap.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="apples_smart_home_command_center">Apple's Smart Home Command Center</h2><br/>
As soon as March 2025, Apple will <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/12/apple-home-command-center-march-2025/">launch a smart home hub</a> or "command center" that will serve as its first dedicated smart home control product. The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod/">HomePod</a> can already be added to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/homekit/">HomeKit</a> and used as Home Hubs, but the new device is aimed specifically at managing &zwnj;HomeKit&zwnj; and Matter devices.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/11/Apple-AI-Command-Center-Concept-Mock-3.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-978084" /><br/>
According to <em>Bloomberg</em>'s <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a>, the smart home device will have a six-inch square display. It's said to be similar in design to an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>, but not rectangular. There are thick bezels around the edges, a rechargeable battery, and built-in speakers, along with a camera at the top that can be used for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/facetime/">FaceTime</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Apple is planning to allow users to mount the device on a wall or on a desktop with a dock, and customers will have the option to have them in multiple rooms. Along with controlling smart home products, the hub will be used as a sort of life management device with <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/">Apple Intelligence</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a> integration, widgets that display important information, and apps like Calendar, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/photos/">Photos</a>, Home, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-news/">Apple News</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/">Apple Music</a>, and Notes.<br/>
<br/>
Sensors inside the hub will determine whether a person is in the room and if so how close, with information on the screen tailored based on the person's position. That kind of presence sensing could also be used in various &zwnj;HomeKit&zwnj; automations.<br/>
<br/>
If the product ends up being successful, it could potentially spawn a line of Apple-designed in-homeproducts, including a TV set.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="other_smart_home_product_rumors">Other Smart Home Product Rumors</h2><br/>
Apple is considering a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/12/apple-smart-home-products/">range of smart home accessories</a>, such as smart home cameras. As of right now, Apple makes the &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj; and &zwnj;HomePod&zwnj;, but cameras, smart plugs, smart lights, and other devices come from third-party manufacturers.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/11/homekit-showdown-redux.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-977115" /><br/>
Rumors suggest that Apple is designing a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/11/kuo-apple-smart-home-camera-and-more-2026/">smart home camera</a> that will be manufactured in 2026. Apple could sell "tens of millions" of the devices over the long term, leaning on its privacy policies to provide an alternative to cameras from companies like Ring and Nest.<br/>
<br/>
If Apple does end up seeing success with the hub and subsequent products like cameras, it's not hard to imagine a future where a TV set could finally make sense.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="the_original_tv_set_rumors">The Original TV Set Rumors</h2><br/>
Rumors about an &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj; set have <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2006/01/06/apple-to-announce-42-and-50-plasma-viiv-displays/">dated back to 2006</a>, but picked up in 2011 after a former Apple executive claimed that Apple had <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2011/06/21/apple-television-set-rumors-revived-to-launch-in-2011/">inked a deal</a> with a TV manufacturer. Later that same year, a quote from Steve Jobs in Walter Isaacson's biography about him made headlines.<br/>
<br/>
"I finally cracked it," Jobs allegedly said in reference to a TV set. "I'd like to create an integrated television set that is completely easy to use," he is said to have told Isaacson. The TV "would be seamlessly synced" with devices and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/icloud/">iCloud</a>, and users would not "have to fiddle with complex remotes."<br/>
<br/>
That quote kept TV set rumors going for years, but in 2014 and 2015, it started becoming clear no TV was coming.<br/>
<br/>
In 2014, a new Steve Jobs book suggested Jobs told employees that no TV was in the works in 2010. "TV is a terrible business," Jobs said. "They don't turn over, and the margins suck." In 2015, <em>The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/wsj-com/">Wall Street Journal</a></em> said that <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2015/05/18/apple-nixed-plans-for-television-set/">Apple nixed plans</a> for an Apple-branded TV set "more than a year ago." At the time, the report said that Apple searched for breakthrough features that would give it an edge in the television market, but it could not find new features that were compelling enough to compete against existing big TV manufacturers.<br/>
<br/>
In 2016, reporter and longtime Jobs friend Walt Mossberg said that Jobs planned to reinvent the television industry after stepping down as Apple's CEO in August 2011, but he ended up passing away from pancreatic cancer less than two months later in October 2011.<br/>
<br/>
"I think we figured out a way to do it, and it's going to be fantastic. I want you to come out, in a few months, and I want to show it to you," Jobs told Mossberg.<br/>
<br/>
After TV set rumors died down, focus instead turned to Apple's work to create a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2015/02/04/apple-web-based-tv-service/">TV streaming service</a> with support for bundles of channels from participating content providers. Apple wanted to offer a range of content from third-party companies, but with its own interface. The company's plans had to be <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2014/02/12/apple-tv-less-ambitious-than-before/">scaled back</a> several times, and Apple wasn't ever able to establish the content deals that would have been needed for that original idea at the time.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="how_things_have_changed">How Things Have Changed</h2><br/>
Since those initial TV set rumors, Apple has made inroads in the television industry. By 2017, rumors were starting to focus on Apple's plan to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2017/06/16/apple-hires-sony-tv-original-programming/">create original content</a> since it couldn't license content, and that's exactly what ended up happening.<br/>
<br/>
In November 2019, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2019/03/25/streaming-service-apple-tv/">Apple introduced Apple TV+</a>, and it has continued adding new TV shows and movies over the course of the last five years. &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj;+ now has a decent amount of content available, and there are also other services like &zwnj;Apple Music&zwnj; that didn't exist back when Apple was considering building a TV set.<br/>
<br/>
Apple has been working on cutting-edge display technology, and while the TV market continues to be crowded with Samsung, LG, and Sony dominating, there could now be an opportunity for Apple to make a viable product that will appeal to consumers.<br/>
<br/>
Since 2014 when TV rumors died out, Apple has come out with products that could provide more of a reason to release a TV set. Apple has more experience with speakers, earbuds, remotes, and other devices and technologies.<br/>
<ul><br/>
 <li>&zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj; 4K</li><br/>
 <li>&zwnj;Siri&zwnj; Remote</li><br/>
 <li><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-pencil/">Apple Pencil</a></li><br/>
 <li>AirPods</li><br/>
 <li>&zwnj;HomePod&zwnj;</li><br/>
 <li>OLED, miniLED, and micro OLED displays</li><br/>
 <li>&zwnj;Apple Music&zwnj;</li><br/>
 <li>&zwnj;Apple News&zwnj;</li><br/>
 <li>&zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj;+</li><br/>
 <li><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-arcade/">Apple Arcade</a></li><br/>
 <li>Apple Fitness+</li><br/>
 <li>&zwnj;Apple Intelligence&zwnj;</li><br/>
</ul><br/>
Apple is more desperate for new products that could be big money makers today than it was in 2014, because the smartphone market is so saturated that it doesn't see the same kinds of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> sales gains that it saw in prior years.<br/>
<br/>
Apple hoped to get into the automobile market, but after years of research and billions of dollars, all plans <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/27/apple-cancels-electric-car-project/">for an Apple Car were canceled</a>. Apple's other big gamble, augmented and virtual reality, hasn't yet seen success as the Vision Pro has floundered, and its work on artificial intelligence is still in the early stages.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="possible_launch_date">Possible Launch Date</h2><br/>
The smart home hub that Apple is working on is slated for an early 2025 launch, and it's possible the first home product, a camera, could follow in 2026. Given that a TV set isn't even a solid plan as of yet, we could be nearing the end of the decade before Apple is able to launch one.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-tv-set/">Will Apple Make a TV?

		<description><![CDATA[Apple is working on a smarter version of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a> that employees have taken to calling "LLM &zwnj;Siri&zwnj;," reports <em><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-11-21/apple-readies-more-conversational-llm-siri-in-bid-to-rival-openai-s-chatgpt">Bloomberg</a></em>. Apple is designing the more capable &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; to better compete with chatbots like ChatGPT, with plans to utilize "advanced large language models."<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/04/Apple-Silicon-AI-Optimized-Feature-Siri-1.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-947754" /><br/>
A chatbot version of &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; would be able to hold ongoing conversations, much like ChatGPT. Apple wants customers to be able to better converse with the personal assistant, with &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; responding more like a human. The use of large language models will also allow &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; to perform much more complex tasks, which Apple has to rely on OpenAI's ChatGPT for in iOS 18.2.<br/>
<br/>
Apple is working on improving what &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; can do in and between apps with <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/">Apple Intelligence</a> in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a>, and that will lay some of the groundwork for the updated version of &zwnj;Siri&zwnj;. For that functionality, Apple will use a first-generation Apple LLM to evaluate requests to determine whether the existing &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; infrastructure should be used, or if a second LLM that's able to handle more complex requests should be queried.<br/>
<br/>
Apple is testing the new &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; in a separate app on iPhones, iPads, and Macs, but it will eventually replace the current version of &zwnj;Siri&zwnj;. The &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; update could be announced as soon as 2025, likely as part of the June Worldwide Developers Conference that will see Apple unveil iOS 19.<br/>
<br/>
While &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; will be previewed early, Apple does not intend to launch the update until several months after it is unveiled. As of now, Apple is aiming for a spring 2026 launch date, but Apple's plans could change.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/">Apple Intelligence</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/21/apple-llm-siri-2026/">Apple Working on &#039;LLM Siri&#039; for 2026 Launch</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-working-on-llm-siri-for-2026-launch.2443676/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Barring any surprises, Apple is not expected to release any more new hardware before 2024 ends. Apple is rumored to have many product announcements planned for the first half of next year, though, including an all-new smart home hub, the iPhone SE 4, an AirTag 2, an updated iPad Air, an iPad 11, and updated MacBook Air models.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/11/Apple-in-2025.jpg" alt="" width="3200" height="1800" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-978874" /><br/>
Below, we recap rumors about all of those upcoming products.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Home Hub</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/11/Apple-AI-Command-Center-Concept-Mock-4.5.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-978086" /><br/>
Apple's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/12/apple-home-command-center-march-2025/">all-new smart home hub</a> is expected as early as March.<br/>
<br/>
The hub is expected to feature around a 6-inch display that can be attached to a tabletop base with a speaker or mounted on a wall. The device is rumored to run a new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/29/tvos-17-4-homeos-mention/">"homeOS" operating system</a> with a customizable widget-focused home screen, and it is expected to support both Siri and Apple Intelligence. Proximity sensors could detect how far away a person is and automatically adjust the size of widgets shown on the screen.<br/>
<br/>
The device will allow users to manage HomeKit accessories, and it could double as a home security system by displaying camera footage. And with a built-in camera, users will be able to make FaceTime video calls with the device.<br/>
<br/>
The hub will compete with products like Google's Nest Hub and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/20/amazon-echo-show-21-inch-display/">Amazon's Echo Show</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>iPhone SE 4</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/iPhone-SE-4-Thumb-1.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-951978" /><br/>
Apple plans to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/19/iphone-se-4-expected-to-launch-in-march/">release the iPhone SE 4 in March</a>, according to multiple reports.<br/>
<br/>
The device is expected to have a similar design as the base iPhone 14, with rumored features including a 6.1-inch OLED display, Face ID, a newer chip than the A15 Bionic in the current model, a USB-C port, a single 48-megapixel rear camera, 8GB of RAM for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/01/new-iphone-se-and-ipad-air-early-2025-rumor/">Apple Intelligence support</a>, and the first <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/24/kuo-iphone-se-4-thin-iphone-17-apple-5g-chip/">Apple-designed 5G modem</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Apple is rumored to have been working on its own 5G modem for iPhones since 2018, a move that will allow it to reduce and eventually eliminate its dependance on its current supplier Qualcomm. It is unclear if Apple's first 5G modem will have any consumer benefits compared to Qualcomm's modems, such as faster cellular data speeds.<br/>
<br/>
Apple announced the iPhone SE 3 during an online event <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/03/08/apple-announces-new-iphone-se/">in March 2022</a>. The device looks similar to the iPhone 8, with outdated features such as a Touch ID button, Lightning port, and thick bezels around the display. In the U.S., the iPhone SE currently starts at &#36;429, but the new model might see at least a slight price increase.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>AirTag 2</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/airtag-purple.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-964244" /><br/>
Apple is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/17/airtag-2-mid-2025-rumor/">aiming to release a new AirTag in mid-2025</a>, according to <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman</a>.<br/>
<br/>
A key new feature rumored for the AirTag 2 is an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/19/airtag-with-new-chip-due-next-year/">upgraded Ultra Wideband chip with improved location tracking</a>. If so, the AirTag could be updated with the second-generation Ultra Wideband chip that debuted in all iPhone 15 models last year.<br/>
<br/>
The new AirTag could be more tamper-proof, according to Gurman. He said the accessory's built-in speaker will be more difficult to remove, as an anti-stalking measure. He also expects the new AirTag to provide "better range," which could allow the Precision Finding feature to work at farther distances. No other design changes have been rumored.<br/>
<br/>
According to Apple supply chain analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, the new AirTag will have some kind of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/02/kuo-new-airtag-production-late-2024/">integration with the Apple Vision Pro headset</a>.<br/>
<br/>
The current AirTag was announced in April 2021.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>New iPad Air Models With New Magic Keyboard</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/m2-ipad-air-fathers-day.jpg" alt="" width="3840" height="2160" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-954134" /><br/>
Minor updates to the 11-inch and 13-inch iPad Air models are <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/01/new-iphone-se-and-ipad-air-early-2025-rumor/">expected in spring 2025</a>.<br/>
<br/>
It is possible that a new chip will be one of the only upgrades the iPad Air receives, but it is unclear if Apple will give it the M3 chip or the M4 chip. While the M3 chip would be a logical choice, Apple has been quickly transitioning away from chips built with TSMC's first-generation 3nm process. So, perhaps the iPad Air will get the same M4 chip used in the latest iPad Pro models. There is precedent for that, as the iPad Pro and iPad Air had the M1 chip simultaneously for around six months in 2022.<br/>
<br/>
An <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/09/new-magic-keyboard-for-ipad-air-2025-rumor/">updated Magic Keyboard for both iPad Air models is also expected</a>, and it should gain some of the features introduced on the latest Magic Keyboard for the iPad Pro. That means potential features for the next iPad Air version of the accessory include a thinner and lighter design with an aluminum palm rest, a larger glass trackpad, and a row of function keys with shortcuts for things like display brightness and volume.<br/>
<br/>
The current iPad Air models with the M2 chip launched in May this year.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>iPad 11</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/10/10th-Gen-iPad-Feature-Fanned-Blue.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-869880" /><br/>
The entry-level iPad is also expected to receive an update <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/23/ipad-11-launch-timing-report/">in spring 2025</a>.<br/>
<br/>
The device will likely support Apple Intelligence, according to Gurman. That suggests the iPad 11 will get a newer A-series chip compared to the iPad 10, and an increased 8GB of RAM. No major design changes have been rumored for the device.<br/>
<br/>
Apple released the iPad 10 in October 2022. It has an A14 Bionic chip.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>New MacBook Air Models</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/macbook-air-new-blue.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-939665" /><br/>
The next Macs to receive the M4 chip should be the 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Air <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/23/m4-macbook-air-production-beginning-soon/">in spring 2025</a>. No other major changes are expected for the laptops.<br/>
<br/>
The current MacBook Air models launched in March this year.<br/>
<br/>
Since last month, all MacBook Air models <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/30/macbook-air-now-starts-with-16gb-ram/">now start with 16GB of RAM</a>, up from 8GB.

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today <a href="https://developer.apple.com/safari/download/">released a new update</a> for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/safari-technology-preview/">Safari Technology Preview</a>, the experimental browser that was <a href="http://www.macrumors.com/2016/03/30/apple-safari-technology-preview-browser/">first introduced</a> in March 2016. Apple designed &zwnj;Safari Technology Preview&zwnj; to allow users to test features that are planned for future release versions of the Safari browser.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-960117" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/Safari-Technology-Preview-Updated-Feature-1.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" /><br/>
&zwnj;Safari Technology Preview&zwnj; 208 includes fixes and updates for CSS, JavaScript, Rendering, Scrolling, Web API, Web Authentication, Web Extensions, Web Inspector, and WebRTC.<br/>
<br/>
The current &zwnj;Safari Technology Preview&zwnj; release is compatible with machines running macOS Sonoma and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sequoia/">macOS Sequoia</a>, the newest version of macOS.<br/>
<br/>
The &zwnj;Safari Technology Preview&zwnj; update is available through the Software Update mechanism in System Preferences or System Settings to anyone who has <a href="https://developer.apple.com/safari/download/">downloaded the browser</a> from Apple’s website. Complete release notes for the update are available <a href="https://developer.apple.com/safari/technology-preview/release-notes/">on the Safari Technology Preview website</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Apple’s aim with &zwnj;Safari Technology Preview&zwnj; is to gather feedback from developers and users on its browser development process. &zwnj;Safari Technology Preview&zwnj; can run side-by-side with the existing Safari browser and while it is designed for developers, it does not require a developer account to download and use.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/safari-technology-preview/">Safari Technology Preview</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/21/apple-releases-safari-technology-preview-208/">Apple Releases Safari Technology Preview 208 With Bug Fixes and Performance Improvements</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-releases-safari-technology-preview-208-with-bug-fixes-and-performance-improvements.2443669/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>
