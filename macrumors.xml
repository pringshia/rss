		<description><![CDATA[iOS 18 will be released to the public <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/09/ios-18-launching-september-16/">on Monday</a>, but the first Apple Intelligence features will not be available until iOS 18.1 is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/09/ios-18-1-available-in-october/">released in October</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/iphone-16-pro-apple-intelligence.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-964666" /><br/>
Apple Intelligence features will continue to roll out in iOS 18.2 and beyond, with the expected roadmap outlined below per Apple's website and rumors.<br/>
<br/>
Apple Intelligence requires an iPhone 15 Pro model or any iPhone 16 model, and it will initially require device and Siri language being set to U.S. English.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>iOS 18.1</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/ios-18-apple-intelligence-notification-summary.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-956653" /><br/>
Here are some of the key Apple Intelligence features in the iOS 18.1 beta so far:<br/>
<br/>
<ul><br/>
<li>A few Siri enhancements, including improved understanding for both follow-up requests and when you stumble over your words</li><br/>
<li>Writing tools for rewriting, summarizing, and proofreading text</li><br/>
<li>Notification summaries for Messages, Mail, and many other apps</li><br/>
<li>Suggested replies in the Messages and Mail apps</li><br/>
<li>A new "Clean Up" tool in the Photos app that can remove unwanted people or objects from photos and use generative AI to fill in the background</li><br/>
<li>The ability to create a Memories movie in the Photos app by typing a description</li><br/>
<li>Phone call recording and transcription</li><br/>
<li>A new Focus mode called Reduce Interruptions that surfaces important notifications only</li><br/>
<li>Article summaries when using Reader Mode in the Safari app</li><br/>
</ul>See our <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/29/ios-18-1-apple-intelligence-features/">full list of Apple Intelligence features included in the iOS 18.1 beta</a> for even more.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>iOS 18.2</h2><br/>
Apple has been internally testing iOS 18.2 for at least a few months now, based on evidence of the software version in our website's analytics logs.<br/>
<br/>
iOS 18.2 will likely be released in December, as that is when Apple said that it will be making Apple Intelligence available in more English-speaking countries.<br/>
<br/>
<h3>Apple Intelligence in More Countries</h3><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/Apple-Intelligence-December.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="898" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-965412" /><br/>
As mentioned, iOS 18.2 should expand Apple Intelligence to Australia, Canada, New Zealand, South Africa, and the U.K. for the first time.<br/>
<br/>
<h3>Image Playground and Genmoji</h3><br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/08/ios-18-genmoji.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-960703" /><br/>
<em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman said two more Apple Intelligence features that were previewed earlier this year <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/08/ios-18-2-apple-intelligence-features/">will be added in iOS 18.2</a>, including Image Playground for generating images and Genmoji for generating custom emoji.<br/>
<br/>
Here is how Apple describes Image Playground:<blockquote>Produce fun, original images in seconds with the Image Playground experience right in your apps. Create an entirely new image based on a description, suggested concepts, and even a person from your Photos library. You can easily adjust the style and make changes to match a Messages thread, your Freeform board, or a slide in Keynote.</blockquote><br/>
<br/>
Here is how Apple describes Genmoji:<blockquote>Make a brand-new Genmoji right in the keyboard to match any conversation. Provide a description to see a preview, and adjust your description until it's perfect. You can even pick someone from your Photos library and create a Genmoji that looks like them.</blockquote><br/>
<h3>ChatGPT Integration With Siri</h3><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/08/iOS-18-ChatGPT.jpg" alt="" width="1825" height="1027" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-960667" /><br/>
Apple said that ChatGPT will be available through Siri <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/02/ios-18-chatgpt-later-this-year/">before the end of the year</a>, so this integration will likely go live with iOS 18.2.<br/>
<br/>
With user permission, Siri will be able to show ChatGPT answers directly in response to questions and other prompts. ChatGPT will also be an option for Apple's system-wide Writing Tools feature, allowing users to generate text and images. Apple said ChatGPT will be powered by OpenAI's latest GPT-4o model on its platforms.<br/>
<br/>
iPhone, iPad, and Mac users will be able to use ChatGPT for free, without creating an account, and ChatGPT Plus subscribers will be able to connect their accounts to access paid features on these devices. Apple said OpenAI will not store ChatGPT requests made from its devices, and  it said users' IP addresses will be obscured.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>iOS 18.3</h2><br/>
iOS 18.3 is likely to be a minor update released shortly after the U.S. holiday season. It is unclear if this version will add any new Apple Intelligence features.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>iOS 18.4</h2><br/>
<h3>Siri: Personal Context, On-Screen Awareness, and Deeper Per-App Controls</h3><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/iOS-18-Siri-Personal-Context.png" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-955889" /><br/>
<em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman on Thursday <a href="https://x.com/markgurman/status/1834404457649766568">reiterated</a> that Siri's ability to provide more personalized and contextual responses will not be available until March. He previously said that Siri's personal context, on-screen awareness, and deeper per-app controls will be <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/09/ios-18-4-apple-intelligence-powered-siri/">available as part of iOS 18.4</a>, which is expected to be released to the public in March.<br/>
<br/>
<h3>Apple Intelligence in Even More Countries</h3><br/>
Apple said Apple Intelligence will gain support for additional languages — such as Chinese, French, Japanese, and Spanish — next year. This timeframe suggests these languages will be added in iOS 18.4. Another possibility is iOS 18.3, but that update is likely to be a minor one that is released shortly after the U.S. holiday season.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-18/">iPadOS 18</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/">Apple Intelligence</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-18.244">iOS 18</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-18.245">iPadOS 18</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/13/apple-intelligence-features-timing/">Apple Intelligence Features Expected to Roll Out in This Order Between iOS 18.1 and iOS 18.4</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-intelligence-features-expected-to-roll-out-in-this-order-between-ios-18-1-and-ios-18-4.2436225/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today began selling <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/refurbished/ipad/ipad-air-ipad-pro-11-ipad-pro-12-9">certified refurbished 2022 iPad Pro and iPad Air models</a> through its online store in the U.S. for the first time.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/10/iPad-Pro-M2.jpg" alt="" width="1960" height="1306" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-869593" /><br/>
The fourth-generation 11-inch iPad Pro with the M2 chip, sixth-generation 12.9-inch iPad Pro with the M2 chip, and fifth-generation iPad Air with the M1 chip are each available in a variety of storage capacities and color options. The refurbished models are discounted by between 15% and 20% compared to the original pricing of these iPads.<br/>
<br/>
Apple first introduced this particular iPad Air model in March 2022, and the iPad Pro models followed in October of that year.<br/>
<br/>
Apple says its refurbished iPads include a new battery and outer shell, a new white box, and all manuals and accessories, including a USB-C charging cable and power adapter. Apple says it puts refurbished devices through a "thorough cleaning process and inspection," and it performs full functionality testing to ensure there are no defective units.<br/>
<br/>
All refurbished iPads are covered by Apple's one-year limited warranty and 14-day return policy, and eligible for AppleCare+ coverage.<br/>
<br/>
While some savings can be had here, these are obviously two-year-old iPad models with fewer remaining years of iPadOS support.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/">iPad Air </a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-refurbished/">Apple Refurbished Products</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPad-Air">iPad Air (Buy Now)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPad-Pro">iPad Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipad.137">iPad</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/13/refurbished-2022-ipad-pro-and-ipad-air-models/">Apple Begins Selling Refurbished 2022 iPad Pro and iPad Air Models</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-begins-selling-refurbished-2022-ipad-pro-and-ipad-air-models.2436207/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

Apple has the built-in Finder on the Mac for managing the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;, and an app for PCs, but iMazing goes above and beyond what Apple's simple tools can do.<br/>
<br/>
Creating and managing backups is simple with iMazing's backup tools. You can set up automatic backups for hassle-free protection, plus the app supports snapshots so you can browse through your backups to find something specific that you're looking for. Backups are encrypted and can be saved to any computer, a local storage setup, or an external drive.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/imazing-main-image.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-965962" /><br/>
The Device overview provides detailed information on your &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; in one spot, and it gives you a quick way to make a backup and access other iMazing capabilities. You can see information like serial number, model number, device ID, and stored data, plus there's a section for battery management that shows details on temperature, max charge, and charge cycles.<br/>
<br/>
iMazing can be used to transfer photos, music, movies, and other media and files from your computer to your &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; and vice versa. It's a great way to move photos from one device to another, and it's ideal if you have music files rather than a streaming service. With Quick Transfer, you can even drag and drop files and folders to your &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; and choose an iOS app to transfer the file to.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/imazing-device-overview.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-965963" /><br/>
Apple has no way to get your messages off of your &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;, but iMazing can create an entire archive from the Messages app or WhatsApp, and it works for SMS/MMS messages and iMessages. You can save your messages into a PDF, an Excel document, or use other file formats.<br/>
<br/>
With so many &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; management tools available, iMazing can be overwhelming, but the app has a Discover Section that offers quick access to the features that iMazing has to offer. There's also an in-app product tour and the simple interface makes tasks easy.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/imazing-discover-section.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-965965" /><br/>
iMazing can be used by businesses for advanced device management too, and it supports provisioning, configuring, and streamlining MDM enrollment for fleets of Apple devices. The Devices screen offers an organized view of all of your Apple devices, and it provides bulk control options.<br/>

iMazing was overhauled with an updated design <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/24/imazing-3-update-vision-pro/">earlier this year</a>, along with Vision Pro support. You can use iMazing to manage iPhones, iPads, and Apple's headset. The app can be <a href="https://imazing.com">downloaded from the iMazing website</a> at prices starting at &#36;35, and there are both one-time purchase options and yearly subscriptions. iMazing also offers free trials, and some functions are free even without a purchase.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[On this week's episode of <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/podcast/new-airpods-apple-watches-and-iphones-announced-event/id1602394741?i=1000669451225">The MacRumors Show</a>, we talk through all of the major announcements from Apple's "<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/september-2024-apple-event/">It's Glowtime</a>" event.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uy8O7JBhVTE?si=gOsO4xgt-fZHWNJB" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@themacrumorsshow?sub_confirmation=1">Subscribe to The MacRumors Show YouTube channel</a> for more videos</em></div><br/>
The long-awaited unveiling of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a> lineup was the main announcement at the event, so we break down some of the major features coming to the new devices. For the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone-15-vs-iphone-16/">iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus</a>, this includes the A18 chip with support for Apple Intelligence, the Action button, faster charging, revamped Photographic Styles, and the all-new Camera Control button. The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone-15-pro-vs-iphone-16-pro/">iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max</a> take things further with larger display size options with slimmer bezels, a 48-megapixel Ultra Wide camera, improved audio recording, and a significant battery life boost.<br/>
<br/>
We discuss the Apple Watch Series 10 and new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/09/apple-watch-ultra-satin-black-milanese-loop/">Satin Black color option</a> for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch-ultra/">Apple Watch Ultra 2</a>. The Series 10 features redesigned casings and larger screen sizes, a new wide-angle OLED display with a faster refresh rate for an improved experience in always-on mode, sleep apnea detection, a water temperature sensor and depth gauge, a speaker with media playback, and faster charging.<br/>
<br/>
We also take a look at the fourth-generation AirPods with Active Noise Cancellation and the new hearing protection, testing, and aid features for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/">AirPods Pro</a> 2. Apple also brought a minor update to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-max/">AirPods Max</a> that switches Lightning for USB-C and refreshes its selection of color options.<br/>
<br/>
Finally, we weigh up the event as a whole and take a look forward at some of the early rumors for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17/">iPhone 17</a> lineup to consider who should upgrade this year and who may be better off waiting until next year. <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/the-macrumors-show/">The MacRumors Show</a> has <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@themacrumorsshow">its own YouTube channel</a>, so make sure you're subscribed to keep up with new episodes and clips:<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple has <a href="https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=4sn7e783">announced</a> it will allow iPad apps to be sold via third-party app stores in the European Union from Monday, September 16, coinciding with the release of iPadOS 18. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/App-Store-vs-EU-Feature-2.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-932826" /><br/>
The move follows Apple's tolerance in the bloc for alternative app stores on iPhones, which happened earlier this year in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/06/app-store-safari-and-ios-designated-gatekeepers/">compliance</a> with the EU's Digital Markets Act (DMA).<br/>
<br/>
Apple's iPad operating system was designated by the European Commission as a "core platform service" in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/29/eu-says-ipados-digital-gatekeeper-dma/">April</a> under the rules of the DMA, joining iOS, the App Store, and Safari.<br/>
<br/>
Although iPadOS user numbers fell below the threshold for inclusion under the DMA, the Commission retains some flexibility in its designations and noted significant lock-in effects, especially for business users. The Commission gave Apple six months to update iPadOS and make it compliant with the DMA. Apple later <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/02/ipados-eu-app-changes-fall/">confirmed</a> that it would bring all of the app ecosystem changes made to iOS in the European Union to iPadOS in the fall.<br/>
<br/>
After installing iPadOS 18, iPad users in the EU will be able to install alternative app stores, while developers will be able to release alternative browsers based on their own browser engines, instead of Apple's WebKit.<br/>
<br/>
Currently there are a handful of third-party app marketplaces available to iPhone users in the EU. One of them, Epic Games, has already said that it plans to bring Fortnite and its other games to iPad. Other enforced changes include allowing users to delete Apple's pre-loaded apps, and choose alternative default apps, including browsers. <div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/european-union/">European Union</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/european-commission/">European Commission</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/13/apple-ipados-eu-third-party-stores/">Apple to Allow iPad Users in EU to Download Apps From Third-Party App Stores From September 16</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-to-allow-ipad-users-in-eu-to-download-apps-from-third-party-app-stores-from-september-16.2436183/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple has started notifying users about an upcoming revision to its iCloud Terms and Conditions, which takes effect on Monday, September 16.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/06/iCloud-General-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2250" height="1266" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-803318" /><br/>
We compared the text of the upcoming iCloud Terms and Conditions with the <a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/icloud/">current U.S. version</a> from September 18, 2023 and identified four key changes:<br/>
<br/>
<ul><li>"Apple ID" references have been <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/11/apple-id-renamed-to-apple-account/">changed to "Apple Account"</a> throughout.</li><br/>
<li>iCloud users must agree to not "engage in any activity that exploits, harms or threatens children in any way, including without limitation producing, sharing, uploading or storing Child Sexual Abuse Material (CSAM)."</li><br/>
<li>A clause was added about statutory rights under Australian consumer law.</li><br/>
<li>"Effective October 26, 2024, for users in Bhutan, Brunei, Cambodia, Fiji, Laos, Macau, Maldives, Micronesia, Mongolia, Myanmar, Nauru, Nepal, Palau, Papua New Guinea, South Korea, Sri Lanka, Solomon Islands, Tonga, and Vanuatu, 'Apple' means Apple Services Pte. Ltd., located in Singapore. Prior to October 26, 2024, 'Apple' means Apple Distribution International Ltd. for such users."</li></ul><br/>
<br/>
The list of changes above is not comprehensive, and this article is not intended to provide any legal advice. Please read Apple's revised iCloud Terms and Conditions in full yourself before deciding if you will agree to them.<br/>
<br/>
September 16 is the same day that Apple will be releasing iOS 18, macOS Sequoia, watchOS 11, and other software updates.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/icloud/">iCloud</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-music-apple-pay-card-icloud-fitness.134">Apple Music, Apple Pay/Card, iCloud, Fitness+</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/13/apple-updating-icloud-terms-and-conditions/">Here&#039;s What&#039;s New in Apple&#039;s Updated iCloud Terms and Conditions Taking Effect Next Week</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/heres-whats-new-in-apples-updated-icloud-terms-and-conditions-taking-effect-next-week.2436180/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The Apple Watch Series 10 is now available for pre-order. The latest models feature 18 upgrades over their predecessors, so here's everything that's changed.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/08/Apple-Watch-Series-9-vs-Series-10-Buyers-Guide-2-Mock.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-963174" /><br/>
Apple's latest Apple Watch models bring range of small improvements along with the first design refresh in three years. Some of the most significant hardware changes include new display technologies, water temperature and depth sensing, and a reengineered metal back that allows for faster charging.<br/>
<br/>
But beyond these headline features, how much of an improvement does the ‌Apple Watch Series 10‌ really offer? This guide breaks down the differences between the Series 9 and ‌Series 10 models to help you understand all of the changes and determine whether these enhancements are enough to justify making the switch from a Series 9‌.<br/>

<h4>Dimensions</h4><br/>
The Series 10 introduces slight increases in height and width, resulting in a marginally larger screen-to-body ratio. However, the depth is significantly reduced by over 9%, making the Series 10 noticeably thinner. Despite the larger case sizes, the Series 10 is lighter across both aluminium GPS and GPS + Cellular models.<br/>

<h3 id="release_date">Release Date</h3><br/>
The Apple Watch Series 10 is now available for pre-order, with availability beginning Friday, September 20.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="is_it_worth_upgrading">Is It Worth Upgrading?</h2><br/>
The Apple Watch Series 10 brings several enhancements over the Series 9, but for most users, the differences are incremental. The thinner and lighter design is an improvement, but it doesn't fundamentally alter the device's overall appearance or experience. The slightly larger display and wide-angle OLED, while improving readability, isn't a drastic change.<br/>
<br/>
The improved speaker and microphone on the Series 10 are also worth noting as minor upgrades. The new speaker can playback media for the first time and the microphone now features voice isolation, improving call clarity in noisy environments. <br/>
<br/>
One of the more significant changes is the faster charging. The Series 10 charges to 80% in around 30 minutes, compared to 45 minutes for the Series 9, which could be a noteworthy improvement for users who frequently need quick charges. Additionally, the Series 10 introduces new finishes, including a polished Jet Black aluminum and polished titanium options, offering a more premium aesthetic.<br/>
<br/>
While the Series 10 does bring some useful upgrades, like water depth and temperature sensing, faster charging and improved audio quality, most of these enhancements feel like refinements rather than essential upgrades. Unless you're particularly drawn to the refreshed design and display improvements, the faster charging, new water features, or the speaker and microphone improvements, it's hard to justify upgrading from the Series 9. For most users, the differences won't significantly impact their daily use, making the Series 10 an upgrade only for those with very specific needs or preferences.<br/>
<br/>
Those with a much older Apple Watch will have much better reason to upgrade, with the improvements of successive Apple Watch generations, such as body temperature sensing and the Double Tap gesture, stacking up for a more substantial overall difference. <div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch/">Apple Watch 10</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch">Apple Watch (Buy Now)</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-watch-series-9-vs-10/">Apple Watch Series 9 vs. Series 10 Buyer&#039;s Guide: 18 Upgrades Compared</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-watch-series-9-vs-series-10-buyers-guide-18-upgrades-compared.2434825/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

You'll find both Wi-Fi and cellular tablets on sale at Best Buy, with a particular focus on the larger capacity 1TB and 2TB models. All deals listed below represent record low prices on each iPad Pro model, and many of them can currently only be found at Best Buy.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple began <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/13/iphone-16-preorders-now-available/">accepting pre-orders for all four new iPhone 16 models</a> today, and shipping estimates for the iPhone 16 Pro and Pro Max on Apple's online store in the U.S. are already beginning to slip into October for many configurations.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/iphone-16-pro-apple-intelligence.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-964666" /><br/>
As of 6:45 a.m. Pacific Time, the iPhone 16 Pro and Pro Max were facing a 2-4 week shipping delay for some configurations on Apple's online store, with delivery estimates stretching as far out as October 14. The lower-end iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus were largely still available for launch-day delivery on Friday, September 20 as of that time.<br/>
<br/>
Inventory will inevitably continue to tighten for both delivery and Apple Store pickup as the day progresses, so order quickly if you are planning to.<br/>
<br/>
iPhone 16 Pro models have several new features, including larger 6.3-inch and 6.9-inch displays with thinner bezels, longer battery life, a new Camera Control button for quick access to camera functions, a 48-megapixel Ultra Wide camera, a faster A18 Pro chip, Wi-Fi 7 support, faster 5G, faster charging, and more. Both of the devices support Apple Intelligence, which will <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/09/ios-18-1-available-in-october/">begin rolling out with iOS 18.1 in October</a>. Apple Intelligence is also coming to the iPhone 15 Pro models, iPhone 16, and iPhone 16 Plus.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/">iPhone 16 Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-16-Pro">iPhone 16 Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/13/iphone-16-pro-max-now-shipping-in-october/">iPhone 16 Pro and Pro Max Shipping Estimates Extending Into October</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-16-pro-and-pro-max-shipping-estimates-extending-into-october.2436161/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple is now accepting orders for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a>, &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; Plus, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/">iPhone 16 Pro</a>, and &zwnj;iPhone 16 Pro&zwnj; Max through its online storefront and through the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-store/">Apple Store</a> app. The &zwnj;Apple Store&zwnj; app is often the quickest way to get a pre-order in as typically comes online ahead of the website.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/iPhone-16-Pre-Orders-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-965805" /><br/>
Pre-orders are being accepted in more than 58 countries and regions around the world, and if you used Apple's "Get Ready" feature ahead of time, you should be able to get your order in with a few taps.<br/>
<br/>
Pricing on the &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; starts at &#36;799 in the United States, while pricing on the &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; Plus starts at &#36;899. The &zwnj;iPhone 16 Pro&zwnj; is priced starting at &#36;999, and the &zwnj;iPhone 16 Pro&zwnj; Max starts at &#36;1,199. Note that the &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj;, &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; Plus, and &zwnj;iPhone 16 Pro&zwnj; start with 128GB of storage, but the Pro Max starts at 256GB.<br/>
<br/>
&zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; prices vary by country, and go up with increased storage space. The 16 and 16 Plus support up to 512GB, while the 16 Pro and Pro Max support up to 1TB storage space. Apple is encouraging customers to use trade-in credits to lower the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>'s price, and it is promoting carrier deals from AT&T, Verizon, and T-Mobile in the U.S.<br/>
<br/>
All four &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; models feature the new Camera Control button for taking photos and video, and have chips capable of supporting the Apple Intelligence features coming in a future <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a> update. Other features include the Action Button, faster 5G, faster <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe-battery-pack/">MagSafe</a> and USB-C charging, Wi-Fi 7, longer battery life, and new color options.<br/>
<br/>

The &zwnj;iPhone 16 Pro&zwnj; models have been updated with larger displays with slimmer bezels while &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; display size hasn't changed. The &zwnj;iPhone 16 Pro&zwnj; has a 6.3-inch display, while the &zwnj;iPhone 16 Pro&zwnj; Max has a 6.9-inch display. Other "Pro" features include a more advanced A18 chip, support for ProMotion and Always-On display technology, along with a 48-megapixel Ultra Wide lens and a 5x Telephoto lens, which is now available across both models.<br/>
<br/>

We haven't heard rumors of production shortages, so it is not clear what supplies will look like. It is a good idea to pre-order right away just in case some models sell out, especially in the new Desert Titanium &zwnj;iPhone 16 Pro&zwnj; color.<br/>
<br/>

In addition to Apple, U.S. carriers like Verizon, AT&amp;T, and T-Mobile are accepting pre-orders starting now, as are carriers worldwide. Big box retailers like Best Buy, Target, and Walmart are also selling the new &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; models.<br/>
<br/>
Customers who pre-order an &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; or &zwnj;iPhone 16 Pro&zwnj; can expect to begin receiving their new devices on Friday, September 20, which is the official &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; launch date.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/">iPhone 16 Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-16">iPhone 16 (Buy Now)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-16-Pro">iPhone 16 Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/13/iphone-16-preorders-now-available/">iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Pro Models Now Available for Pre-Order</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-16-and-iphone-16-pro-models-now-available-for-pre-order.2436150/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<title>New Voice Memos Multitrack Recording Feature Seemingly Exclusive to iPhone 16 Pro</title>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple during its iPhone event earlier this week unveiled a significant upgrade to its Voice Memos app, introducing multitrack recording capabilities that appear to be exclusively for the iPhone 16 Pro and Pro Max models. The new feature marks a notable advancement in mobile audio recording, but it appears it will be unavailable for older iPhones or the standard iPhone 16.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/voice-memos-multitrack.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-965867" /><br/>
Essentially, the multitrack functionality allows iPhone 16 Pro users to layer one audio track on top of an existing recording, a capability that is likely to be particularly attractive to musicians and songwriters. Users can record an initial track, for example a guitar part, and then add a vocal or another instrument as an overdub.<br/>
<br/>
The way it works is that the Voice Memos app plays the music track through the iPhone's speakers, while simultaneously recording the user's voice. It can then isolate the overdubbed part using what Apple calls "advanced processing" and cancel the background music, leaving a "professional-sounding recording" without the need for headphones. This means users can effectively separate the layers for individual use or editing.<br/>
<br/>
The update addresses a long-standing limitation of the Voice Memos app, which has been a popular tool for quickly capturing musical ideas despite its previously basic functionality. But the feature limitation to Apple's premium Pro models may come as an unwelcome surprise to some.<br/>
<br/>
While Apple hasn't detailed the specific technical requirements that make it exclusive to iPhone 16 Pro models, it's likely that the feature leverages the enhanced processing power of the new A18 Pro chip and the devices' new four studio-quality microphones. The iPhone 16 series launches on September 20, with pre-orders starting on Friday, September 13, but the multitrack recording feature is expected to be available later in the year via a software update. <div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/">iPhone 16 Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-16-Pro">iPhone 16 Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/13/multitrack-recording-voice-memos-iphone-16-pro/">New Voice Memos Multitrack Recording Feature Seemingly Exclusive to iPhone 16 Pro</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/new-voice-memos-multitrack-recording-feature-seemingly-exclusive-to-iphone-16-pro.2436148/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Ahead of iPhone 16 pre-orders starting on Friday, Apple has shared three videos touting the benefits of iPhone 16 Pro with Apple Intelligence, with special reference to the Mail app, Photos app, and enhanced Siri.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/email-summary-apple-intelligence.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="720" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-965856" /><br/>
Apple describes the trio of short videos, all of which star English actor Isabella Ramsey, in the following way:<br/>
<ul><br/>
  <li><strong><a href="https://youtu.be/EcHUOKPDMFU?si=D99tRbJcgGTqtuU0">Custom memory</a>:</strong> Create a custom memory movie by entering a description in Photos, and Apple Intelligence will find the best photos and videos to craft a storyline with its own narrative arc.</li><br/>
  <li><strong><a href="https://youtu.be/_eJy6QyHaFM?si=kn9cB49-Dlo4VVHP">Email summary</a>:</strong> Tap to reveal a summary of a long email in the Mail app and cut to the chase. You can also view summaries of emails right from your inbox.</li><br/>
  <li><strong><a href="https://youtu.be/TPe8revsg3k?si=BDs0I99kVQjAGFCC">More personal Siri</a>:</strong> Equipped with awareness of your personal context, the ability to take action in and across apps, and richer language understanding, Siri will be able to assist you like never before.</li><br/>
</ul><br/>

Apple plans to introduce the first Apple Intelligence features with the release of iOS 18.1, which is expected to launch in October. Among the new capabilities are writing tools for generating and summarizing text, as well as a feature that provides concise summaries of notifications. <br/>
<br/>
The Messages app will gain the ability to suggest replies, while a new function will allow users to record and transcribe phone calls. The Photos app will benefit from a new "Clean Up" tool, which is designed to swiftly remove unwanted objects from images.<br/>
<br/>
Apple plans to make the Image Playground feature for generating images and the Genmoji feature for generating custom emoji available in iOS 18.2, which will likely be released in December. <div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/">iPhone 16 Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/">Apple Intelligence</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-16-Pro">iPhone 16 Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/13/apple-iphone-16-pro-apple-intelligence-ads/">Apple Shares Videos Showcasing iPhone 16 Pro With Apple Intelligence</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-shares-videos-showcasing-iphone-16-pro-with-apple-intelligence.2436144/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's iPhone development roadmap runs several years into the future and the company is continually working with suppliers on several successive iPhone models simultaneously, which is why we sometimes get rumored feature leaks so far ahead of launch. The iPhone 17 series is no different – already we have some idea of what to expect from Apple's 2025 smartphone lineup.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/04/Beyond-iPhone-13-Better-Blue-Face-ID-Single-Camera-Hole.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-891051" /><br/>
If you plan to skip this year's iPhone 16, or if you're just plain curious about what's on the horizon, here are 10 rumored features that we are expecting to arrive in time for its successor, the iPhone 17 series, which is likely to be released in September 2025.<br/>
<br><br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px; color: #4A90E2; margin-top: 2px;">1. Under-Display Face ID</span><br><br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 14px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #4A90E2; padding: 3px 6px; border-radius: 4px; margin-bottom: 2px;">iPhone 17 Pro & iPhone 17 Pro Max</span><br><br/>
The iPhone 17 Pro is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/03/under-display-face-id-to-debut-on-iphone-17-pro/">expected</a> to be the first ‌iPhone‌ to feature under-panel Face ID technology. The only external indication of the under-display ‌Face ID‌ technology will likely be a circular cutout for the front-facing camera. This will probably be Apple's last premium model to include a circular cutout for the front-facing camera. Apple is then <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/06/iphone-under-display-camera/">expected</a> adopt under-display cameras in 2027's "Pro" ‌iPhone‌ models for a true "all-screen" appearance.<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px; color: #4A90E2; margin-top: 2px;"><br/>
    2. New Display Sizes</span><br><br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 14px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #4A90E2; padding: 3px 6px; border-radius: 4px; margin-bottom: 2px;">iPhone 17 & iPhone 17 Plus</span><br><br/>
This year's iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max got bigger display sizes, going from 6.12- and 6.69-inches to 6.27- and 6.86-inches, respectively. For 2025, Apple is also expected to bring the larger 6.27-inch display size to its standard ‌iPhone‌ model, while the equivalent "iPhone 17 Plus" model could adopt <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/06/iphone-17-slim-rumor/">completely new display dimensions</a>. <br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px; color: #4A90E2; margin-top: 2px;"><br/>
    3. 120Hz ProMotion (Always-on Display)</span><br><br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 14px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #4A90E2; padding: 3px 6px; border-radius: 4px; margin-bottom: 2px;">iPhone 17 & iPhone 17 Plus</span><br><br/>
Apple intends to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/03/promotion-standard-iphones-2025/">expand</a> ProMotion to its standard models in 2025, allowing them to ramp up to a 120Hz refresh rate for smoother scrolling and video content when necessary. Notably, ProMotion would also enable the display on the iPhone 17 and iPhone 17 Plus to ramp down to a more power-efficient refresh rate as low as 1Hz, allowing for an always-on display that can show the Lock Screen's clock, widgets, notifications, and wallpaper even when the device is locked.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px; color: #4A90E2; margin-top: 2px;">4. Apple-Designed Wi-Fi 7 Chip</span><br><br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 14px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #4A90E2; padding: 3px 6px; border-radius: 4px; margin-bottom: 2px;">iPhone 17 Pro & iPhone 17 Pro Max</span><br><br/>
Apple's premium 2025 models are <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/15/iphone-17-pro-apple-wifi-7-chip-rumor/">expected</a> to be equipped with an Apple-designed Wi-Fi 7 chip for the first time. Wi-Fi 7 support would allow the "Pro" models to send and receive data over the 2.4GHz, 5GHz, and 6GHz bands simultaneously with a supported router, resulting in faster Wi-Fi speeds, lower latency, and more reliable connectivity. The Wi-Fi chip would also allow Apple to further reduce its dependance on external suppliers like Broadcom, which currently supplies Apple with a combined Wi-Fi and Bluetooth chip for iPhones.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px; color: #4A90E2; margin-top: 2px;">5. 48MP Telephoto Lens</span><br><br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 14px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #4A90E2; padding: 3px 6px; border-radius: 4px; margin-bottom: 2px;">iPhone 17 Pro Max</span><br><br/>
An upgraded 48-megapixel Telephoto lens on Apple's largest premium device is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/15/iphone-17-pro-max-48mp-telephoto-lens-rumor/">expected</a> to be optimized for use with Apple's Vision Pro headset. That would make 2025's "Pro Max" the first iPhone to have a rear camera system composed entirely of 48-megapixel lenses, making it capable of capturing even more photographic detail.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px; color: #4A90E2; margin-top: 2px;">6. 24MP Selfie Camera</span><br><br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 14px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #4A90E2; padding: 3px 6px; border-radius: 4px; margin-bottom: 2px;">All iPhone 17 Models</span><br><br/>
The iPhone 17 lineup will feature a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/04/kuo-iphone-17-to-feature-24mp-front-facing-camera/">24-megapixel front-facing camera</a> with a six-element lens, according to one rumor. The iPhone 14 and 15 feature a 12-megapixel front-facing camera with five plastic lens elements, and this year's iPhone 16 lineup features the same hardware. The upgraded resolution to 24 megapixels on the iPhone 17 will allow photos to maintain their quality even when cropped or zoomed in, while the larger number of pixels will capture finer details. The upgrade to a six-element lens should also slightly enhance image quality. <br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px; color: #4A90E2; margin-top: 2px;">7. Scratch Resistant Anti-Reflective Display</span><br><br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 14px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #4A90E2; padding: 3px 6px; border-radius: 4px; margin-bottom: 2px;">All iPhone 17 Models</span><br><br/>
The iPhone 17 will feature an anti-reflective display that is more scratch-resistant than Apple's Ceramic Shield found on iPhone 15 models, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/19/iphone-17-anti-reflective-display/">according to one rumor</a>, although the new iPhone 16 Pro models do have the latest-generation Ceramic Shield, which has an advanced formulation that is 2x tougher than glass on any other smartphone. The outer glass on the iPhone 17 is said to have a "super-hard anti-reflective layer" that is "more scratch-resistant." It's not clear whether Apple is planning to adopt the Gorilla Glass Armor that Samsung uses in its Galaxy S24 Ultra, but the description of Corning's latest technology matches the rumor.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px; color: #4A90E2; margin-top: 2px;">8. More Memory</span><br><br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 14px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #4A90E2; padding: 3px 6px; border-radius: 4px; margin-bottom: 2px;">iPhone 17 Pro & iPhone 17 Pro Max</span><br><br/>
At least one model in Apple's iPhone 17 lineup will come with 12GB. <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/06/iphone-17-pro-12gb-ram-rumor/">Jeff Pu</a> of investment firm Haitong has claimed that both Pro models will come with the upped RAM, while Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo believes only the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/28/kuo-12gb-ram-iphone-17-pro-max-exclusive/">iPhone 17 Pro Max will feature 12GB</a>. In contrast, another <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/28/iphone-17-feature-12gb-ram-up-from-8gb/">reliable source</a> has claimed that all iPhone 17 models will have 12GB of RAM. For comparison, the standard iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus have 6GB of RAM, and the iPhone 15 Pro models have 8GB of RAM, while all iPhone 16 models have 8GB of RAM. Any such increase would allow for improved multitasking on the iPhone, as well as provide additional resources for Apple Intelligence features that require large-language models to be resident in memory.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px; color: #4A90E2; margin-top: 2px;">9. Smaller Dynamic Island</span><br><br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 14px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #4A90E2; padding: 3px 6px; border-radius: 4px; margin-bottom: 2px;">iPhone 17 Pro Max</span><br><br/>
Apple's highest-end 2025 iPhone will feature a significantly narrower Dynamic Island, thanks to the device's adoption of a smaller "metalens" for the Face ID system, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/06/iphone-17-pro-12gb-ram-rumor/">claims</a> Haitong's Jeff Pu. Assuming that's the case, it would be the first time that Apple has changed the Dynamic Island since it debuted on the iPhone 14 Pro in 2022.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px; color: #4A90E2; margin-top: 2px;">10. iPhone 17 "Air" </span><br><br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 14px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #4A90E2; padding: 3px 6px; border-radius: 4px; margin-bottom: 2px;">iPhone 17 Plus</span><br><br/>
Apple plans to launch an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/05/iphone-17-slim-everything-we-know/">all-new iPhone 17 model</a> with a "significantly thinner" design, reports <em><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/17/slim-iphone-17-top-center-cameras-rumor/">The Information</a></em>. The device, which could be called "<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/12/slim-iphone-17-could-be-iphone-air/">iPhone 17 Air</a>," will allegedly feature a "major redesign" that could feature a single rear camera located at the top-center of the device, along with a narrower Dynamic Island, according to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/24/kuo-ultra-thin-iphone-17-specs/">Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo</a>. The device is rumored to have a 6.5-inch display size, and may replace the iPhone 17 Plus model. Other potential features include an aluminum chassis, an A19 chip, an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/24/kuo-iphone-se-4-thin-iphone-17-apple-5g-chip/">Apple-designed 5G modem</a>, and an improved front camera.

		<description><![CDATA[As <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/apple-vision-pro-persona-eye-tracking-spy-typing/">reported by <em>WIRED</em></a> today, a group of six computer scientists this year discovered a security vulnerability with the Apple Vision Pro that allowed them to reconstruct what people were typing, including passwords, PINs, and messages.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/visionOS-Virtual-Keyboard.jpg" alt="" width="1622" height="910" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-898918" /><br/>
When a Vision Pro user was using a virtual Persona avatar, such as during a FaceTime call, the researchers were able to analyze the Persona's eye movement or "gaze" to determine what the user was typing on the headset's virtual keyboard. The researchers created a website with technical details about the so-called <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/Gazeploit/">"GAZEploit"</a> vulnerability.<br/>
<br/>
In short, the researchers said that a person's gaze typically fixates on a key they are likely to press next, and this can reveal some common patterns. As a result, the researchers said they were able to identify the correct letters people typed in messages 92% of the time within five guesses, and 77% of the time for passwords.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/dan-persona-vision-pro.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-934314" /><br/>
The researchers disclosed the vulnerability to Apple in April, according to the report, and the company addressed the issue in visionOS 1.3 in July. The update suspends Personas when the Vision Pro's virtual keyboard is active.<br/>
<br/>
Apple added the following entry to its <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/120915">visionOS 1.3 security notes</a> on September 5:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><strong>Presence</strong><br/>
<br/>
Available for: Apple Vision Pro<br/>
<br/>
Impact: Inputs to the virtual keyboard may be inferred from Persona<br/>
<br/>
Description: The issue was addressed by suspending Persona when the virtual keyboard is active.<br/>
<br/>
CVE-2024-40865: Hanqiu Wang of University of Florida, Zihao Zhan of Texas Tech University, Haoqi Shan of Certik, Siqi Dai of University of Florida, Max Panoff of University of Florida, and Shuo Wang of University of Florida</blockquote>The proof-of-concept attack was not exploited in the wild, according to the report. Nonetheless, Vision Pro users should immediately update the headset to visionOS 1.3 or later to ensure they are protected, now that the findings have been shared publicly.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/visionos/">visionOS</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/visionos-2/">visionOS 2</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AppleVisionPro">Vision Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-vision-pro.209">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/12/vision-pro-persona-typing-security-vulnerability/">Apple Fixes Vision Pro Security Flaw That Could Expose What You Typed</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-fixes-vision-pro-security-flaw-that-could-expose-what-you-typed.2436088/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Amazon today has a few all-time low prices on the 10th generation iPad and 6th generation iPad mini. Both of these discounts represent all-time low prices on each tablet, and prices start at <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0BJLT98Q7%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"><strong>&#36;299.00</strong></a> for the 64GB Wi-Fi iPad, down from &#36;349.00.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>iPad</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/new-ipad-blue.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-940260" /><em><small>Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with Amazon. When you click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment, which helps us keep the site running.</small></em><br/>
<br/>
For the 10th generation iPad, Amazon provides an estimated September 14 - 17 delivery estimate for most orders placed in the United States. Right now we're only tracking record low prices on the 64GB Wi-Fi model, but you can find a few solid second-best prices on the other configurations as well.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0BJLT98Q7%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"target="_blank"><div class="fancybutton"><div class="fancybadge">&#36;50 OFF</div>iPad (64GB Wi-Fi) for &#36;299.00</div></a></div><br/>
<br/>
This iPad launched in October 2022 and was completely redesigned compared to the 9th generation model. It features a larger 10.9-inch display, USB-C port, A14 Bionic chip, 12-megapixel camera, Touch ID, and more.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>iPad Mini</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/new-ipad-mini-blue.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-940258" /><br/>
<br/>
iPad mini 6 prices start at <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB09G91LXFP%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"><strong>&#36;379.99</strong></a> for the 64GB Wi-Fi model, down from &#36;499.00. Similar to the iPad, only the 64GB Wi-Fi iPad mini is seeing a match of its record low price, but you can still find a few second-best prices on other models.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB09G91LXFP%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"target="_blank"><div class="fancybutton"><div class="fancybadge">&#36;119 OFF</div>iPad mini (64GB Wi-Fi) for &#36;379.99</div></a></div><br/>

<br/>
Steep discounts on the iPad mini 6 have become more frequent recently as we're expecting a refresh of the tablet at some point soon, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/06/new-ipad-mini-rumored-for-october/">possibly during an event next month</a>. The iPad mini is Apple's smallest tablet device and this model features a slim-bezeled design, the A15 Bionic chip, a USB-C port, and Apple Pencil 2 support.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Some <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> owners who have the iOS 18.1 beta installed appear to be experiencing issues with the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a> personal assistant, which has stopped working sometime over the course of the last couple of days.<br/>

There are multiple reports from people experiencing issues on social media, as noted by <em><a href="https://9to5mac.com/2024/09/12/siri-not-working-ios-18-1-beta/">9to5Mac</a></em>, as well as <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/iOSBeta/comments/1fdyf9j/ios_181_db3_siri_not_available_wont_redownload/">complaints on Reddit</a> and <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-18-1-beta-3-bug-fixes-changes-and-improvements.2434612/page-15">the <em>MacRumors</em> forums</a>. Impacted users are seeing a "&zwnj;Siri&zwnj; Not Available" banner when attempting to use &zwnj;Siri&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
The banner says that "Data for &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; is downloading" or that users need to "Connect to Wi-Fi to complete &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; download." Either way, no download completes as it seems to get stuck at 99 percent, and &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; remains unavailable.<br/>
<br/>
Not all users who are running iOS 18.1 are impacted, and restarting does not fix the problem. Turning off Apple Intelligence allows the old version of &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; to work, but toggling it off and on again also does not address the issue.<br/>
<br/>
It is not clear what happened with &zwnj;Siri&zwnj;, but it is worth noting that iOS 18.1 is a beta and there are often bugs in betas, which is why caution should be used when installing beta software. Apple will likely push out a fix for the problem in the near future.<br/>
<br/>
For now, if you need &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; access and are running iOS 18.1, temporarily turn off Apple Intelligence. <div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-18/">iPadOS 18</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-18.244">iOS 18</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-18.245">iPadOS 18</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/12/ios-18-1-siri-not-working-for-some/">Siri Not Working for Some iOS 18.1 Beta Users</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/siri-not-working-for-some-ios-18-1-beta-users.2436077/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>
