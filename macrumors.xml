		<description><![CDATA[Apple this "past summer" canceled the development of a high-performance Mac chip that would have consisted of four smaller chips stitched together, in order to free up engineering resources for a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/11/apple-intelligence-servers-new-chip-report/">planned AI server chip</a>, according <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/apple-is-working-on-ai-chip-with-broadcom">to <em>The Information</em></a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/12/M4-Extreme-Cancelled.jpg" alt="" width="2313" height="1301" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-981659" /><br/>
Based on the report's description of the chip, it sounds like Apple has canceled a previously-rumored "Extreme" chip for the Mac. It was previously reported that an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/12/18/mac-pro-m2-extreme-chip-likely-scrapped/">"M2 Extreme" chip was scrapped</a> a few years ago, but perhaps Apple had revisited the idea since then. In any case, it now sounds like an "M4 Extreme" chip is also unlikely.<br/>
<br/>
Apple likely would have introduced the "M4 Extreme" in its high-end Mac Pro tower. The chip would have offered even faster performance than the M4 Ultra chip that is expected to launch in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/07/m4-mac-studio-m4-mac-pro-2025/">new Mac Studio and Mac Pro models</a> later next year.<br/>
<br/>
If the "M4 Extreme" were to have been a quadrupled version of the M4 Max chip that debuted in the MacBook Pro a few months ago, it would have had massive specifications, including up to a 64-core CPU and up to a 160-core GPU.<br/>
<br/>
While the "Extreme" chip may be off the table once again, it seems like Apple has repeatedly shown interest in developing such a chip, so perhaps it will eventually materialize as part of the M5 series or later. For now, though, the wait continues.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-pro/">Mac Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/theinformation-com/">The Information</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Mac_Pro">Mac Pro (Neutral)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/mac-pro.1">Mac Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/11/m4-extreme-chip-unlikely/">&#039;M4 Extreme&#039; Chip Unlikely After Apple &#039;Cancels&#039; High-Performance Chip</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/m4-extreme-chip-unlikely-after-apple-cancels-high-performance-chip.2445107/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Developers now have access to cloud-based M4 and M4 Pro <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-mini/">Mac mini</a> units via <a href="https://www.macweb.com/macmini">MacWeb</a>, a Silicon Valley-based provider of cloud services.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/11/m4-mac-mini-hands-on.jpg" alt="" width="3840" height="2160" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-976377" /><br/>
The company has launched <a href="https://www.macweb.com/macmini">three configurations</a> of the new &zwnj;Mac mini&zwnj;, powered by Apple's M4 and M4 Pro chips. Developers and IT teams can rent these machines for tasks ranging from basic development to advanced artificial intelligence modeling, providing an efficient and scalable infrastructure option without the need to purchase expensive hardware outright. A new &zwnj;Mac mini&zwnj; can range from &#36;599 for a base M4 model to &#36;1,999 for a high-end M4 Pro model with 64GB of unified memory. <br/>
<br/>
The three configurations include the MacWeb Base M4 at &#36;99 per month, the MacWeb Power M4 Pro at &#36;199 per month, and the MacWeb Ultimate M4 Pro at &#36;299 per month. The Base M4, featuring the standard M4 chip, is designed for virtual desktops and small-scale tasks. The Power M4 Pro includes a 12-core CPU and 24GB of unified memory, making it suitable for application development and testing. The Ultimate M4 Pro, MacWeb's most advanced tier, offers a 14-core CPU, a 20-core GPU, and 64GB of unified memory, capable of handling intensive workloads such as AI model training and mission-critical applications.<br/>
<br/>
MacWeb touts the potential of its M4 Pro configurations to support advanced networking capabilities using Thunderbolt 5. According to the company, Thunderbolt 5 delivers 80 Gbps of bi-directional bandwidth, a performance leap described as being up to 800 percent faster than 10G Ethernet. This apparently enables seamless clustering of Mac minis, allowing users to pool resources for distributed computing tasks, including video editing and large-scale software testing. <br/>
<br/>
Companies like AWS has offered similar services in recent years, but MacWeb's integration of Apple's latest Mac hardware positions it at the forefront of the market, <a href="https://www.macstadium.com/bare-metal-mac">along with MacStadium</a>. MacWeb has retained its M2-based offerings for developers with less demanding performance requirements. <div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-mini/">Mac mini</a></div><div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m4/">M4</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m4-mac-mini/">M4 Mac mini</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Mac_Mini">Mac Mini (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/mac-mini.146">Mac mini</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/11/cloud-m4-mac-mini-models-now-available/">Cloud-Based M4 and M4 Pro Mac Mini Models Now Available</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/cloud-based-m4-and-m4-pro-mac-mini-models-now-available.2445105/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple Intelligence servers are currently powered <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/06/apple-building-m2-ultra-and-m4-servers/">by the M2 Ultra chip</a>, and they are expected to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/06/apple-intelligence-servers-with-m4-chips-report/">start using M4 series chips</a> next year. In an eventual move away from Mac chips for server use, <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/apple-is-working-on-ai-chip-with-broadcom"><em>The Information</em> today reported</a> that Apple is developing a new server chip that will offer even faster performance for AI features.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/Apple-Intelligence-iPhone-16.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="898" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-964551" /><br/>
The report said the new chip contains "many duplicates" of Apple's Neural Engine, so it sounds like it will offer turbocharged performance for AI processing.<br/>
<br/>
At least a trio of companies are believed to be involved with the chip. Apple is said to be handling the overall design of the chip, while Broadcom is said to be providing some networking technology for it. TSMC is expected to begin mass production of the chip in 2026, using its third-generation 3nm process, known as N3P. That is the same process expected to be used <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/18/a19-and-a19-pro-n3p-rumor/">for the A19 chips in the iPhone 17 models next year</a>.<br/>
<br/>
The chip will likely power some Apple Intelligence features that rely on server-based generation, such as Image Playground, according to the report:<blockquote>Apple will likely use the new AI chip it is developing for inference, where the chip processes new data—such as a user describing a possible image—and applies them to the models to generate an output, like producing the image itself.</blockquote>More on Broadcom's involvement, from the report:<blockquote>Like Google, Apple is relying on Broadcom for technology to network or link the chips together so they can work in unison to compute data more quickly. That technology has been one of the key drivers of AI development, making it possible to compute the massive amounts of data required to train and run LLMs. Networking technology is one of Broadcom's key strengths.</blockquote>The <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/apple-is-working-on-ai-chip-with-broadcom">paywalled report</a> offers many more details about the chip.<br/>
<br/>
Apple has announced that <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/11/ios-18-2-lanching-today/">iOS 18.2, iPadOS 18.2, and macOS Sequoia 15.2 will be released today</a> with additional Apple Intelligence features, including Genmoji, Image Playground, Image Wand, and ChatGPT integration for Siri. There is also a new Visual Intelligence feature on all iPhone 16 models that allows you to quickly identify things in the real world using the Camera Control button on those devices. As part of Apple Intelligence, Siri will gain features like on-screen awareness and deeper per-app controls, likely starting with iOS 18.4. And with iOS 19.4 in 2026, Siri is expected to become more conversational like ChatGPT.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/">Apple Intelligence</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/theinformation-com/">The Information</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/11/apple-intelligence-servers-new-chip-report/">Apple Intelligence Servers Expected to Get All-New, Turbocharged Chip</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-intelligence-servers-expected-to-get-all-new-turbocharged-chip.2445103/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

<br/>

Beats today is expanding its case lineup with two additional colors, Sunrise Pink and Twilight Blue, with the new cases including the iconic Beats logo in the center of the rear rather than the &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; alignment guides seen on the original versions.<br/>
<br/>
The cases are made of a polycarbonate back with flexible sidewalls for shock absorption, and they feature a glossy scratch-resistant exterior coating and a soft microfiber interior. Camera Control support is enabled via a sapphire crystal button coupled to a conductive layer to transmit finger movements to the button on the phone.<br/>
<br/>
The two new colors of cases are available for all four models in the &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; lineup, and are priced at &#36;49. They're available <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MDTK4LL/A/beats-iphone-16-pro-case-with-magsafe-special-edition-twilight-blue">through Apple's online store</a> starting today, and will be at <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-store/">Apple Store</a> retail locations starting tomorrow.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/11/beats-iphone-16-cases-pink-blue/">Beats Launches iPhone 16 Cases in New Sunrise Pink and Twilight Blue Colors</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/beats-launches-iphone-16-cases-in-new-sunrise-pink-and-twilight-blue-colors.2445101/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today is releasing iOS 18.2, which introduces a major change to the Mail app with its new Categories feature. Categories automatically sorts your emails into four distinct sections: Primary, Transactions, Updates, and Promotions. However, while this organizational system aims to help manage email overload, not everyone is going to prefer the new layout.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/ios-18-mail-app.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-957054" /><br/>
Mail Categories attempts to intelligently organize your incoming emails into different sections. Important emails are shown in a "Primary" category, with orders, newsletters, social notifications, and deals organized into three other sections.<br/>
<br/>
The "Transactions" section includes receipts, orders, and deliveries, and aims to make it easy to find orders that you've placed and shipping information for those orders. Meanwhile, the "Updates" section includes newsletters, alerts for things like doctor's appointments and correspondence, and other subscription emails. Lastly, Apple's "Promotions" category includes special offers and deal emails.<br/>
<br/>
Note that even if an email would normally fall into Transactions, Updates, or Promotions, it will also appear in your Primary inbox if it contains time-critical information. On devices that support Apple Intelligence, the system goes a step further by highlighting priority emails that require action or have deadlines.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Mail Categories: Why You Might Want to Revert</h2><br/>
The new Categories view, while helpful for some, might not suit your email management style for several reasons:<br/>
<ul><br/>
  <li>You prefer seeing all emails in chronological order.</li><br/>
  <li>Some messages may be incorrectly categorized.</li><br/>
  <li>You have your own organization system.</li><br/>
  <li>You find the extra sections distracting.</li><br/>
  <li>You want faster access to all emails without switching between categories.</li><br/>
</ul>You can swipe left across the categories to switch to an All Mail view, but what if you want to remove the categories completely?<br/>
<h2>iOS 18.2: How to Return to List View in Apple Mail</h2><br/>
Categories is the default view after updating to the new software. Fortunately, Apple makes it simple to switch back to the traditional list view. Here's how it's done:<br/>
<ol><br/>
  <li>Open the Mail app on your iPhone or iPad.</li><br/>
  <li>Tap the <strong>More</strong> button (three dots) in the upper right corner of your inbox.</li><br/>
  <li>Select <strong>List View</strong> from the pop-up menu.</li><br/>
</ol><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/10/remove-apple-mail-categories.jpg" alt="mail" width="4170" height="2760" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-981534" /><br/>
<br/>
Once you switch to List View, your inbox will return to showing all emails in chronological order, just as it did before iOS 18.2. The change takes effect immediately. While categorization is not perfect, it's likely something that Apple will improve over time. You can always switch back to Categories view using the same menu if you want to try it again later. <br/>
<br/>
Note: If you're using an iPhone that supports Apple Intelligence, you'll see an additional option in the More menu for priority messages. This option won't appear on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/does-my-iphone-support-apple-intelligence/">devices without Apple Intelligence support</a>. The More menu also has an "About Categories" section where you can see how your messages have been categorized over the course of the last week, but there is no option to tell the Mail app if you believe an email has been put into the wrong category.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/">Apple Intelligence</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/ios-disable-apple-mail-categories/">How to Turn Off Mail Categories in iOS 18.2</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/how-to-turn-off-mail-categories-in-ios-18-2.2445097/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Amazon this week has brought back a low price for the Apple Pencil Pro, available for <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0D3J71RM7%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"><strong>&#36;99.00</strong></a>, down from &#36;129.00. Alongside this deal, we're tracking a collection of Apple accessory discounts, including great deals on the Magic Keyboard and MagSafe Charger.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/10/accessories-prime-day.jpeg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-969108" /><em><small>Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with some of these vendors. When you click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment, which helps us keep the site running.</small></em><br/>
<br/>
<h2>Apple Pencil Pro</h2><br/>
Deals on the Apple Pencil Pro have been very rare throughout the past few weeks, and they never last long. So, although this isn't an all-time low price, it's still a great deal and potentially your last chance to get the accessory at a discount before Christmas.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Update:</strong> As expected, the Apple Pencil Pro deal has quickly expired, but the other deals below remain available.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0D3J71RM7%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"target="_blank"><div class="fancybutton"><div class="fancybadge">&#36;30 OFF</div>Apple Pencil Pro for &#36;99.00</div></a></div><br/>
<h2>AirTag</h2><br/>
Amazon is also discounting Apple's AirTag 4-Pack to <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0D54JZTHY%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"><strong>&#36;72.99</strong></a> this week, down from &#36;99.00. This is just about &#36;3 higher when compared to the all-time low price and it's still a great deal on the accessory, with guaranteed Christmas delivery.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0D54JZTHY%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"target="_blank"><div class="fancybutton"><div class="fancybadge">&#36;26 OFF</div>AirTag 4-Pack for &#36;72.99</div></a></div><br/>
<h2>iPad Pro Magic Keyboard</h2><br/>
Moving to the new 2024 Magic Keyboard, you can get the 11-inch model in Black for <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0D3J65R9N%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"><strong>&#36;249.99</strong></a>, down from &#36;299.00. This is an all-time low price on the accessory and it can still be delivered in time for Christmas on Amazon.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0D3J65R9N%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"target="_blank"><div class="fancybutton"><div class="fancybadge">&#36;49 OFF</div>11-inch M4 iPad Pro Magic Keyboard for &#36;249.99</div></a></div><br/>
<h2>MagSafe Charger</h2><br/>
Amazon introduced a few deals on Apple's new lineup of MagSafe Chargers this week. You can get the 1-meter model for <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0DGJ4QQ5W%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"><strong>&#36;29.99</strong></a> and 2-meter model for <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0DGHHJXTC%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"><strong>&#36;34.99</strong></a>, both representing solid second-best prices on the accessory.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0DGJ4QQ5W%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"target="_blank"><div class="fancybutton"><div class="fancybadge">&#36;9 OFF</div>1-meter MagSafe Charger for &#36;29.99</div></a></div><br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0DGHHJXTC%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"target="_blank"><div class="fancybutton"><div class="fancybadge">&#36;14 OFF</div>2-meter MagSafe Charger for &#36;34.99</div></a></div><br/>
<br/>
The new MagSafe Chargers provide overall faster charging speeds with compatible iPhone models. When paired with a 30W power adapter, iPhone 16 models can charge at up to 25W wirelessly over MagSafe, which is 10W faster than a regular non-MagSafe Qi2 wireless charger.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[In iOS 18.2, which Apple is releasing today, Apple's new Genmoji feature lets you create personalized emoji that aim to perfectly match what you want to express, going far beyond the limitations of standard Unicode emoji. Want an emoji of a break-dancing astronaut or a dog playing bagpipes? With Genmoji, you can make it happen.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/11/Genmoji-Feature-1.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-975005" /><br/>
Unlike standard emoji that are fixed Unicode characters, Genmoji are dynamically generated using on-device AI. They work seamlessly in text, appearing as inline emoji characters in supported apps like Messages and Notes. You can even create Genmoji based on people in your Photos app, making them more personal and expressive.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Requirements and Availability</h2><br/>
Genmoji is available in the iOS 18.2 update, which Apple is releasing on December 11, 2024. The feature also requires Apple Intelligence, which is limited to iPhone 15 Pro/Pro Max and iPhone 16 series models. Apple Intelligence does not currently work in the EU.<br/>
<br/>
Even with a compatible device in a supported region, you'll need to join a waitlist for Apple Intelligence features like image creation (Settings ➝ Apple Intelligence & Siri). Apple will notify you when access is granted. Note that Apple Intelligence is only available when your iPhone and Siri are set to the same language. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/10/iOS-18-Genmoji-WWDC.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-973017" /><br/>
Apple Intelligence is available in English (US) in most regions around the world, while iOS 18.2 adds Apple Intelligence support for English (Australia), English (Canada), English (Ireland), English (New Zealand), English (South Africa) and English (UK). <br/>
<br/>
<h2>Compatibility</h2><br/>
While Genmoji work best between iOS 18.2 devices, they're also viewable on devices running iOS/iPadOS 18.1 and later, as well as Macs running macOS Sequoia 15.1 and later.<br/>
<br/>
On older Apple devices or Android phones, Genmoji appear as regular images rather than inline emoji characters. Third-party apps need to specifically add Genmoji support to enable creation and proper display of these custom emoji.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Creating Custom Emoji in Messages</h2><br/>
<ol><br/>
  <li>In Messages, start a conversation or choose an existing one.</li><br/>
  <li>Tap the emoji symbol in the bottom-left corner of the keyboard.</li><br/>
  <li>In the emoji search field, describe your desired emoji (alternatively, tap the colored smiling emoji at the far right, then enter your description).</li><br/>
  <li>Tap <strong>Create New Emoji</strong>.<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/11/create-genmoji-ios.jpg" alt="messages" width="4377" height="2796" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-977428" /><br/>
  <li>On the New Genmoji screen, wait a moment for the amorphous blob to transform into your new emoji.</li><br/>
  <li>When the navigational symbols appear below the emoji, swipe left to preview alternative versions of your creation.</li><br/>
  <li>Tap the ellipsis button to add a caption to your emoji or save it as a sticker. You can also provide feedback to Apple using the thumbs up/down buttons.</li><br/>
  <li>Tap <strong>Add</strong> when you're happy with your selection, then tap the blue arrow button to send your new Genmoji.<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/11/create-genmoji-ios-1.jpg" alt="messages" width="4377" height="2796" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-977430" /><br/>
</ol>With Genmoji, emoji finally become as limitless as your imagination. Having said that, Apple does maintain content restrictions similar to Image Playground to keep things appropriate. Regardless, once you start creating custom emoji, you might find standard emoji feeling a bit limited in comparison.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/">Apple Intelligence</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/genmoji/">Genmoji</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/create-custom-emoji-messages-genmoji/">iOS 18.2: Create Custom Emoji in Messages With Genmoji</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-18-2-create-custom-emoji-in-messages-with-genmoji.2445092/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[TP-Link has launched a new Smart In-Wall Outlet under its <a href="https://www.tapo.com/us/">Tapo</a> brand, bundling Matter support and a feature that lets users monitor the energy usage of connected devices.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/12/tapo-smart-wifi-outlet-matter.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-981490" /><br/>
The Tapo P210M includes overcharge protection, meaning when connected devices are fully charged, the outlet switches off. The 15A/1800W outlet also features Power Protection, which automatically turns off devices when the power exceeds a user-specified threshold.<br/>
<br/>
The aforementioned energy monitoring is accessed via the Tapo app, providing tracking of the outlet's energy use through stats and charts. Users can save money on their bills by scheduling devices to turn off during periods of inactivity. Note that this dual-socket model also has manual on/off buttons for each outlet.<br/>
<br/>
The all-important Matter support over Wi-Fi eliminates the need for an additional hub, but a controller is necessary. In Apple Home terms, that equates to an Apple TV 4K (2021 and 2022 models), HomePod (both generations), or HomePod mini.<br/>
<br/>
The <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FTapo-P210M-Compatible-Monitoring-SmartThings%2Fdp%2FB0DLLQR3K7%2F">Tapo Smart Wi-Fi Outlet</a> retails at &#36;30, but it is currently listed as on sale at <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FTapo-P210M-Compatible-Monitoring-SmartThings%2Fdp%2FB0DLLQR3K7%2F">Amazon.com</a>, with a 33% discount bringing the price below &#36;20. <br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Microsoft has <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/microsoftteamsblog/introducing-external-camera-support-for-ipads-in-microsoft-teams/4355767">announced</a> that Teams for iPad now supports external cameras, allowing users with older devices to hook up better-quality webcams during Teams calls.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/12/teams-ipad-external-camera-support.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-981486" /><br/>
With iPadOS 17, Apple added support for connecting external cameras to iPads with a USB-C port, and Microsoft has just got around to leveraging the feature for users who want to benefit from higher resolution, better dynamic range, and the ability to adjust angles when videoconferencing. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks to Microsoft's implementation, connecting a camera for use in Teams couldn't be simpler. Plug your external camera into your iPad's USB-C port either before or during your Teams meeting, and the app will automatically select it for use on the call. To switch back to your iPad's built-in camera, simply disconnect the external one.<br/>
<br/>
The plug and play simplicity of the support does mean that there are currently no native or Teams controls to manually switch between your iPad's internal camera and an external one. For now at least, Teams will default to the connected external camera whenever one is plugged in.<br/>
<br/>
Microsoft says most webcams that work over a USB-C connection are supported, so finding a compatible model shouldn't be an issue.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/microsoft-teams/">Microsoft Teams</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/11/microsoft-teams-ipad-external-camera-support/">Microsoft Teams for iPad Now Includes External Camera Support</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/microsoft-teams-for-ipad-now-includes-external-camera-support.2445086/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Spotify today shut down all Car Thing accessories, several months after announcing plans to discontinue the product. As of this week, Car Thing is no longer functional and will not work with the Spotify streaming service.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/04/spotify-car-thing-1.jpg" alt="" width="3840" height="1879" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-793755" /><br/>
Car Thing owners who power on the device now only see the following message:<blockquote>Car Thing is discontinued and no longer operational.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for being on this journey with us, safe travels. For more information, visit carthing.com Contact customer service by no later than January 14, 2025 to discuss your refund options.</blockquote>Spotify's Car Thing was <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/13/spotify-announces-the-car-thing-hardware-device/">first introduced</a> in April 2021, and it was Spotify's first hardware product. The accessory was designed to provide simple access to Spotify music while in a vehicle, and it was especially useful in vehicles without modern infotainment systems.<br/>
<br/>
Spotify <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/07/29/spotify-stops-making-dash-mounted-car-thing/">stopped making Car Thing</a> just five months after it launched due to low product demand and supply chain issues. Existing Car Thing accessories continued to function as expected, until this week.<br/>
<br/>
Back in May, Spotify announced that it was discontinuing Car Thing, and earlier this month, it told customers that the device would stop working at some point in December. Spotify says that Car Thing was discontinued in an effort to streamline product offerings.<br/>
<br/>
Car Thing cost &#36;90 when it launched, and existing units are entirely non-operational now that Spotify has decided to brick them. Spotify has directed customers to recycle their Car Things.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/spotify/">Spotify</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/10/spotify-car-thing-officially-dead/">Spotify&#039;s Car Thing Accessory is Officially Dead</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/spotifys-car-thing-accessory-is-officially-dead.2445072/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Satechi recently came out with <a href="https://satechi.net/products/vegan-leather-passport-cover-with-find-my">a Find My wallet</a> that's designed to work with a passport, allowing you to keep tabs on your most important documents when you're traveling.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/12/satechi-wallet-1.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-981478" /><br/>
Priced at &#36;60, the Passport Cover with <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/find-my/">Find My</a> is made from a simple but attractive black vegan leather material. It has a book-like shape and it is sized to hold a passport on one side, with four card slots for IDs and credit cards on the other side. There's also a pocket that can be used for holding money or an airline ticket.<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately, there is no strap, zipper, or other closure method included, so if you have it stuffed with several things, there is a possibility that something could come out. Cards slot into the holders and there's also a holder for the passport, but it would be nice to have an extra layer of security keeping everything closed.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/12/satechi-wallet-2.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-981479" /><br/>
Satechi's Passport Cover can be added to the &zwnj;Find My&zwnj; app alongside AirTags and other Find My-equipped devices. It is able to be tracked through the "Items" tab in the &zwnj;Find My&zwnj; app, and setup is as simple as pushing a button and holding it near the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>.<br/>
<br/>
All of the &zwnj;Find My&zwnj; features are included, so the Passport Cover can be tracked on a map with directions to it, it can play a sound out loud, and you can get alerts when it is left behind and separated from your &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;. &zwnj;Find My&zwnj; devices use the &zwnj;Find My&zwnj; network when you're out of range, so if someone's &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; is near the Passport Cover, you'll be updated with its location.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/12/satechi-wallet-3.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-981480" /><br/>
There is a built-in battery that Satechi says lasts for up to five months. It can be recharged using Qi, Qi2, or <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe/">MagSafe</a>, so while there is no cable to hassle with, you do need to have a wireless charger available. I much prefer the Qi-based charging to charging with a cable, and there is a ring on the front that lets you know where to charge.<br/>
<br/>
The four card slots inside the Passport Cover have RFID protection to prevent card skimming from contactless credit cards for peace of mind.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/12/satechi-wallet-4.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-981481" /><br/>
I haven't had the Passport Cover on hand long enough to test its longevity, but the material is soft to the touch, pleasant to hold, and it feels durable. It is worth noting that while Satechi calls this a vegan leather, the texture does not resemble leather and it will not develop the same patina over time.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Bottom Line</h2><br/>
There are passport holders that have built-in slots for AirTags, but Satechi's Passport Cover is sleeker and more convenient with built-in wireless charging. There are also several other &zwnj;Find My&zwnj; passport holders on the market, but many of them are more expensive. Some are cheaper, but for something as important as a passport, it's a good idea to go with a recognized brand.<br/>
<br/>
If you're someone who travels often or if you have a big trip coming up where you want to make sure you can keep an eye on your passport, Satechi's Passport Cover is worth considering.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>How to Buy</h2><br/>
Satechi's Passport Cover with &zwnj;Find My&zwnj; can be <a href="https://satechi.net/products/vegan-leather-passport-cover-with-find-my">purchased from the Satechi website</a> or <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FSatechi-Passport-Wireless-Charging-protection%2Fdp%2FB0DC1PLG2L">from Amazon</a> for &#36;59.99.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Yelp <a href="https://blog.yelp.com/news/end-of-year-product-release-2024/">today announced</a> several new features powered by artificial intelligence, including a new integration with <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-maps/">Apple Maps</a> that's available to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> users and an option for summarizing review content.<br/>
<br/>

Review Insights uses large language models to surface reviews and information tailored to details that you are looking for when searching for a restaurant or other location to visit. Review Insights can discern reviewer sentiment about food quality, service, ambiance, wait time, and drinks. The LLM behind the feature can understand context in a review to provide relevant information even if a a key word you're looking for isn't in a review.<br/>
<br/>
Yelp says that Review Insights are aggregated as sentiment scores that range from 1 to 100 and are positive, neutral, or critical. Tapping into the score provides the review related to a specific topic of interest. Review insights are available for restaurant, food, and nightlife businesses on iOS devices.<br/>
<br/>
The Yelp homepage is gaining more personalized content and trending searches to make it easier to find new places to visit, and the company is testing AI videos that use real photos, videos, and information from Yelp to create videos about local restaurants. Unfortunately, the homepage is gaining autoplay user videos that unmute and expand to full screen<br/>
<br/>
Business pages will now show information on a location's tipping policies and payment policies, and Yelp Assistant allows for quote requests using texts and calls after a project is submitted.<br/>
<br/>
In &zwnj;Apple Maps&zwnj;, there's a new integration for connecting directly to pros and requesting a quote via Yelp. &zwnj;Apple Maps&zwnj; has a "Quote" button on businesses pages that links to the Request a Quote flow in the Yelp app or the Yelp mobile web experience.<br/>
<br/>

With Tap to Pay on &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;, an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; is able to accept payment using <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-pay/">Apple Pay</a>, contactless credit and debit cards, and other digital wallets using NFC technology. Transactions are encrypted and Apple does not have information about what is purchased or the person that made the purchase.<br/>
<br/>
On the customer end, using Tap to Pay on &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; works like any standard &zwnj;Apple Pay&zwnj; transaction. Sellers open up an app on an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; XS or later, register a sale, and present an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; to the buyer, who can then use a contactless payment method to complete the transaction.<br/>
<br/>
In Chile, SumUp is supporting the Tap to Pay on &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; feature for merchants. SumUp is known for its iPhone-connected card reader, and the Tap to Pay feature uses the same infrastructure, but without the need for additional hardware.<br/>
<br/>
Tap to Pay on &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; launched in February 2022 in the United States, and since then, Apple has been working to expand it to additional countries. The feature is available in Australia, Austria, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Czech Republic, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Japan, New Zealand, Netherlands, Romania, Sweden, Taiwan, Ukraine, United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom, and the United States.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/chile/">Chile</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tap-to-pay-on-iphone/">Tap to Pay on iPhone</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/10/tap-to-pay-on-iphone-chile/">Tap to Pay on iPhone Launches in Chile</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/tap-to-pay-on-iphone-launches-in-chile.2445067/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Instagram today gained a <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2024/12/trial-reels-try-content-non-followers-first-see-what-perfoms-best/">new trial reels feature</a>, which is designed to allow content creators to try out new formants and content to see what performs best. Trial reels are shared with people who do not follow a creator, giving insights into what performs well so it can then be shared with followers.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/03/Instagram-Feature-1.jpg" alt="" width="2250" height="1266" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-786417" /><br/>
Trial Reels let creators experiment with new ideas and post frequency without worrying about losing followers or creating content that followers don't want to see. Instagram says that the feature will "help take the guesswork out of how your content will perform."<br/>
<br/>
Content that is performing well in a trial reel can be shared with followers with a tap, or it can be set to be shared with followers automatically if it's performed well after the trial period.<br/>
<br/>
Sharing a trial reel can be done by creating a reel and then tapping on the "Trial" toggle when uploading it. Trial reels are not shown to people on the creator's main grid or the Reels tab unless they are lated shared with all users.<br/>
<br/>
The trial period lasts for 24 hours, and then Instagram provides key engagement metrics like views, likes, comments, and shares so creators can see how the content is performing.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/instagram/">Instagram</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/10/instagram-trial-reels/">Instagram Lets Creators Test Content With Trial Reels Feature</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/instagram-lets-creators-test-content-with-trial-reels-feature.2445063/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple <a href="https://www.apple.com/uk/newsroom/2024/12/apple-expands-uk-investment-and-doubles-local-engineering-teams/">today announced</a> that it has invested more than £18 billion in the United Kingdom over the last five years, plus it has doubled the number of engineering teams in the country.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/12/apple-store-uk.jpg" alt="" width="1960" height="1400" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-981463" /><br/>
Apple says that it supports 550,000 jobs in the UK through direct employment, its product supply chain, and the iOS app economy. Apple's UK engineering teams work on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/">Apple Intelligence</a>, Private Cloud Compute, and silicon engineering.<blockquote>"We've been serving customers in the U.K. for more than 40 years, and we're proud of our deep connection with communities across this country," said Tim Cook, Apple's CEO. "We're thrilled to be growing our Apple teams here, and to keep supporting the extraordinary innovators, creators, and entrepreneurs who are pushing the boundaries of technology in so many ways."</blockquote>Apple has also added jobs in the country through expanded <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a>+ production, which has tripled in the past two years. &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj;+ adds jobs for cast and crew in the UK, but also hundreds of suppliers across business sectors like construction, manufacturing, and hospitality.<br/>
<br/>
Since the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a> launched in 2008, Apple says that UK developers have earned £9 billion from selling digital goods and services.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple is ramping up work on a blood pressure monitoring feature for the Apple Watch and it could be ready as soon as 2025, reports <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-12-10/apple-plans-apple-watch-ultra-3-next-year-with-satellite-texting-and-5g"><em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman</a>. Blood pressure monitoring is a health addition that Apple has been working on for the last several years, and based on rumors, Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/17/apple-watch-2024-health-features/">wanted to debut it in 2024</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/Apple-Watch-Series-10-lineup-240909-feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-964982" /><br/>
The feature would not provide exact systolic and diastolic blood pressure measurements, instead tracking whether a user's blood pressure is trending upwards and sending an alert if hypertension is detected. After receiving an alert, the Apple Watch user could provide the information to a medical professional for additional testing.<br/>
<br/>
Hypertension is known as a silent killer because it can go undetected and undiagnosed, leading to heart damage and death. High blood pressure often has few symptoms until it is notably advanced, and early detection via the Apple Watch has the potential to save lives. The Apple Watch already has the ability to detect atrial fibrillation or an irregular heart beat, plus it can be used to take one-lead ECG readings. There is also a blood oxygen monitoring feature, but it is disabled in current models in the United States due to patent issues. <br/>
<br/>
According to Gurman, Apple is aiming to introduce the feature in the Apple Watch Ultra 3, and it would also presumably be included in the standard Apple Watch coming in 2025 as well. It is not yet entirely clear if Apple will be able to launch the feature in 2025, given that it was previously delayed. In 2022, Apple was reportedly dealing with accuracy issues during testing, but those problems may have been solved.<br/>
<br/>
Apple is also continuing to work on noninvasive blood glucose monitoring, but that feature is not yet ready to launch.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch/">Apple Watch 10</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch-ultra/">Apple Watch Ultra 2</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch">Apple Watch (Buy Now)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch_Ultra">Apple Watch Ultra (Neutral)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-watch.172">Apple Watch</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/10/apple-watch-blood-pressure-monitoring-2025/">Apple Watch Could Get Blood Pressure Monitoring in 2025</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-watch-could-get-blood-pressure-monitoring-in-2025.2445058/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>
