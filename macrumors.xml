		<description><![CDATA[Apple may be proceeding with plans to release a new Mac model this month, according to potentially related information obtained by <em>MacRumors</em>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/Apple-Logo-Spotlight.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-912758" /><br/>
Details pertaining to imminent changes to Mac trade-ins provided to <em>MacRumors</em> by a verified source suggest that Apple will likely begin accepting new models for trade-in this month. Similar changes in June coincided with WWDC, when Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/06/05/apple-trade-ins-mac-studio-m2-macboook-air/">began accepting</a> trade-ins of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-studio/">Mac Studio</a>, 13-inch <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m2/">M2</a> <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/">MacBook Air</a>, and 13-inch &zwnj;M2&zwnj; MacBook Pro for credit towards new Apple product purchases. Apple simultaneously launched the 15-inch &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj;, second-generation &zwnj;Mac Studio&zwnj;, and Apple silicon <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-pro/">Mac Pro</a>. As such, it seems plausible that a similar, albeit smaller, expansion of the Macs Apple accepts for trade-in this month may correlate with the launch of at least one new machine around mid-October.<br/>
<br/>
In July, <em>Bloomberg</em>'s <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a> said October of this year could see the announcement of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/07/17/apple-m3-macs-october-event/">first Macs with the M3 chip</a>. He said that the 13-inch &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj;, 13-inch MacBook Pro, and 24-inch <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/">iMac</a> are all candidates for potential release this month.<br/>
<br/>
The as-yet-unannounced M3 chip is widely expected to be fabricated with TSMC's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/3nm/">3nm</a> process for performance and power efficiency improvements compared to the current 5nm-based &zwnj;M2&zwnj; chip, which debuted in June 2022. It will also likely feature an all new GPU with hardware ray-tracing, first introduced on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a>'s A17 Pro chip last month.<br/>
<br/>
In September, Apple analyst <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/">Ming-Chi Kuo</a> said that it seemed Apple will <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/08/kuo-first-m3-macbooks-unlikely-2023/">not launch new MacBook models</a> with M3 series chips before the end of this year. This may mean that the most likely Mac to be announced is a refreshed 24-inch &zwnj;iMac&zwnj; with the M3 chip. The current model featuring the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m1/">M1</a> chip has now been on sale for over two and a half years.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/03/trade-in-changes-may-indicate-new-mac-this-month/">Mac Trade-In Changes May Indicate New Model to Launch This Month</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/mac-trade-in-changes-may-indicate-new-model-to-launch-this-month.2406100/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today started selling refurbished second-generation HomePod models <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/FQJ73LL/A/Refurbished-HomePod-2nd-Gen-Midnight">in the U.S.</a> for the first time since the speaker was released in January. The refurbished models are priced at &#36;249, down from &#36;299 for a brand new model.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/01/HomePod-2-Midnight-Closeup-Feature-Blue-Orange.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-881768" /><br/>
Apple began selling refurbished HomePods <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/02/apple-refurbished-homepod-2-select-countries/">in the U.K., Australia, Japan, and many other countries</a> last week. Availability has yet to begin in Canada.<br/>
<br/>
Apple says its refurbished HomePods undergo full functionality testing, and they are inspected, cleaned, and repackaged in a plain white box with the power cord and documentation. The refurbished HomePods are covered by Apple's limited one-year warranty policy, and they are eligible for extended AppleCare+ coverage.<br/>
<br/>
The second-generation HomePod has a similar design as the original HomePod that was discontinued in 2021, but with a larger backlit touch surface, two fewer tweeters, two fewer microphones, an indoor temperature and humidity sensor, and a few other changes.

		<title>MicroLED Apple Watch Still on Track for Late 2025 Launch</title>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/microled-apple-watch/">microLED Apple Watch</a> is on track to launch in late 2025, according to Jeff Pu, a tech analyst at Hong Kong investment firm Haitong International Securities.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/09/apple-watch-ultra-1-1.jpg" alt="" width="3840" height="2160" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-866346" /><br/>
In a note to investors seen by <em>MacRumors</em>, Pu said that the first Apple Watch with a microLED display will launch in late 2025. The advanced display technology offers improved brightness, color reproduction, and viewing angles, making images look more like they are "painted" atop the glass.<br/>
<br/>
Yesterday, a Weibo leaker reported that the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/02/next-major-apple-watch-upgrade-to-be-microled/">next worthwhile upgrade</a> for the Apple Watch Ultra users will be Apple's custom microLED display technology. Apple's plan to bring a microLED display to the Apple Watch Ultra is very widely corroborated, starting with a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/01/10/microled-apple-watch-2025/">report</a> from display analyst Ross Young in January.<br/>
<br/>
After initially placing the device's launch in 2024, Young moved his forecast to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/27/apple-watch-ultra-second-half-2025/">second-half of 2025</a>. <em>Bloomberg</em>, on the other hand, reported a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/01/10/apple-custom-displays-microled-apple-watch/">2024 time frame</a> earlier this year. TrendForce <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/07/04/apple-watch-ultra-microled-delayed-early-2026/">claims</a> that Apple's first microLED display will launch on a new Apple Watch Ultra model in 2026, due to supply chain adjustments. With Young and Pu, as well as leaks on Weibo, now pointing to a launch in 2025, the &zwnj;microLED Apple Watch&zwnj; Ultra may launch sooner than previously expected.<br/>
<br/>
The microLED display is expected to be 2.12-inches in size, a 10% increase over the display of the current Apple Watch Ultra. <em>Bloomberg</em>'s <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a> <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/01/15/apple-custom-displays-heading-to-iphone-ipad-and-mac-after-apple-watch/">reported</a> Apple is likely planning to bring custom microLED displays to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>, and Mac after the technology debuts in a new version of the Apple Watch Ultra. He believes Apple's long-term plan is to bring microLED displays to all of its key products. Other reports from <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/10/microled-iphone-report/"><em>DigiTimes</em></a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/18/apple-mass-produce-microled-iphone/"><em>Nikkei Asia</em></a>, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/06/apple-microled-struggle-led-to-reliance-on-samsung/"><em>The Information</em></a> have indicated similar plans for Apple to transition to custom microLED displays across multiple product lines in an effort to become less <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/06/apple-microled-struggle-led-to-reliance-on-samsung/">reliant on Samsung</a>.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch-ultra/">Apple Watch Ultra 2</a></div><div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/micro-led/">Micro-LED</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/jeff-pu/">Jeff Pu</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/microled-apple-watch/">microLED Apple Watch</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch_Ultra">Apple Watch Ultra (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-watch.172">Apple Watch</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/03/microled-apple-watch-still-on-track-for-2025/">MicroLED Apple Watch Still on Track for Late 2025 Launch</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/microled-apple-watch-still-on-track-for-late-2025-launch.2406087/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple has started requiring new apps to show proof of a Chinese government license in order to be listed on the China App Store, as the company joins rival app stores that adopted the policy years earlier to meet tightening state regulations (via <em><a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/apple-enforces-new-check-apps-china-beijing-tightens-oversight-2023-10-03/">Reuters</a></em>). <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/01/iOS-App-Store-General-Feature-Dock.jpg" alt="" width="2250" height="1266" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-833992" /><br/>
Apple last Friday began requiring an "internet content provider (ICP) filing" from developers when they submit new apps to be published on the local App Store. An ICP filing is the state registration system required for websites to operate legally in China. <br/>
<br/>
To get the license, developers must have a company in China or work with a local publisher, a requirement that has stymied take-up by a large number of foreign apps. <br/>
<br/>
Most local app stores including those operated by Tencent and Huawei have adopted the filing since at least 2017, so Apple is simply falling in line with a recently updated policy that is already established in China's software publishing industry.<br/>
<br/>
China already blocks the websites of many popular western social media apps like Instagram, Facebook, and YouTube, but iPhone users in China have been able to download their apps from Apple's ‌App Store‌ by using unauthorized VPN services that connect them to an internet server outside the country. <br/>
<br/>
Under new rules issued in July by China's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, Apple will no longer be able to offer such apps in its China ‌App Store‌ from next July unless the app operators are registered with the government.<br/>
<br/>
Chinese officials last week reportedly <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/29/apple-china-discuss-rules-banning-western-apps/">told</a> Apple staff that the company must strictly implement the rules banning unregistered foreign apps, thereby closing the loophole allowing Chinese ‌iPhone‌ users to download them. Apple was said to have been told that the new rules are needed to crack down on online scams, pornography, and the circulation of information that violates China's censorship rules.<br/>

Most foreign app operators are unlikely to register with the Chinese government, because doing so would force them to comply with data transfer and censorship requirements.

		<description><![CDATA[The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a> brings over 50 new features and improvements to Apple's high-end smartphones compared to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> 12 Pro, which was released three years prior. This buyer's guide breaks down every major difference you should be aware of between the two generations and helps you to decide whether it's worth upgrading.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/iPhone-12-Pro-vs-15-Pro-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-915097" /><br/>
The &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 12 Pro debuted in 2020, introducing the A14 Bionic chip, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe-battery-pack/">MagSafe</a>, improved water resistance, Ceramic Shield glass, 2GB more memory, a LiDAR scanner, Night mode portraits and Apple ProRAW images, HDR video recording with Dolby Vision, and a larger display on the smaller model. The &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 12 Pro was discontinued upon the announcement of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-13/">iPhone 13</a> Pro in 2021, but it is still possible to get hold of it at fairly low prices second-hand.<br/>
<br/>
Our guide helps to answer the question of how to decide which of these two &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; models is best for you by clearly showing all of the differences that the &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; brings to the table. This article focuses on the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 12 Pro and &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj;, but to understand the differences between the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-14/">iPhone 14</a> Pro and &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj;, see our other buyer's guide:<br/>

<br/>
Although the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 12 Pro and &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; share most of their basic features, the &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; offers a large number of notable upgrades, such as a titanium design, always-on Retina display with ProMotion, Action button, USB-C port, 48-megapixel main camera, A17 Pro chip, and longer battery life.<br/>

Overall, the &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; is a significant upgrade over the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 12 Pro, with significant changes in virtually every area of the device. The display's &zwnj;Dynamic Island&zwnj;, always-on functionality, ProMotion technology for refresh rates up to 120Hz, slimmer bezels, and considerably higher peak brightness make for significant changes on the front of the device, while the switch to a titanium chassis, USB-C port, and Action button are similarly noticeable elsewhere. The photography and videography capabilities of the devices radically differ, with over 20 of the differences between the smartphones relating to camera technologies. The &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj;'s more repairable design, 2GB of additional memory, and A17 Pro chip also ensure that it will be a more future-proof device.<br/>
<br/>
Due to the scale and breadth of these improvements, most &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 12 Pro users will be able to justify upgrading to the &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj;, especially if they value its more refined design, USB-C port, Action button, and camera improvements. It is only worth sticking with the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 12 Pro if you are holding off for an even more substantial upgrade with next year's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a> Pro, but many users will see a multitude of tangible benefits by upgrading now.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-15-Pro">iPhone 15 Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99">iPhone</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone-12-pro-vs-iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 12 Pro vs. iPhone 15 Pro Buyer&#039;s Guide: 50+ Differences Compared</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-12-pro-vs-iphone-15-pro-buyers-guide-50-differences-compared.2406083/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Spotify CEO Daniel Ek is urging lawmakers in the United Kingdom to adopt a bill that would regulate competition in digital markets, cutting down on the dominance of Apple, Google, and other large tech companies.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/06/Apple-vs-Spotify-feature2.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-801789" /><br/>
The <a href="https://bills.parliament.uk/bills/3453">Digital Markets, Competition, and Consumers Bill</a> (DMCC) that the UK is developing would allow competition authorities to impose conduct requirements on companies and "promote competition" when a company's policies are "having an adverse effect on competition." Ek has long advocated for legislation that hobbles Apple's ability to both offer a platform (iOS) and compete on that platform with apps like Spotify rival <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/">Apple Music</a>.<br/>
<br/>
In an interview with <em><a href="https://www.ft.com/content/f0138fee-5375-47b2-a717-a1eaf8038512">Financial Times</a></em>, Ek said that Apple and Google's control over how billions of consumers access the internet is "insane."<br/>
<br/>
"Not only are they dictating the rules, they also compete directly downstream with those providers," said Ek. Ek wants the UK bill to make sure that a company that's the referee in the digital market "can't also be the player." The DMCC needs to have "real teeth" he said, adding that the bill is for all developers. "More and more of these developers are now finding that Apple is a competitor," he said.<br/>
<br/>
If passed, the DMCC would give the UK's Competition and Markets Authority the power to impose multibillion-pound fines for large companies that breach the established rules. Tech companies would be required to provide more transparency about how their app stores work, with regulators able to open up specific markets like app stores or search engines.<br/>
<br/>
Spotify has been in a feud with Apple for years, with the dispute between the two companies most recently heating up in 2022 when Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/10/25/spotify-audio-book-app-update-rejected-apple/">rejected a Spotify app update</a> that added audiobook support. Spotify back in 2019 filed a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2019/03/13/spotify-files-complaint-vs-apple-in-europe/">regulatory complaint</a> in the European Union over Apple's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a> practices, which is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/02/28/apple-responds-to-eu-narrowing-antitrust-case/">still under investigation</a>, and the company has also backed the Open Markets Act in the United States, legislation that would require Apple to allow for sideloading and alternate app stores.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/spotify/">Spotify</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/02/spotify-apple-uk-legislation/">Spotify CEO on Apple and Google: &#039;If You Want to Be the Referee, You Can&#039;t Also Be the Player&#039;</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/spotify-ceo-on-apple-and-google-if-you-want-to-be-the-referee-you-cant-also-be-the-player.2406014/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<title>Apple Deal Responsible for Google&#039;s Dominance in Search, Says Microsoft CEO</title>

		<description><![CDATA[Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella today said that he believes the search engine deal between Apple and Google has made it impossible for other search engines like Bing to compete (via <em><a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/microsoft-ceo-testifies-about-limits-of-ai-at-google-antitrust-trial-32d032a9">The Wall Street Journal</a></em>). With Google as the default search engine on Safari on all Apple devices, people become accustomed to using it, Nadella explained in testimony he gave during the ongoing Google vs. U.S. Department of Justice antitrust trial.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/02/microsoft-bing-chatgpt.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-884498" /><br/>
"You get up in the morning, you brush your teeth, and you search on Google," said Nadella. "With that level of habit forming, the only way to change is by changing defaults." Nadella went on to say that Google is able to use its ~90 percent market share to improve search results, further reinforcing its monopoly. He said that it's "bogus" that there is choice in the search engine market.<br/>
<br/>
Microsoft has been attempting to chip market share away from Google by adding OpenAI's chatbot technology to Bing, but Nadella says it is unclear how much AI can reshape the existing market because Google's distribution advantage doesn't go away. "I worry a lot about that," he said. "Even in spite of my enthusiasm that there is a new angle with AI, this vicious cycle that I'm trapped in could become even more vicious because the defaults get reinforced."<br/>
<br/>
Last week, iTunes chief <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/eddy-cue/">Eddy Cue</a> <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/26/apple-on-why-google-is-default-on-iphone/">testified in the trial</a> and explained that Apple opts for Google as the default search engine on its devices because the company has "always thought it was the best." Google does pay Apple billions of dollars per year to remain the default search engine, though Cue claimed there is no valid alternative.<br/>
<br/>
Back in 2020, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/28/microsoft-bing-acquisition-talks/">Microsoft approached Apple</a> and offered up Bing as a potential acquisition target, but talks between Microsoft execs and &zwnj;Eddy Cue&zwnj; did not progress, both because of the money Apple gets from Google and concerns that Bing would not be able to compete with Google Search.<br/>
<br/>
Nadella is likely correct that it would be difficult at this point for any search engine to truly compete with Google, especially as long as Google remains the default search engine on Apple devices. The exception might be if Apple decides to develop its own search engine at some point.<br/>
<br/>
In <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2023-10-01/could-apple-replace-google-with-own-search-engine-it-s-possible-but-unlikely-ln7gywed">Sunday's edition of the Power On newsletter</a>, <em>Bloomberg</em>'s <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a> <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/12/19/apple-to-launch-search-engine-to-rival-google/">reiterated rumors</a> that Apple has considered creating its own search engine. Such a solution would be able to provide better privacy and deeper integration with <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a> and Spotlight, and Apple has already developed search tools that are used in apps like the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Apple's AI chief John Giannandrea heads up a search team within Apple, and according to Gurman, that team has created a next-generation search engine for Apple apps. Codenamed "Pegasus," the search technology is able to provide more accurate results. While it is already used in some Apple apps, Apple will be expanding it to additional apps, such as the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
What Apple has now does not match the Google search engine, but Gurman argues that Apple could use it as the backbone for a full search engine in the future.<br/>
<br/>
There are still a few more weeks to go in the antitrust trial, and it is not yet clear what the outcome will be. If lawmakers target the lucrative deal between Apple and Google, the billions of dollars that Apple will lose could serve as a catalyst for Apple to further pursue its own search engine option.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/google/">Google</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/microsoft/">Microsoft</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/bing/">Bing</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/02/microsoft-ceo-on-apple-goole-search-deal/">Apple Deal Responsible for Google&#039;s Dominance in Search, Says Microsoft CEO</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-deal-responsible-for-googles-dominance-in-search-says-microsoft-ceo.2405987/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[All first-generation Apple Watch models released in 2015 were added to Apple's obsolete products list on September 30, according to an internal memo obtained by <em>MacRumors</em>. As a result, these outdated "Series 0" watches are no longer eligible for repairs or other service at Apple Stores and Apple Authorized Service Provider locations.<br/>
<br/>

The list of obsolete models includes the first-generation Apple Watch Edition with an 18-karat gold casing, which cost up to &#36;17,000 in the U.S. when it was available. The solid-gold Apple Watch was discontinued in 2016 and replaced with a ceramic Apple Watch Edition, which was a more affordable luxury at up to &#36;1,299. On the software side, watchOS 5 dropped compatibility with the solid-gold Apple Watch in 2018.<br/>
<br/>
All other 38mm and 42mm aluminum and stainless steel versions of the original Apple Watch, including Hermès variants, are also now classified as obsolete.<br/>
<br/>
Apple classifies a product as technologically obsolete once more than seven years have passed since the company stopped distributing it for sale. The original Apple Watch was discontinued in September 2016 upon the release of Apple Watch Series 2 and Series 1 models, so the first-generation models recently crossed that seven-year mark.<br/>
<br/>
Apple has not yet updated its public-facing vintage and obsolete products list to reflect these additions, but that should happen soon.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[The third-generation <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-pencil/">Apple Pencil</a> could be available with a range of interchangeable tips to emulate different drawing styles, according to a sketchy rumor shared by the X (formerly Twitter) user known as "<a href="https://x.com/MajinBuOfficial/status/1708118363631743055?s=20">Majin Bu</a>."<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/10/m2-ipad-pro-apple-pencil-hover.jpeg" alt="" width="1280" height="596" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-869663" /><br/>
The next-generation &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; will apparently come with different tips for drawing, technical drawing, and painting that connect magnetically. Majin Bu did not share any further details about the device. After a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-pencil-3/">flurry of rumors</a> in 2021, rumors about a third-generation &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; model noticeably died down and nothing has been heard about the product until now.<br/>
<br/>
In March 2021, the leaker known as "Mr. White" shared an image purporting to depict a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/03/new-apple-pencil-allegedly-leaks/">next-generation Apple Pencil prototype</a> that featured a shorter design, glossy finish, and a larger, deeper tip. Apple was believed to have worked on a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/13/apple-working-on-smaller-apple-pencil/">smaller Apple Pencil</a> designed for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-mini/">iPad mini</a>, as well as a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/16/apple-planned-iphone-apple-pencil/">&#36;49 model for the iPhone</a>, but both products never emerged and are said to have been canceled entirely.<br/>
<br/>
It is worth noting that while Majin Bu often aggregates and shares information related to Apple's plans, they do not have a solid track record. The current &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; is the second-generation version introduced alongside the 2018 <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a>, meaning that it is one of the oldest Apple devices still on sale. As such, it is fairly likely that Apple has plans to launch a third-generation model at some point, and the company still <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2020/07/17/apple-pencil-color-sensor-patent/">files patents</a> on new technologies for the accessory, but the latest rumor should still be taken with a pinch of salt until it is corroborated.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-pencil/">Apple Pencil</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/majin-bu/">Majin Bu</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipad-accessories.139">iPad Accessories</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/02/apple-pencil-3-could-feature-magnetic-tips/">Apple Pencil 3 Could Feature Magnetic Tips for Different Drawing Styles, Sketchy Rumor Claims</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-pencil-3-could-feature-magnetic-tips-for-different-drawing-styles-sketchy-rumor-claims.2405953/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple recently started selling refurbished second-generation HomePod models for the first time in select countries, <a href="https://www.apple.com/uk/shop/product/FQJ83B/A/Refurbished-HomePod-2nd-Gen-White">including the U.K.</a>, Ireland, Germany, Italy, Spain, the Netherlands, Belgium, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, and others. Availability has yet to expand to the U.S., but the product listing is <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/FQJ73LL/A/Refurbished-HomePod-2nd-Gen-Midnight">already visible</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/01/HomePod-2-White-and-Midnight-Feature-Blue-Orange.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-881771" /><br/>
Prices are discounted by approximately 15% compared to a brand new HomePod. In the U.K., for example, a refurbished HomePod costs £249, down from £299. In the U.S., a refurbished HomePod will cost &#36;249, down from &#36;299.<br/>
<br/>
Apple says its certified refurbished HomePods undergo full functionality testing, and they are inspected, cleaned, and repackaged in a plain white box with the power cord and documentation. The refurbished HomePods are covered by Apple's limited one-year warranty policy, and they are eligible for extended AppleCare+ coverage.<br/>
<br/>
Released in January 2023, the second-generation HomePod has a similar design as the original HomePod that was discontinued in 2021, but with a larger backlit touch surface, two fewer tweeters, two fewer microphones, and a few other changes.

		<description><![CDATA[Apple this week stopped providing human technical assistance via direct messages on X, formerly known as Twitter, in a shift away from social media support.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/08/Apple-Support-App-General-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2250" height="1266" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-908138" /><br/>
As of October 1, customers who send a direct message to the <a href="https://twitter.com/applesupport">@AppleSupport account on X</a> receive an automated reply with links to the Get Support page on Apple's website, and to the Apple Support app for the iPhone and iPad. The account also appears to have stopped offering human replies to posts tagging the @AppleSupport account, but it still provides some automated replies with links to various pages on Apple's website.<br/>
<br/>
The account's description previously said it was "available every day to answer your questions," but that text was removed this week.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/Apple-Support-X.jpg" alt="" width="1179" height="364" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-914995" /><br/>
The account will continue to share tips, tricks, and helpful information, including videos from the Apple Support channel on YouTube.<br/>
<br/>
<em>MacRumors</em> was first to report that Apple was <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/30/apple-social-media-support-report/">planning to eliminate paid social media support advisor roles</a> across X, YouTube, and the Apple Support Community website. Apple offered affected employees the opportunity to transition to a phone-based support role in the company, according to sources familiar with the matter.<br/>
<br/>
One of the sources said that human support on the Apple Support Community will continue temporarily amid the transition to phone support. Responses to comments on videos uploaded to the Apple Support channel on YouTube appear to have stopped.<br/>
<br/>
Apple had offered human support on Twitter since 2016. Last year, the social media platform was controversially acquired by billionaire Elon Musk, but it's unclear if that was a factor in Apple's move towards automated support on the website.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-support/">Apple Support</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/02/apple-stops-offering-human-support-on-x/">Apple Support Account on X No Longer Offers Help From a Human</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-support-account-on-x-no-longer-offers-help-from-a-human.2405940/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/microled-apple-watch/">MicroLED</a> display technology will be the next major upgrade coming to the Apple Watch Ultra, according to a Weibo leaker with a proven track record for disclosing accurate information about Apple's plans.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/apple-watch-ultra-pink.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-913279" /><br/>
The account known as "<a href="https://weibo.com/u/5143897135">Instant Digital</a>" claims that the next worthwhile upgrade for the Apple Watch Ultra users will be Apple's custom microLED display technology, but the feature is not expected to launch next year. The source was <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/03/iphone-14-new-color-rumor/">first to report</a> the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-14/">iPhone 14</a>'s Yellow spring refresh, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/04/future-iphone-could-capture-spatial-photos-videos/">Spatial Video</a> on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a>, and the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch/">Apple Watch Series 9</a>'s <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/04/apple-watch-series-9-basically-unchanged/">minor refresh</a>, as well as the only rumor claiming that the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a> and &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; Plus would feature <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/17/iphone-15-and-15-plus-frosted-glass-rumor/">frosted back glass</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Apple's plan to bring a microLED display to the Apple Watch Ultra is very widely corroborated, starting with a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/01/10/microled-apple-watch-2025/">report</a> from display analyst Ross Young in January. TrendForce <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/07/04/apple-watch-ultra-microled-delayed-early-2026/">claims</a> that Apple's first microLED display will launch on a new Apple Watch Ultra model in 2026, due to supply chain adjustments, but some earlier reports placed the device's launch in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/27/apple-watch-ultra-second-half-2025/">2025</a>. The microLED display is expected to be 2.12-inches in size, a 10% increase over the display of the current Apple Watch Ultra.<br/>
<br/>
<em>Bloomberg</em>'s <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a> <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/01/15/apple-custom-displays-heading-to-iphone-ipad-and-mac-after-apple-watch/">reported</a> Apple is likely planning to bring custom microLED displays to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>, and Mac after the technology debuts in a new version of the Apple Watch Ultra. He believes Apple's long-term plan is to bring microLED displays to all of its key products. Other reports from <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/10/microled-iphone-report/"><em>DigiTimes</em></a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/18/apple-mass-produce-microled-iphone/"><em>Nikkei Asia</em></a>, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/06/apple-microled-struggle-led-to-reliance-on-samsung/"><em>The Information</em></a> have indicated similar plans for Apple to transition to custom microLED displays across multiple product lines in an effort to become less <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/06/apple-microled-struggle-led-to-reliance-on-samsung/">reliant on Samsung</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Apple is believed to have spent more than six years developing microLED technology for what will become the first display custom-designed by the company itself, mirroring its work on Apple silicon. Apple reportedly kicked off the current form of its microLED project, codenamed T159, around 2017. At an earlier stage, it even wanted to introduce the technology <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/06/apple-microled-struggle-led-to-reliance-on-samsung/">with the iPhone X</a>. The advanced display offers improved brightness, color reproduction, and viewing angles, making images look more like they are "painted" atop the display glass, and replace parts currently supplied by companies like Samsung and LG.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch-ultra/">Apple Watch Ultra 2</a></div><div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/micro-led/">Micro-LED</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/setsuna-digital/">Setsuna Digital</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/microled-apple-watch/">microLED Apple Watch</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch_Ultra">Apple Watch Ultra (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-watch.172">Apple Watch</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/02/next-major-apple-watch-upgrade-to-be-microled/">Next Major Apple Watch Ultra Upgrade Rumored to Be MicroLED Display Technology</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/next-major-apple-watch-ultra-upgrade-rumored-to-be-microled-display-technology.2405936/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

There are multiple complaints from <em>MacRumors</em> readers (<a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-watch-ultra-brightness-issues.2361676/page-4">1</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-watch-ultra-2-aod-too-dim.2404865/">2</a>), Reddit users (<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AppleWatch/comments/16rbcj8/apple_watch_ultra_2_inconsistent_display_issues/">1</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AppleWatch/comments/16sfez8/ambient_light_sensor_behavior_is_this_expected/">2</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AppleWatch/comments/16tb1g5/new_ultra_2_barely_useable_in_the_dark_while/">3</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AppleWatch/comments/16przfx/apple_watch_ultra_2_brightness/">4</a>), and <a href="https://discussions.apple.com/thread/255146215?page=7">Apple Community users</a> who say that they are unable to read information on the Apple Watch Ultra display in dark environments because the screen is too dim, suggesting the device's ambient light sensor has not been properly calibrated to increase brightness to an adequate level. <br/>
<br/>
Launched last month, the Apple Watch Ultra 2 pushes the maximum screen brightness to 3,000 nits, making it the brightest Apple Watch ever, according to Apple. The display is also capable of reducing brightness to as low as 1 nits.<br/>
<br/>
Some Ultra 2 owners have pinned the blame on this new hardware specification, however the recent uptick in reports also includes users of the first-generation Apple Watch Ultra, suggesting it is an issue with Apple's watchOS 10 software update, which was released in September.<br/>
<br/>
Users say the issue is particularly pronounced when quickly moving from a bright room to a dark area, and when the Wayfinder and Ultra Modular watch face is set to Night mode, which puts a red filter on the display. Legibility issues persist despite manual adjustments to the brightness level in the watch's Settings. Both Ultra and Ultra 2 owners say the problem is evident on models updated with watchOS 10.0.1 and the latest <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/26/apple-releases-watchos-10-0-2/">watchOS 10.0.2 update</a>. <br/>
<ul><li><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/apple-watch-ultra-how-to-activate-night-mode/">Apple Watch Ultra: How to Activate Night Mode</a></li></ul><br/>
Apple is reportedly aware of the issue, so hopefully a future software update will remedy the situation. Have you experienced difficulty reading information on the Apple Watch Ultra's screen in low light? Let us know in the comments.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[If you have an iPhone 15 and drive a BMW, it might be best to avoid charging the device with the vehicle's wireless charging pad for now.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/BMW-Logo-iPhone-15-Pro.jpg" alt="" width="1489" height="744" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-914891" /><br/>
Over the past week, some BMW owners have complained that their iPhone 15's NFC chip no longer works after charging the device with their vehicle's wireless charging pad, according to comments shared <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-15-pro-apple-pay-issue-bmw-related.2404307/">on the MacRumors Forums</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/DeeSoS3xy/status/1707882090107465845">X</a>, formerly known as Twitter. Affected customers say the iPhone goes into a data recovery mode with a white screen, and the NFC chip is no longer functional after the device reboots.<br/>
<br/>
In an iPhone, the NFC chip powers features like Apple Pay and digital car keys. Affected users receive a "Could Not Set Up Apple Pay" error message in the Wallet app, and there does not appear to be a way to fix the problem. Some customers say Apple replaced their iPhone after confirming the NFC chip failed, but the replacement iPhone is then vulnerable to the same issue, so there is currently no permanent solution.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/Apple-Pay-Error.jpg" alt="" width="1179" height="658" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-914890" /><br/>
While complaints so far have come from iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max users, it is possible the iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus are also affected, so owners of any iPhone 15 model should proceed with caution until this issue is sorted.<br/>
<br/>
It's unclear what the specific cause of the issue is, how many customers are affected, and which BMW models are affected. We've reached out to an Apple spokesperson for comment, and we'll update this story if we receive a response.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/bmw/">BMW</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-15">iPhone 15 (Buy Now)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-15-Pro">iPhone 15 Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99">iPhone</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/01/bmw-charging-may-break-iphone-15-nfc-chip/">Warning: BMW Wireless Charging May Break iPhone 15&#039;s Apple Pay Chip</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/warning-bmw-wireless-charging-may-break-iphone-15s-apple-pay-chip.2405806/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today said it <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/30/apple-responds-to-iphone-15-pro-overheating/">plans to release an iOS 17 software update</a> with a bug fix for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/28/iphone-15-pro-overheating-reports/">iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max overheating issue</a>, and the company has since shared additional details about the matter with <em>MacRumors</em>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/iPhone-15-Pro-Cameras.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-913544" /><br/>
Importantly, Apple said the issue is not related to the titanium frame. <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/26/iphone-15-pro-overheating/">Contrary to a report</a> this week, Apple said the iPhone 15 Pro's design does not contribute to overheating. In fact, Apple said the titanium frame and aluminum substructure provide better heat dissipation than any previous-generation Pro models with stainless steel frames.<br/>
<br/>
Apple said some third-party apps have overloaded the A17 Pro chip for unknown reasons, including Instagram, Uber, and racing game Asphalt 9: Legends, and it is working with the developers of these apps to address the matter. Apple said its bug fix will not involve reducing the chip's performance in order to address the temperature-related issue, and it ensured that long-term performance will not be impacted.<br/>
<br/>
To reiterate Apple's statement:<blockquote>We have identified a few conditions which can cause iPhone to run warmer than expected. The device may feel warmer during the first few days after setting up or restoring the device because of increased background activity. We have also found a bug in iOS 17 that is impacting some users and will be addressed in a software update. Another issue involves some recent updates to third-party apps that are causing them to overload the system. We're working with these app developers on fixes that are in the process of rolling out.</blockquote>More details are available in our <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/30/apple-responds-to-iphone-15-pro-overheating/">initial coverage of Apple's statement</a>.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-17/">iPadOS 17</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-15-Pro">iPhone 15 Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-17.241">iOS 17</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-17.242">iPadOS 17</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/30/apple-iphone-15-pro-overheating-details/">Apple Says iPhone 15 Pro&#039;s Titanium Frame Does Not Contribute to Overheating Issue</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-says-iphone-15-pros-titanium-frame-does-not-contribute-to-overheating-issue.2405695/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

Apple also says some recent updates to third-party apps have overloaded the system and contributed to the overheating issue. The report notes that some of these apps include Instagram, Uber, and the racing game Asphalt 9: Legends, and Apple is working with the developers of these apps to address the issue. The report adds that Instagram already introduced a fix as part of an update to the app released on Wednesday.<br/>
<br/>
Apple says iPhone 15 Pro models may run warmer than expected during the first few days after setting up or restoring the device due to increased background activity. This is standard behavior for new iPhones and only a temporary condition.<br/>
<br/>
Apple's statement:<blockquote>We have identified a few conditions which can cause iPhone to run warmer than expected.

It's quite possible that Apple might also make a bug fix available sooner with a smaller software update, such as iOS 17.0.3.<br/>
<br/>
According to the report, Apple will not be reducing the performance of the A17 Pro chip as part of the temperature-related bug fix. Apple also said the issue is not a safety risk and will not impact the long-term performance of affected iPhones.<br/>
<br/>
Apple said the iPhone 15 Pro's titanium frame and aluminum substructure <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/30/apple-iphone-15-pro-overheating-details/">do not contribute to the overheating issue</a>, ruling out a hardware problem.<br/>
<br/>
Not all iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max users have experienced overheating, and it's unclear how many customers are affected by the issue overall, but it should be resolved soon.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-17/">iPadOS 17</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-15-Pro">iPhone 15 Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-17.241">iOS 17</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-17.242">iPadOS 17</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/30/apple-responds-to-iphone-15-pro-overheating/">Apple to Address iPhone 15 Pro Overheating Issue With iOS 17 Update</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-to-address-iphone-15-pro-overheating-issue-with-ios-17-update.2405682/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Mac fans, rejoice! You can now enjoy the upgrades that come with macOS Sonoma, which was released to the public this week just a bit later than the major updates for the rest of Apple's platforms.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/top-stories-30sep2023.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-914635" /><br/>
Apple isn't stopping there, of course, and it's already begun seeding iOS 17.1, macOS Sonoma 14.1, and other upcoming updates to developers and public beta testers. This week also saw some fresh rumors about the iPhone 16 (yes, already!), while discussion continues over thermal issues with the iPhone 15 Pro and Apple's controversial FineWoven accessories, so read on for all the details on these stories and more!<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Apple Releases macOS Sonoma With Desktop Widgets, Game Mode, and More</h2><br/>
<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/26/apple-releases-macos-sonoma/">macOS Sonoma was released to the public this week</a> following over three months of beta testing. The free software update includes many new features and changes for the Mac, including interactive desktop widgets, a Game Mode, the ability to add websites to the Dock as web apps, several Safari improvements, and more.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/macos-sonoma-4.jpg" alt="" width="2336" height="1314" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-900182" /><br/>
We've shared a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/macos-sonoma-features/">list of macOS Sonoma features worth checking out</a>, and additional details about the software update can be found in our in-depth <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sonoma/">macOS Sonoma roundup</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Everything New in iOS 17.1 Beta 1</h2><br/>
Less than two weeks after Apple released iOS 17, the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/28/apple-seeds-ios-17-1-public-beta-1/">first beta of iOS 17.1</a> is already available. As usual, there are a handful of new features and changes coming to the iPhone with this software update for Apple Music, AirDrop, and more.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/iOS-17.1-Feature-Purple.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-912331" /><br/>
We've put together <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/27/ios-17-1-beta-1-features/">a list of everything new in the first beta of iOS 17.1</a> with more details. The beta is now available for both developers and public beta testers.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>iPhone 16 to Include an Additional Capacitive 'Capture' Button</h2><br/>
Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/25/iphone-16-capture-button/">plans to add a new capacitive button to iPhone 16 models</a> that is internally known as the "Capture Button," according to <em>MacRumors</em> sources.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/iPhone-16-Side-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="3532" height="1986" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-913689" /><br/>
It's unclear what this button will be used for, but given that it is expected to be positioned below the power button on the right side of the iPhone, it could be a more conveniently placed shutter button for the camera when shooting in landscape orientation.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>22 New Features You May Have Missed in watchOS 10</h2><br/>
watchOS 10 is now available for the Apple Watch Series 4 and newer, and the software update includes several new features and changes.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/22-Hidden-Features-in-watchOS-10-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2248" height="1264" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-913396" /><br/>

<h2>iPhone 15 Pro Overheating Concerns Highlighted in Two More Reports</h2><br/>
<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/28/iphone-15-pro-overheating-reports/">iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max overheating concerns</a> continue to make headlines this week, with the topic highlighted by <em>The Wall Street Journal</em> and <em>Bloomberg</em>. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/iPhone-15-Pro-lineup.jpg" alt="" width="2880" height="1620" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-910338" /><br/>
Apple supply chain analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said the titanium frame on iPhone 15 Pro models <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/26/iphone-15-pro-overheating/">negatively impacts thermal efficiency</a>. Kuo believes that Apple will likely address the issue through future software updates, but he said improvements might be limited.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Apple's FineWoven Cases for iPhone 15 Continue to Be Heavily Criticized</h2><br/>
Apple's new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/25/finewoven-iphone-case-continued-criticism/">FineWoven cases for iPhone 15 models have been heavily criticized</a> since they were released earlier this month, with some customers and media outlets complaining about the fabric exterior being prone to scratches and stains.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/iPhone-15-Pro-FineWoven.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-913676" /><br/>
We <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/21/apples-finewoven-iphone-cases-poor-reviews/">recapped some of the negative feedback</a> last week, and the complaints have continued to surface. Apple has not commented on the matter so far.<br/>
