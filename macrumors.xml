		<description><![CDATA[T9 dialing, or Text on 9 keys, is a predictive text technology that emerged in the late 90s to make it easier to type text messages on devices with limited input options, such as traditional mobile phones with numeric keypads. Each number key (2-9) on a T9 keypad is mapped to a set of letters. For example, the key "2" corresponds to "ABC," "3" to "DEF," and so on.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/t9-dialing-phone-keypad-ios-18.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-955980" /><br/>
Android phones have had the feature for years, and in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a> beta, Apple has finally added T9 dialing support to the Phone App. So now you can type a contact's name using the number pad, and matching contacts will appear above the keypad.<br/>
<br/>
When you press a key, T9 doesn't just consider the individual letters that the key represents but predicts the most likely word you are trying to type. In the same way, &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj; combines all possible letter combinations to filter results from your contacts. To bring up your Dad's number, for example, you would tap 3-2-3 (D-A-D). Or if you have someone called Ben in your contacts, tapping 2-3-6 (B-E-N) should bring up their number.<br/>
<br/>
The best match appears first above the keypad, and tapping the person's name will call them. If there are several possible matches in your contacts, they can be revealed as a list by tapping "X more..." below the first match. Taken together, the new options should enable faster calling.<br/>
<br/>

In addition, when you type in a new number into the keypad in &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj;, it now gives you two options to add it to your contacts. In <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a>, a single "Add number" option appears above the keypad, whereas in &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj; there is a new button in the top-left corner that reveals "Create New Contact" and "Add to Existing Contact."<br/>
<br/>
&zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj; is currently in beta for Apple Developer Program members, with a public beta to follow in July. The update should be widely released in September.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-18/">iPadOS 18</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-18.244">iOS 18</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-18.245">iPadOS 18</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/18/ios-18-phone-app-keypad-t9-dialing/">Apple&#039;s Phone App Finally Supports T9 Dialing in iOS 18</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apples-phone-app-finally-supports-t9-dialing-in-ios-18.2429503/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<title>U.S. Government Sues Adobe for Hidden Termination Fees When Canceling Subscription</title>

		<description><![CDATA[The United States Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission today <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/united-states-files-complaint-against-adobe-and-two-adobe-executives-alleged-violations">levied a lawsuit against Adobe</a> [<a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/media/1356176/dl?inline">PDF</a>] for imposing a hidden termination fee on subscribers who want to cancel their Adobe plans. Adobe is accused of forcing subscribers to "navigate a complex and challenging cancellation process designed to deter them from cancelling subscriptions they no longer wanted."<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/adobe-creative-cloud-purple.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-950293" /><br/>
Adobe offers its Creative Cloud products on a subscription basis, with fees that are paid monthly. A monthly payment suggests that it's possible to cancel anytime, but that's not how Adobe works because most customers are actually locked into a hidden annual agreement.<br/>
<br/>
Customers who sign up for a free trial and are then charged and signed up to the default Creative Cloud plan, which is actually an annual contract. Canceling the annual contract requires customers to pay a lump sum of 50 percent of the "remaining contractual obligation" to cancel, despite the fact that service ends that month.<br/>
<br/>
Adobe <em>does</em> let customers sign up for a month-to-month subscription plan, but at a higher cost than the annual contract that's paid monthly, and the difference is not always clear to new or existing customers. Adobe even has <a href="https://helpx.adobe.com/manage-account/using/creative-cloud-subscription-terms.html">a whole help page</a> because of the confusing nature of its subscription. If you look at the Adobe website, for example, Adobe lists a &#36;60/month fee for accessing its full suite of apps, but that's only if you agree to the annual contract. A true month-to-month plan that you can cancel anytime is &#36;90/month, and if you pay for a year upfront, you get no money back when you cancel after a 14-day period.<br/>
<br/>
According to the DoJ, Adobe's setup violates the Restore Online Shoppers' Confidence Act (ROSCA) through the use of fine print and inconspicuous hyperlinks to hide information about the Early Termination Fee.<br/>
<blockquote>The complaint alleges that for years, Adobe has profited from this hidden fee, misleading consumers about the true costs of a subscription and ambushing them with the fee when they try to cancel, wielding the fee as a powerful retention tool.<br/>
<br/>
The complaint alleges that Adobe has further violated ROSCA by failing to provide consumers with a simple mechanism to cancel their recurring, online subscriptions. Instead, Adobe allegedly protects its subscription revenues by thwarting subscribers' attempts to cancel, subjecting them to a convoluted and inefficient cancellation process filled with unnecessary steps, delays, unsolicited offers and warnings.</blockquote><br/>
The lawsuit asks for "unspecified amounts of consumer redress" along with monetary civil penalties and a permanent injunction that would prevent Adobe from continuing to use hidden fees to thwart customer cancelations.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ftc/">FTC</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/adobe/">Adobe</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/doj/">DOJ</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/17/us-government-sues-adobe-hidden-fees/">U.S. Government Sues Adobe for Hidden Termination Fees When Canceling Subscription</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/u-s-government-sues-adobe-for-hidden-termination-fees-when-canceling-subscription.2429478/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/watchos-11/">watchOS 11</a> appears to include a new feature that allows an Apple Watch to automatically detect and record when you're taking a nap. As <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/iOSBeta/comments/1dh5hzm/ios_18_db_1_nap_detection/">shared on Reddit</a>, an Apple Watch owner took a nap and was able to see the sleep data recorded in the Health app, despite not putting the device in Sleep Mode.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/watchOS-11-Thumb-2-1.jpg" alt="" width="2560" height="1440" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-955941" /><br/>
Right now, the Apple Watch only tracks and records sleep when it is in Sleep Mode, and there is no support for tracking naps.<br/>
<br/>
The change should allow an Apple Watch running &zwnj;watchOS 11&zwnj; to record and include a nap in the Sleep section of the Health app, and it may also support automatic sleep tracking even when Sleep Mode isn't activated. Nap tracking has long felt like a missing feature from the Apple Watch, and this will be a welcome feature for those who supplement sleep with naps.<br/>
<br/>

Apple did not mention a change to the Sleep app in its preview information for &zwnj;watchOS 11&zwnj;, and the only mention of sleep is related to the new Vitals app, which collects data for your health metrics during sleep in order to populate a typical range feature.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/watchos-10/">watchOS 10</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/watchos-11/">watchOS 11</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-watch.172">Apple Watch</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/17/watchos-11-supports-automatic-nap-detection/">watchOS 11 Supports Automatic Nap Detection</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/watchos-11-supports-automatic-nap-detection.2429472/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple appears to be planning to unveil its new Beats Pill speaker on Tuesday, June 25, according to a teaser shared on social media site X (formerly Twitter) today.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-949655" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/New-Beats-Pill-iOS-17.5-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" /><br/>
The Beats by Dre account posted a short video starring LeBron James and featuring the Beats Pill speaker, with the text "6/25," which seemingly hints at the debut date of the device.<br/>
<br/>
Signs of a new Beats Pill speaker first surfaced in April when NBA superstar LeBron James was spotted <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/20/lebron-james-unreleased-beats-pill/">carrying it in a photo</a>. It was later spotted with F1 driver <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/02/unreleased-beats-pill-daniel-ricciardo/">Daniel Ricciardo</a>, soccer star Lionel Messi, and Kim Kardashian.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="und" dir="ltr">6/25. <a href="https://twitter.com/KingJames?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@KingJames</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/LilTunechi?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@LilTunechi</a> <a href="https://t.co/NkpLlTeVhJ">pic.twitter.com/NkpLlTeVhJ</a></p>&mdash; Beats by Dre (@beatsbydre) <a href="https://twitter.com/beatsbydre/status/1802824048474562753?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 17, 2024</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div><br/>
Our first real look at the speaker came in May with images <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/07/apple-beats-pill-ios-17-5/">hidden in the iOS 17.5 beta</a>, and since then, it has been spotted in multiple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/28/new-beats-pill-speaker-on-apple-regulatory-website/">regulatory databases</a>.<br/>
<br/>
While no official details have surfaced on the Beats Pill feature set, it has a pill-shaped design that's similar to the Beats Pill speaker that was <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/01/10/beats-pill-discontinued/">discontinued in 2022</a>. The new model includes a lanyard that was not provided with prior speakers, and based on the iOS 17.5 leak, we know it will come in gold, red, and black. Other likely features include upgraded Bluetooth 5.3, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/find-my-network-accessory-program/">Find My</a> integration, and USB-C charging, all of which are upgrades Apple has been adding across its product lineup.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/beats/">Beats</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/17/apple-teases-june-25-beats-pill-unveiling/">Apple Teases June 25 Beats Pill Unveiling</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-teases-june-25-beats-pill-unveiling.2429465/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple shared <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/ios-ipados-release-notes/ios-ipados-18-release-notes">iOS 18 beta release notes</a> on its developer website last week, and they reveal some smaller changes related to FaceTime, Siri, and the Wallet app.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/Generic-iOS-18-Feature-Real-Mock.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-954594" /><br/>
iOS 18 is currently in beta for Apple Developer Program members, with a <a href="https://beta.apple.com/">public beta</a> to follow in July. The update should be widely released in September.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>FaceTime</h2><br/>
Apple says FaceTime will use more data in Low Power Mode on iOS 18 when network conditions are good, for improved video call quality.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Siri</h2><br/>
iOS 18 includes a new setting that can "significantly" improve Siri's audio quality in Bluetooth-enabled vehicles that lack CarPlay, according to Apple.<br/>
<br/>
The new option can be found in the Settings app under Siri → Siri Responses → "Respond over Media Source." The description for this setting says that "Siri will respond over A2DP car stereos, which is ideal while listening to media from your phone."<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Wallet</h2><br/>
As noted <a href="https://x.com/nicolas09F9/status/1802785545195798549">by Nicolás Álvarez</a>, the notes indicate that users adding an ID to the Wallet app on the iPhone may now be asked to take a Live Photo instead of, or in addition to, conducting a series of head and facial movements. Apple says the Live Photo will be evaluated by the device to ensure that the real and rightful person is adding the ID.<br/>
<br/>
Apple first announced the ability to add a driver's license or ID to the Wallet app in 2021, but <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/14/apple-wallet-app-ids-slow-adoption/">only four U.S. states have rolled out the feature</a> so far, including Arizona, Maryland, Colorado, and Georgia. The feature provides a convenient and contactless way to display proof of identity or age at select airports, businesses, and venues.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-18/">iPadOS 18</a></div><div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/facetime/">FaceTime</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-wallet/">Apple Wallet</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-18.244">iOS 18</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-18.245">iPadOS 18</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/17/ios-18-facetime-siri-wallet-changes/">iOS 18 Beta Notes Reveal More Changes for FaceTime, Siri, and Wallet</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-18-beta-notes-reveal-more-changes-for-facetime-siri-and-wallet.2429456/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple will launch its annual Back to School promotion for university students in the United States and Canada this week, according to <a href="https://pro.twitter.com/i/decks/1572255292661895168"><em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-851334" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/06/2022-back-to-school-apple-feature.jpg" alt="" width="2178" height="1224" /><br/>
Apple's back to school sales provide students with a free Apple gift card when purchasing a Mac or an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>, and this year's promotion could help Apple push the new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m2/">M2</a> <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/">iPad Air</a> and M4 <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a> models. Last year, Apple offered U.S. students <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/06/06/apple-launches-2023-back-to-school-promotion/">up to &#36;150</a> when purchasing a Mac and up to &#36;100 when purchasing an &zwnj;iPad&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
Apple actually began advertising its Back to School sale on social networks <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/04/apple-back-to-school-2024-sale-soon/">in early June</a>, with some Instagram users seeing an ad promoting Macs with discounts to college and university students.<br/>
<br/>
The ad depicted a Back to School image with the following text: "Buy Mac for university or college with education savings. Plus get a gift card for up to &#36;200." The screenshot of the ad was from a Canadian user, and that price point suggests we will see the same &#36;150 discount in the United States that Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/06/06/apple-launches-2023-back-to-school-promotion/">provided last year</a>.<br/>
<br/>

Clicking on the ad redirected to Apple's education website, but the ad seems to have gone up early as there has been no sign of a Back to School promotion as of yet. Last year's back to school sale began on Monday, June 5. <br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/17/back-to-school-2024-launching-this-week/">Apple&#039;s 2024 Back to School Sale Launching This Week</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apples-2024-back-to-school-sale-launching-this-week.2429448/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple is discontinuing <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-pay/">Apple Pay</a> Later, the buy now, pay later feature that it <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/24/apple-pay-later-launches/">just launched last October</a>. &zwnj;Apple Pay&zwnj; Later is being discontinued as of today, but people who have existing &zwnj;Apple Pay&zwnj; Later loans will be able to continue to pay them off and manage them through the Wallet app.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/Apple-Pay-Later-feature-1.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-918417" /><br/>
Apple announced plans to end the feature in a statement provided to <em><a href="https://9to5mac.com/2024/06/17/apple-pay-later-united-states-ending/">9to5Mac</a></em>, which also notes that customers will be able to access installment loans through their credit and debit cards with changes coming to &zwnj;Apple Pay&zwnj; this fall.<blockquote>Starting later this year, users across the globe will be able to access installment loans offered through credit and debit cards, as well as lenders, when checking out with Apple Pay. With the introduction of this new global installment loan offering, we will no longer offer Apple Pay Later in the U.S. Our focus continues to be on providing our users with access to easy, secure and private payment options with Apple Pay, and this solution will enable us to bring flexible payments to more users, in more places across the globe, in collaboration with Apple Pay enabled banks and lenders.</blockquote>Apple Pay Later officially launched in October and only in the United States, but it had been available in a testing capacity since March 2023. Available in the Wallet app, &zwnj;Apple Pay&zwnj; later allowed customers to split a purchase made with &zwnj;Apple Pay&zwnj; into four equal payments over a six week period, with no interest or fees. &zwnj;Apple Pay&zwnj; Later was available on purchases made on an iOS device using &zwnj;Apple Pay&zwnj;, and was limited to merchandise priced between &#36;75 and &#36;1,000. Each purchase required a separate loan application and approval.<br/>
<br/>
Apple did not provide insight into why it is discontinuing &zwnj;Apple Pay&zwnj; Later, but it is working to unravel its partnership with Goldman Sachs, the company that handles the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-card/">Apple Card</a>, the Apple Savings account, and &zwnj;Apple Pay&zwnj; Later. Nixing &zwnj;Apple Pay&zwnj; Later means that Apple does not need to worry about replacing that functionality with a future partner.<br/>
<br/>
In <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a>, Apple will let users access installment financing options from their bank when using &zwnj;Apple Pay&zwnj;, which will replace the &zwnj;Apple Pay&zwnj; Later feature that Apple is eliminating. &zwnj;Apple Pay&zwnj; will also gain support for viewing rewards or points balances in Wallet and redeeming them with purchases.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-pay-later/">Apple Pay Later</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/17/apple-discontinuing-apple-pay-later/">Apple Discontinuing Apple Pay Later</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-discontinuing-apple-pay-later.2429447/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a> includes many new features for the iPhone, but not all of them will be available when the update is initially released in September.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/Generic-iOS-18-Feature-Real-Mock.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-954594" /><br/>
Below, we have listed all of the features that will not be available until a later version of iOS 18, according to Apple's website. The features should begin rolling out with iOS 18.1 in October and iOS 18.2 in December, with more to follow next year.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Mail Categorization</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/iOS-18-Mail-Categorization.png" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-955888" /><br/>
In an update to iOS 18 coming later this year, the Mail app will gain four new categories powered by on-device intelligence:<br/>
<br/>
<ul><li><strong>Primary:</strong> Personal and time-sensitive emails</li><br/>
<li><strong>Transactions:</strong> Receipts and confirmation emails</li><br/>
<li><strong>Updates:</strong> News and social media notifications</li><br/>
<li><strong>Promotions:</strong> Marketing emails and coupons</li></ul>These categories will be available on devices set to English, and All Mail will remain an option.<br/>
<br/>
The app will also be getting a new digest view that shows emails from a single business, such as various emails from United Airlines ahead of a flight.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Some Apple Intelligence Features</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/iOS-18-Siri-Personal-Context.png" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-955889" /><br/>
A subset of Apple Intelligence features will be available on iPhone 15 Pro models and newer when iOS 18 is publicly released in September, but only with the device language set to U.S. English. The features will have a "preview" label initially.<br/>
<br/>
On its Apple Intelligence page, Apple says "some features, additional languages, and platforms will be coming over the course of the next year," but the company has not shared specific details. In his <em>Power On</em> newsletter last weekend, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-06-16/when-is-apple-intelligence-coming-some-ai-features-won-t-arrive-until-2025-lxhjh86w"><em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman said</a> some Siri features powered by Apple Intelligence are unlikely to launch until 2025, including personal context, on-screen awareness, and deeper per-app controls. He also said Apple Intelligence will not support additional languages or regions until next year.<br/>
<br/>
Gurman does expect Siri's redesign and more natural voice on the initial release of iOS 18, along with Apple Intelligence features that can improve your writing, prioritize notifications, summarize messages, generate custom emoji, and more. <br/>
<br/>
<h2>Control Robot Vacuums With Siri</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/Roomba-and-HomeKit-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-955897" /><br/>
Robot vacuum support in the Home app is coming an update to iOS 18 later this year, allowing you to ask Siri to clean your floors and so forth.<br/>
<br/>
Apple says the Home app will support the "core functionality" of robot vacuum cleaners, such as vacuuming, mopping, power control, cleaning mode, and charge status. Robot vacuums will also work with automations and scenes in the app.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Electricity Usage in Home App <span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 22px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #4e6c99; padding: 3px 6px; border-radius: 4px;">U.S. Only</span></h2><br/>
Another new feature coming to the Home app in an update to iOS 18 later this year is the ability to view your home's electricity usage right in the app. This feature will be available for Pacific Gas and Electric Company customers in the U.S. who have residential electrical service, so long as they are the account owner or an authorized user.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-18/">iPadOS 18</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-18.244">iOS 18</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-18.245">iPadOS 18</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/17/ios-18-features-coming-in-ios-18-1-or-later/">These iOS 18 Features Aren&#039;t Coming to iPhones Until iOS 18.1 or Later</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/these-ios-18-features-arent-coming-to-iphones-until-ios-18-1-or-later.2429446/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

<br/>
tvOS software releases are usually minor in scale compared to other operating system updates, focusing primarily on smaller improvements rather than outward-facing changes. We don't yet know what's included in tvOS 17.6.<br/>
<br/>
Apple shares some information on tvOS releases in its <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207936">tvOS support document</a>, which is updated after each tvOS launch, but Apple does not provide notes during beta testing.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today seeded the first betas of upcoming iOS 17.6 and iPadOS 17.6 updates to developers for testing purposes, with the software coming a few weeks after the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ios-17-5-features/">launch of iOS 17.5</a> and iPadOS 17.5.<br/>

Registered developers are able to opt into the betas by opening up the Settings app, going to the Software Update section, tapping on the "Beta Updates" option, and toggling on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a> or <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-17/">iPadOS 17</a> Developer Beta.

<br/>
The features Apple promised for &zwnj;iOS 17&zwnj; have all been implemented, so it is not clear what will be included in iOS 17.6. It is expected to be one of the final feature updates to &zwnj;iOS 17&zwnj;, as Apple will soon transition most of its focus to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a>. <div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-17/">iPadOS 17</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-17.241">iOS 17</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-17.242">iPadOS 17</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/17/apple-seeds-ios-17-6-beta-1-to-developers/">Apple Seeds First Betas of iOS 17.6 and iPadOS 17.6 to Developers</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-seeds-first-betas-of-ios-17-6-and-ipados-17-6-to-developers.2429435/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a> adds many new features to the Messages app, including the ability to schedule messages to be sent later, the ability to use any emoji or sticker as a Tapback, text formatting options like bold and italics, and much more.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/iOS-18-Messages-Feature-1.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-955693" /><br/>
iOS 18 is currently available in beta for members of the Apple Developer Program, with a public beta to follow in July. The software update should be widely released in September, and it is compatible with the iPhone XS and newer.<br/>
<br/>
Below, we outline everything new in the Messages app on iOS 18, including some smaller changes that Apple's website does not mention.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Schedule Messages</h2><br/>
iMessages can now be scheduled to be sent at a later date and time in both individual and group conversations. As of the first iOS 18 beta, you can schedule a message to be sent up to 14 days later. After scheduling a message, it becomes visible to you in a dotted-line bubble, with edit, delete, and reschedule options.<br/>

<h3>Improved Visibility</h3><br/>
It is now easier to view multiple Tapback reactions on a single message.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Text Formatting and Effects</h2><br/>
Bold, italics, underline, and strikeout formatting is finally available for iMessages. In addition, there are all-new text effects that can animate words within an iMessage, including Big, Small, Shake, Nod, Explode, Ripple, Bloom, and Jitter.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/iMessage-iOS-18-1.jpeg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-954499" /><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/iOS-18-Text-Effects-iMessage.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-955785" /><br/>
<h2>Messages via Satellite <span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 22px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #4e6c99; padding: 3px 6px; border-radius: 4px;">U.S. Only</span></h2><br/>
iOS 18 allows you to send and receive both iMessages and SMS messages via a satellite connection, even if there is no emergency.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/iOS-18-Messages-via-Satellite.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-955787" /><br/>
This feature will work with messages, emoji, and Tapbacks, and all iMessages sent over satellite are secured with end-to-end encryption.<br/>
<br/>
Messages via satellite is available on all iPhone 14 models and newer in the U.S. only at launch.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/13/ios-18-messages-via-satellite-first-look/">Hands-on demo videos</a> show the feature in action.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>RCS Support <span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 22px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #4e6c99; padding: 3px 6px; border-radius: 4px;">Later This Year</span></h2><br/>
Apple's website says that iOS 18 will support RCS (Rich Communication Services) in the Messages app. While this feature is not enabled in the first iOS 18 beta, Apple said it will be rolled out later this year, likely by time iOS 18 is widely released.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/iOS-18-WWDC-Slide.png" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-955808" /><em>WWDC keynote slide confirming RCS support on iOS 18</em></div><br/>
RCS support will result in the following improvements to the default messaging experience between iPhones and Android devices:<ul><br/>
 <li>Higher-resolution photos and videos</li><br/>
 <li>Audio messages</li><br/>
 <li>Typing indicators</li><br/>
 <li>Read receipts</li><br/>
 <li>Wi-Fi messaging</li><br/>
 <li>Improved group chats, including the ability for iPhone users to leave a conversation that includes Android users</li></li><br/>
</ul>SMS continues to be supported as well.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Emoji and Link Card Changes</h2><br/>
When you send a message with only a single emoji, it now appears even larger than before.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/iMessage-iOS-18-Link-Cards.jpg" alt="" width="2358" height="1323" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-955800" /><br/>
Link cards are now more colorful, with the background better matching the linked content.<br/>
<br/>
For some links, you can now choose between full-size and compact link cards, and there is an option to send a link as plain text instead.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Other Changes</h2><br/>
<ul><li>Any app can be <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/10/ios-18-hide-lock-apps/">locked behind Face ID</a>, Touch ID, or an iPhone's passcode on iOS 18, including the Messages app.</li><br/>
<li>iOS 18 can <a href="https://x.com/rjonesy/status/1801636095219929407">solve math equations in the text field</a> of any app, including the Messages app.</li><br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple is not expected to introduce its most significant Apple Intelligence features in September when ‌iOS 18‌ sees a public release. Instead, many will come alongside a Siri overhaul in a future ‌iOS 18‌ update that's set to be introduced in 2025. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/apple-intelligence.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-954498" /><br/>
That doesn't mean Siri will not have any improvements when iOS 18 initially launches. According to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-06-16/when-is-apple-intelligence-coming-some-ai-features-won-t-arrive-until-2025-lxhjh86w"><em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman</a>, Siri in iOS 18 will still have some "new bells and whistles" come September, including a new interface that glows a light around the edge of the screen, richer natural language capabilities that will allow Siri to understand you even if you stumble over your words, a greater knowledge of Apple products to power on-device support, and a Type to Siri option for entering queries via text.<br/>
<br/>
But according to Gurman, we will have to wait until next year to see Apple's most significant enhancements to Siri. An iOS 18 update in 2025 should bring with it the following improvements to Apple's virtual assistant:<br/>
<ul><li><strong>Personal Context: </strong>Siri will have the ability to draw from your photos, calendar events, Messages, and other apps to inform responses to queries. Apple gave an example of a person asking when their mom's flight is landing, which Siri figured out based on recent text conversations and emails.</li><br/>
<li><strong>Semantic indexing:</strong> Apple Intelligence creates an on-device semantic index to store data retrieved from your emails, images, websites you visit, and apps you use.</li><br/>
<li><strong>App Control:</strong> ‌Siri will be able to‌ control all individual features in apps for the first time, expanding the range of functions the personal assistant can perform. ‌Siri‌ will be able to do things like open specific documents, move a note from one folder to another, delete an email, summarize an article, email a web link, and open a particular news site in Apple News. </li><br/>
<li><strong>On-screen awareness:</strong> With onscreen awareness, Siri will be able to understand and take action with users' content in more apps over time. For example, if a friend texts a user their new address in Messages, the receiver can say, "Add this address to his contact card."</li></ul>Like these Siri improvements, Apple Intelligence features will initially only support American English, and support for additional languages and regions won't arrive until 2025. <br/>
<br/>
<h2>AI Updates Coming Later in 2024</h2><br/>
Gurman notes that some of the Mail app's new AI features won't be ready until "later in 2024." These include a redesign that can group emails in categories like newsletters, announcements and shopping. Swift Assist, a new programming companion for Xcode that uses cloud-based AI models, is similarly not expected to arrive until later in the year. Siri integration with ChatGPT may also miss the initial release, though Gurman thinks it should be ready later in 2024, based on language Apple has used in its marketing materials. <br/>
<br/>
Going on past release timelines, these features are likely to arrive in an iOS 18.1 or iOS 18.2 update around October or December.<br/>
<br/>
Despite the missing enhancements, the initial version of Apple Intelligence will still offer a plethora of features, according to Gurman. It will leverage AI to prioritize notifications and provide quick recaps of your alerts and text messages. The software will also have the capability to summarize webpages, voice memos, meeting notes, and emails. Additionally, it will introduce new writing tools, image generation, and custom AI-generated emojis called Genmoji. <div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-18/">iPadOS 18</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/">Apple Intelligence</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-18.244">iOS 18</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-18.245">iPadOS 18</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/17/apple-siri-improvements-coming-2025/">iOS 18: These Apple Intelligence Features Won&#039;t Be Ready Until 2025</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-18-these-apple-intelligence-features-wont-be-ready-until-2025.2429408/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple intends to slim down the MacBook Pro, Apple Watch, and iPhone, with the new ultra-thin M4 iPad Pro a sign of the company's new design trajectory, according to <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/iPod-Nano-vs-iPod-Pro-Ad-Feature-1.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="721" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-949953" /><br/>
When the M4 iPad Pro was unveiled last month, Apple touted it as the company's thinnest product ever, and even compared it to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/08/ipod-nano-appears-in-new-ipad-pro-ad/">2012 iPod nano</a> to emphasize its slim dimensions. <br/>
<br/>
Writing in the latest edition of his <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-06-16/when-is-apple-intelligence-coming-some-ai-features-won-t-arrive-until-2025-lxhjh86w">Power On newsletter</a>, Gurman says that like the iPad Pro, Apple is now focused on delivering the thinnest possible devices across its lineups without compromising on battery life or major new features.<br/>
<br/>
Gurman writes that the new iPad Pro is the "beginning of a new class of Apple devices," and that Apple's aim is to offer "the thinnest and lightest products in their categories across the whole tech industry."<br/>
<br/>
Apple now reportedly has its sights on making thinner versions of iPhone, Apple Watch, and MacBook Pro over the next couple of years.<br/>
<br/>
Gurman's sources tell him Apple is now focused on developing a significantly skinnier iPhone in time for the iPhone 17 line in 2025, corroborating a May report by <em>The Information</em>. According to the latter report, Apple is planning to launch an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/17/slimmer-iphone-17-major-redesign-rumor/">all-new thinner iPhone 17</a> model next year that will allegedly feature a "major redesign" akin to the iPhone X.<br/>
<br/>
Gurman previously <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/13/gurman-apple-watch-x-redesign-planned/">reported</a> that Apple is planning a complete revamp of the Apple Watch for the device's tenth anniversary, dubbed "Apple Watch X." <br/>
<br/>
Since the original Apple Watch was unveiled in 2014 and launched in 2015, Gurman is unsure whether the ‌Apple Watch X‌ will be released in 2024 or 2025. However, Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo today <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/17/kuo-apple-watch-series-10-larger-screen-thinner/">claimed</a> that this year's upcoming Apple Watch will have a larger screen and thinner design, which sounds like the sort of major overhaul and design signature that Gurman has suggested.<br/>
<br/>
In 2021, Apple significantly redesigned the MacBook Pro, making it thicker and heavier. A major highlight of the redesign was the reintroduction of several ports that were removed in previous iterations in favor of chassis thinness. MacBook Pro models now include an HDMI port, an SD card slot, MagSafe 3 charging port, three Thunderbolt 4 (USB-C) ports, and a headphone jack. <div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17/">iPhone 17</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/17/apple-plans-thinner-iphone-slimmer-macbook/">Apple Developing Thinner MacBook Pro, Apple Watch, and iPhone</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-developing-thinner-macbook-pro-apple-watch-and-iphone.2429400/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This year's Apple Watch Series 10 will be thinner and come in larger screen sizes than previous models, according to Apple analyst <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/">Ming-Chi Kuo</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/08/apple-watch-series-9-display.jpeg" alt="" width="1960" height="1102" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-913380" /><br/>
In his latest industry note <a href="https://medium.com/@mingchikuo/2h24-新款apple-watch關注焦點-series-10-鉑力特-3d列印-the-focus-of-the-2h24-new-apple-watch-series-10-and-98075c44ce92">shared on Medium</a>, Kuo said the screen size options on the next-generation Apple Watch will increase from 41mm to 45mm, and from 45mm to 49mm, while being encased in a thinner design. For reference, the Apple Watch Ultra has a 49mm case.<br/>
<br/>
As for Apple Watch Ultra, Kuo said it will remain "roughly the same" this year, although if production yields meet expectations, a new dark/black case color option could be made available.<br/>
<br/>
Apple will also start using 3D printing technology to manufacture Apple Watch components later this year, following extensive testing which has significantly improved the production efficiency. Kuo said BLT will be the supplier of 3D-printed components.<br/>
<br/>
<em>Bloomberg</em> previously <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/13/gurman-apple-watch-x-redesign-planned/">reported</a> that the 2024 Apple Watch could be labeled the "<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-watch-x/">Apple Watch X</a>" to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the Apple Watch, but Kuo made no mention of this possibility in his latest note. <em>Bloomberg</em> also said that Apple is considering a magnetic band attachment system that will allow the design to be made thinner, but it is unclear whether the system will be ready or present on the 2024 Apple Watch.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch/">Apple Watch Series 9</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/">Ming-Chi Kuo</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch">Apple Watch (Caution)</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/17/kuo-apple-watch-series-10-larger-screen-thinner/">Kuo: Apple Watch Series 10 to Get Larger Screen and Thinner Design</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/kuo-apple-watch-series-10-to-get-larger-screen-and-thinner-design.2429393/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>
