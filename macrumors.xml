		<description><![CDATA[The first approved Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) emulator for the iPhone and iPad was made <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/bimmy-nes-emulator/id1528825236">available on the App Store</a> today following Apple's rule change. The emulator is called <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/bimmy-nes-emulator/id1528825236">Bimmy</a>, and it was <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/nes-emulator-bimmy.2424312/">developed by Tom Salvo</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/04/iOS-NES-Emulator-Bimmy-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-946735" /><br/>
On the App Store, Bimmy is described as a tool for testing and playing public domain/"homebrew" games created for the NES, but the app allows you to load ROMs for any NES games available for download online, such as Super Mario Bros. and Donkey Kong. Nintendo released the NES game console in 1985, so some of these games are nearly 40 years old. On its <a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/55888/~/intellectual-property-%26-piracy-faq">website</a>, Nintendo says "downloading of pirate copies of Nintendo games is illegal."<br/>
<br/>
The release of Bimmy comes after <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/15/apple-further-explains-igba-removal/">Apple removed Game Boy emulator iGBA from the App Store</a> for ripping off another emulator known as GBA4iOS, which was distributed outside the App Store. Apple said it had approved of iGBA's functionality prior to learning that the app was a knockoff, suggesting that emulators for older Nintendo game consoles are permitted on the App Store, and Bimmy seems to be the first proof of that.<br/>
<br/>
Apple updated its App Review Guidelines to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/05/app-store-guidelines-emulators-music-app-links/">permit retro game console emulators</a> earlier this month. Apple says developers of emulators are "responsible for all such software" offered in the app, including compliance with "all applicable laws."<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/emulator/">Emulator</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/16/nes-emulator-bimmy-for-iphone-in-app-store/">NES Emulator for iPhone and iPad Now Available on App Store</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/nes-emulator-for-iphone-and-ipad-now-available-on-app-store.2424326/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple will launch its next Apple Watch activity challenge on Saturday, April 22 in celebration of Earth Day.<br/>
<br/>

To complete the challenge, Apple Watch owners will need to complete a workout that lasts for 30 minutes or longer, with the activity recorded through the Workout app or an app that adds information to the Health app.<blockquote>Let's get moving for the planet. On April 22, do any workout for 30 minutes or more to earn this award. Record it with the Workout app or any app that adds to Health.</blockquote>Apple Watch owners who earn the award will unlock a dedicated in the Fitness app, plus they will get a series of animated stickers that can be used in the Messages and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/facetime/">FaceTime</a> apps.<br/>

After the Earth Day challenge, Apple will also launch another challenge for International Dance Day, which takes place on April 29. The Dance Day award can be earned by completing a dance workout that lasts 20 minutes or longer, and it too will unlock a badge and animated stickers. <br/>

		<title>New iOS 17.5 Beta Lets EU iPhone Users Download Apps Directly From Websites</title>

		<description><![CDATA[With the second beta of iOS 17.5 that's available today, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> users located in the European Union are able to download apps directly from the websites of Apple app developers without going through the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a> or an alternative app marketplace.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/04/Apple-EU-iOS-Changes-Orange-1.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-946723" /><br/>
<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/12/apple-announces-app-downloads-from-websites/">Since March</a>, Apple has been working on support for downloading apps from websites, and the feature is finally ready for testing. Apple started letting developers offer their apps through alternative app marketplaces in the EU in iOS 17.4, but the website option adds a new method for acquiring apps.<br/>
<br/>
App developers that want to offer iOS apps from their websites in the European Union <a href="https://developer.apple.com/support/web-distribution-eu/">need to meet specific criteria</a> to ensure the safety of &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; users. Apps must undergo Apple's Notarization process, and developers need to be a member of the Apple Developer Program for two continuous years or more.<br/>
<br/>
Only apps that have had one million annual first installs or more on iOS in the EU in the prior year are eligible for download from a website. Developers that meet these terms will be able to use an API for web-based app downloads. Apps downloaded through the web using the API can be backed up, restored, and updated as standard apps can.<br/>
<br/>
When an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; user in the EU visits a website to install an app, users will need to grant express permission for that developer to install apps to Settings. A system sheet will display the app name, developer name, app description, screenshots, and more.<br/>
<br/>
Developers are only able to offer apps from their developer account, and are required to publish transparent data collection policies so users are aware of how data is collected and used. Apps distributed outside of the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; need to provide customer support, refunds, and offer a way to manage apps.<br/>
<br/>
While developers do not have to pay a cut of app sales to Apple for apps distributed through websites, there is a 0.50 euro Core Technology Fee for each annual install over one million in the past 12 months. The fee is waived for nonprofit organizations, accredited educational institutions, and government entities.<br/>
<br/>
Downloading apps outside of the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; is limited to &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; users who are located in the European Union, and Apple has implemented these options to comply with the EU's Digital Markets Act. The functionality is not available on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>, nor is it open to &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; users in other countries.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-17/">iPadOS 17</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-17.241">iOS 17</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-17.242">iPadOS 17</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/16/ios-17-5-app-web-downloads-eu/">New iOS 17.5 Beta Lets EU iPhone Users Download Apps Directly From Websites</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/new-ios-17-5-beta-lets-eu-iphone-users-download-apps-directly-from-websites.2424313/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

To install the ‌watchOS 10.5 update, developers need to open the Apple Watch app, go to the Software Update section under "General" in Settings, and toggle on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/watchos-10/">watchOS 10</a> Developer Beta.

<br/>
Once beta updates have been activated, watchOS 10.5 can be downloaded under the same Software Update section. To install software, an Apple Watch needs to have 50 percent battery life and it must be placed on an Apple Watch charger.<br/>

We don't yet know what's included in watchOS 10.5, and there were no new features found in the first beta.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/watchos-10/">watchOS 10</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-watch.172">Apple Watch</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/16/apple-seeds-watchos-10-5-beta-2-to-developers/">Apple Seeds Second Beta of watchOS 10.5 to Developers</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-seeds-second-beta-of-watchos-10-5-to-developers.2424321/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today seeded the second beta of an upcoming tvOS 17.5 to developers for testing purposes, with the beta coming two weeks after the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/02/apple-seeds-tvos-17-5-beta-1-to-developers/">release of the first beta</a>.<br/>
<br/>

Registered developers are able to download the tvOS 17.5 update by opting in to the beta through the Settings app on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a>. A registered developer account is required.<br/>
<br/>
tvOS software updates are often minor in scale compared to other operating system updates, focusing primarily on smaller improvements rather than outward-facing changes. We don't yet know what's included in tvOS 17.5.<br/>
<br/>
Apple shares some information on tvOS releases in its <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207936">tvOS support document</a>, which is updated after each tvOS launch, but Apple does not provide notes during beta testing.<br/>
<br/>
Though we don't always know what's new in tvOS betas, we let <em>MacRumors</em> readers know when new updates are available so those who are developers can download new software upon release.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_TV">Apple TV (Caution)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-tv-and-home-theater.100">Apple TV and Home Theater</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/16/apple-seeds-tvos-17-5-beta-2-to-developers/">Apple Seeds Second Beta of tvOS 17.5 to Developers</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-seeds-second-beta-of-tvos-17-5-to-developers.2424319/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today shared a new iPhone ad called "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlU4Bb3z5wg">Goodbye Leather</a>" on its YouTube channel in the U.K., months after the company controversially switched from leather to a much-criticized "FineWoven" fabric material for accessories.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JlU4Bb3z5wg?si=sW3fdSUe2c2rmdqc" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><br/>
Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/12/apple-announces-finewoven/">discontinuing leather accessories</a> for environmental benefits was a noble aspiration, but FineWoven accessories have been <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/21/apples-finewoven-iphone-cases-poor-reviews/">very poorly received</a>. Just days after the first FineWoven cases were released for the iPhone, some customers and media outlets complained about the fabric exterior being prone to scratches and stains. A photo of a FineWoven case with a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/25/finewoven-iphone-case-continued-criticism/">misaligned USB-C port cutout</a> also surfaced.<br/>
<br/>
<em>The Wall Street Journal</em>'s Joanna Stern said her FineWoven case <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/26/finewoven-iphone-cases-brown-like-rotten-banana/">was "browning like a rotten banana"</a> after five months of usage.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/finewoven-case-stern.jpeg" alt="" width="3000" height="1999" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-938281" /><em>Image Credit: Joanna Stern/The Wall Street Journal</em></div><br/>
"The edges are peeling, the fabric is scratched up like an old CD and it's browning like a rotten banana," she wrote, in her <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/sign-up-for-tech-things-with-joanna-stern-11666299694"><em>Tech Things</em> newsletter</a>. "I've been waiting for the CDC to show up at my house to declare it a biomedical concern."<br/>
<br/>
Apple has yet to comment on FineWoven criticism, and it remains to be seen if the company discontinues the line or improves the material in any way.<br/>

		<title>All iPhone 16 Models to Feature Action Button, But Usefulness Debated</title>

		<description><![CDATA[Last September, Apple's iPhone 15 Pro models debuted with a new customizable Action button, offering faster access to a handful of functions, as well as the ability to assign Shortcuts. Apple is poised to include the feature on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/30/iphone-16-action-button-all-models/">all upcoming iPhone 16 models</a>, so we asked iPhone 15 Pro users what their experience has been with the additional button so far.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/iPhone-15-Pro-Action-Button-Translate.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-911022" /><br/>
The Action button replaces the switch that activates Ring and Silent on Apple's iPhone 15 Pro models, while the standard iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus models retain the traditional Ring/Silent switch. By default, the Action button still activates these two functions via a long press, but users can also make it activate a range of other functions, including quickly opening the camera app or enabling the flashlight, activating Voice Memos, Focus modes, Translate, and accessibility features like Magnifier. <br/>
<br/>
Of around 7,000 <em>MacRumors</em> readers who <a href="https://x.com/MacRumors/status/1779882443941597638">responded to our poll</a> on social media, just over half (50.6%) said they often forgot the Action button is even there, while over a quarter of respondents (26.8%) said they use the Action button "occasionally." Based on readers who commented, most occasional users assigned the camera or flashlight to the Action button – functions that are also easily accessible via the Lock screen. A subsection of users in the same category said they have the Action button set to activate/deactivate Mute, to mimic the physical Mute switch it replaced.<br/>
<ul><li><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/iphone-15-pro-how-to-customize-action-button/">iPhone 15 Pro: How to Customize the Action Button</a></li></ul><br/>
Some respondents (12.6%) agreed with the description that the Action button is a "game changer." Most users in this category used it to activate custom Shortcuts, which allowed for novel uses like skipping forward in podcasts, adding to-dos, prompting ChatGPT, activating smart lights, or opening a folder. Some in this category simply appreciated the fact that it saved them time accessing more standard functions that would otherwise involve navigating through onscreen menus.<br/>
<br/>
The rest of our poll respondents (10%) agreed that the Action button was something of a "volume decoy," implying that they often pressed it by accident when they intended to adjust audio levels via the volume buttons, usually when their iPhone was in a pocket or purse.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">With the Action button introduced on the iPhone 15 Pro set to expand to all models later this year, we want to hear from current users: Does it make your iPhone life easier?</p>&mdash; MacRumors.com (@MacRumors) <a href="https://twitter.com/MacRumors/status/1779882443941597638?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 15, 2024</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div><br/>
Our social media poll represents a small, self-selecting cohort of iPhone 15 Pro users. It is also an example of convenience sampling, and by no means statistically sound. Even so, it seems the case could be made that many people have had trouble finding a dedicated use case for the Action button. <br/>
<br/>
Assigning the button to the camera appears to be the most popular way to increase the likelihood that it gets used. Launching the camera app like this avoids having to press or swipe the Lock Screen or select the Camera app from the Home screen. However, Apple is rumored to be adding a "<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/17/iphone-16-capture-button-video/">Capture button</a>" to the iPhone 16 for video recording, so the Action button might get less useful for those who use it for this purpose.<br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile, anecdotal evidence suggests there is a fair amount of frustration among "power users" that Apple has not added more flexibility to the way the Action button works. Currently the button only responds to a long press, but more sophisticated iPhone users want a built-in ability to set different customizations for short presses, double-presses, and triple presses. <br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Ahead of Earth Day on April 22, Apple has added a banner to its website that reminds customers they can recycle their Apple devices "for free" with the company's recycling partners. The process can be initiated on Apple's <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/trade-in">trade-in page</a> in many countries, with customers able to submit a form to receive a prepaid shipping label for their devices.<br/>
<br/>

"We'll recycle your Apple devices, cables, cases, accessories, and other similar electronics for free," says Apple. "You'll help protect the earth's precious resources and reduce waste as we work toward a better future for the planet."<br/>
<br/>
On a related note, Apple today shared a new <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksHnnuP4DKQ">"Recycling Robots" video</a> on its YouTube channel in the U.K. that says Apple's recycling robots are now able to recover recyclable materials from a total of 23 different iPhone models.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ksHnnuP4DKQ?si=CnyFrf4HIGbGTChx" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><br/>

"Our custom recycling robot Daisy can disassemble 23 different iPhone models to recover crucial materials like gold and rare earth elements," <a href="https://www.apple.com/uk/iphone/more/">says</a> Apple. "Robot Dave extracts tungsten from Taptic Engines, while robot Taz takes care of audio modules. Together, they're leading the way in recovering recycled materials for the next generation of products."<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Spotify's elusive lossless music experience is being teased again, this time based on code uncovered by <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/12/24128584/spotify-music-pro-lossless-audio">The Verge</a></em> in recent builds of the Spotify app for Android.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/08/General-Spotify-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1407" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-810756" /><br/>
More than three years have elapsed since Spotify announced its intention to offer a "HiFi" premium option that would give users access to a catalog of CD-quality music tracks. Originally the company said the tier would go live by the end of 2021, but a shift in the wider streaming market upended that idea.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/">Apple Music</a> has since rolled lossless listening into its standard subscription price, while Amazon stopped charging extra for its lossless music library. The moves effectively kiboshed Spotify's original strategy of marketing an exclusively lossless HiFi tier.<br/>
<br/>
That said, it doesn't sound as if lossless is coming as a free perk. The latest rumors suggest that Spotify now aims to offer lossless audio playback in an optional "Music Pro" add-on that will also include new DJ remix features, which let subscribers "speed up, mash-up, and otherwise edit" tracks from their favorite artists, according to <em><a href="https://www.wsj.com/business/media/spotify-to-let-users-play-dj-competing-with-remixes-on-tiktok-da35e25c">The Wall Street Journal</a></em>.<br/>
<br/>
Spotify will likely make some basic remixing tools available as part of its Premium subscription (currently &#36;10.99 a month, or &#36;5.99 for students), but more powerful tools will be part of its "Music Pro" add-on. Where recent rumors of a new top "Supremium" tier fit in is unclear. <br/>

The intended price of the premium add-on has not been revealed, but given that major rivals include lossless in their standard plans, expecting subscribers to pay anything more than a nominal fee may be a big ask.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/spotify/">Spotify</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/16/spotify-lossless-option-music-pro-add-on/">Elusive Spotify Lossless Option May Arrive as Paid &#039;Music Pro&#039; Add-on</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/elusive-spotify-lossless-option-may-arrive-as-paid-music-pro-add-on.2424285/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple will allegedly offer both the iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max with a minimum 256GB of storage, doing away with the 128GB starting option on its smaller Pro model for the first time.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/iPhone-16-Pro-Front-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-928695" /><br/>
Currently, Apple's 6.1-inch iPhone 15 Pro starts at &#36;999 and comes with the minimum 128GB of storage, while the 6.7-inch iPhone 15 Pro Max starts at &#36;1,199 with a minimum 256GB of storage.  <br/>
<br/>
However, according to <a href="https://www.macobserver.com/news/apple-could-launch-iphone-16-pro-with-256gb-base-storage/"><em>The Mac Observer</em></a>, Apple will bump up the base storage of the upcoming iPhone 16 Pro to 256GB to match the minimum capacity of the larger iPhone 16 Pro Max, while the starting price of Apple's smaller Pro model will remain at &#36;999.<br/>
<br/>
The source of the alleged "leak" has no recent track record for accurate Apple rumors, so we are filing this one under sketchy. Having said that, the claim is not outside the realm of possibility. If Apple drops 128GB as the base on the iPhone 16 Pro, that will leave three Pro storage options across the board: 256GB, 512GB, and 1TB. <br/>
<ul><li><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/is-128gb-enough-iphone-storage/">Is 128GB Enough iPhone Storage?</a></li></ul><br/>
In 2018, Apple's iPhone X came with 64GB, an entry-level storage tier that persisted in successive premium device generations until the iPhone 12 Pro in 2020, when Apple adopted 128GB as the new baseline. The next year saw all iPhone 13 models offered with a minimum 128GB. If Apple makes 256GB the new minimum across its premium devices this year, we could well see it reach all models in 2025.<br/>
<br/>
At the other end of the scale, a rumor in January out of Korea <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/19/iphone-16-pro-2tb-option-rumor/">claimed</a> that both iPhone 16 Pro models will be available with double the maximum storage capacity as the iPhone 15 Pro devices, increasing from 1TB to 2TB. <br/>
<br/>
The maximum storage increase is said to be a result of Apple's switch to higher-density Quad-Level Cell (QLC) NAND flash for higher storage models. Apple's use of QLC NAND could allow Apple to fit more storage into a smaller space and it is less expensive than Triple-Level Cell (TLC) NAND, which current iPhones use. <br/>

This year's iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max are rumored to be getting <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/08/iphone-16-pro-larger-display-sizes/">bigger display sizes</a>, increasing to 6.27- and 6.86-inches, respectively. For comparison, the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max are equipped with 6.1-inch and 6.7-inch displays, respectively. The new display sizes will be the largest ever for the iPhone, and should also increase the physical space for internal components and parts.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Adobe <a href="https://news.adobe.com/news/news-details/2024/Adobe-previews-breakthrough-AI-innovations-to-advance-professional-video-workflows-within-Adobe-Premiere-Pro/">today debuted</a> several new AI features for Premiere Pro, software designed for professional video editing. Adobe's Premiere Pro is set to gain useful editing functions powered by generative AI, which will let video editors do more with less work.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe title="Generative AI in Premiere Pro powered by Adobe Firefly Adobe Video" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6de4akFiNYM" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div><br/>
With a Generative Extend feature, Premiere Pro will be able to add frames to make video clips longer, allowing for properly timed edits and smooth transitions by extending a scene.<br/>
<br/>
Objects in videos will also be able to be added or removed through smart selection and tracking tools. Adobe says that video editors can do things like remove an unwanted item, change an actor's wardrobe, or add set dressings like paintings on the wall or plants on a desk.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps the most interesting new feature is an option to create new video footage directly within Premiere Pro using a text to video feature. Users will be able to type text into a prompt or upload images to create video, and the resulting clips can be used for B-roll, creating storyboards, and more.<br/>
<br/>
Adobe plans to introduce these generative AI tools later in 2024.<br/>
<br/>
Apple has its own professional video editing software, Final Cut Pro. Final Cut Pro is a Premiere Pro competitor, and as of now, it is lacking in the AI department. Apple has not announced any AI features for Final Cut Pro, but with AI capabilities rumored to be coming to multiple apps in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-15/">macOS 15</a>, we could perhaps see some new AI feature additions for Final Cut Pro.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/adobe/">Adobe</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/15/adobe-premiere-pro-ai-tools/">Adobe Premiere Pro Gains AI Tools to Add and Remove Objects From Videos, Extend Clips and More</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/adobe-premiere-pro-gains-ai-tools-to-add-and-remove-objects-from-videos-extend-clips-and-more.2424261/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Social media platform X (formerly Twitter) will soon begin charging new users "a small fee" for posting content and liking, replying, and bookmarking tweets, according to Elon Musk.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/07/X-twitter-logo.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-904140" /><br/>
<a href="https://twitter.com/xDaily/status/1779927679493411209">X Daily News</a>, a feed that posts X updates, today noticed that text strings on the website have been updated to mention a small annual fee that new users will need to pay in order to access the social network.<br/>
<br/>
Musk <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1779930065469383166">said in response</a> that the fee for new users is "the only way to curb the relentless onslaught of bots."<br/>
<br/>
The fee has previously been tested in New Zealand and the Philippines, and Musk says that it is applicable only to those who are new to Twitter. When a new user signs up, the user will need to pay the fee, or wait for three months to be able to engage on the network. The updated language on the Twitter site:<br/>
<blockquote>New accounts are required to pay a small annual fee before you're able to post, like, bookmark, and reply. This is to reduce spam and create a better experience for everyone. You can still follow accounts and browse X for free.</blockquote><br/>
The text does not mention being able to post for free after three months, but <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1779939517278957714">Musk confirmed</a> that "write actions" would be free after that time period.<br/>
<br/>
It is unclear how the policy will stop spam accounts and bots, as spammers will be able to pay the fee or simply create multiple accounts and wait to be able to post. Regular users, meanwhile, could be discouraged from using X due to the extra step and the fact that other social networks are free.<br/>
<br/>
The fee appears to be around &#36;1, as it costs &#36;1.75 NZD in New Zealand. The pay-for-access policy has not yet been implemented outside of New Zealand and the Philippines.<br/>
<br/>
Musk said that fake accounts also use up "the available namespace" limiting the "good handles." X has freed up over a million usernames so far, and will "free up tens of millions in the coming weeks."<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/15/x-small-fee-new-users/">X May Charge New Users a &#039;Small Fee&#039; to Post, Like and Reply</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/x-may-charge-new-users-a-small-fee-to-post-like-and-reply.2424255/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Dock accessory company <a href="https://shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=2178566&u=63177&m=132800&urllink=&afftrack=">iVANKY</a> recently launched its most powerful Thunderbolt dock yet, the <a href="https://shrsl.com/4hpkr">FusionDock Max 1</a>, which takes advantage of dual Thunderbolt chips and connections to offer the greatest amount of versatility I've seen in a Mac-focused dock. I've spent some time testing out the FusionDock Max 1 in my daily workflow, and I think I've found my new daily driver.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/04/ivanky-fusiondock-max-1-installed.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-946576" /><br/>
What sets the FusionDock Max 1 apart from other Thunderbolt docks on the market is the inclusion of dual Thunderbolt 4 chips, which essentially doubles the capacity of the dock, allowing you to run all sorts of displays and other peripherals at maximum speed. We'll dig into what that means for connectivity in just a minute, but let's start with an overview of the design and setup. Note that the FusionDock Max 1 is only compatible with Apple silicon Macs, so it won't work with older Intel Macs, Windows PCs, or Chromebooks.<br/>
<br/>
The FusionDock Max 1 offers an eye-catching design in something of a midnight-colored aluminum housing. Rather than just featuring a simple brick shape, the FusionDock Max 1 has a unique "floating" design with a thin metal frame on the left side and bottom of the dock and the main body of the dock elevated on small legs. The design might help ensure some airflow around the dock, though I'm not sure just how much it actually assists in that regard. The dock can definitely get fairly warm during use, but I've never found it to get so hot that it's uncomfortable to leave a hand on it.<br/>
<br/>
Similar to the Satechi USB-C Dual Dock Stand that I <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/review/satechi-usb-c-dual-dock-stand/">recently reviewed</a>, the FusionDock Max 1 uses a dual-cable connection to your Mac, but this is Thunderbolt rather than the slower USB, so the greater bandwidth opens up a lot more possibilities for connectivity. The custom cable includes rather bulky housing on each end with a fixed arrangement of the two Thunderbolt connectors to match the port spacing on the dock and Apple's laptops. This makes it super easy to plug in and unplug the cable in one motion with very little fiddling required to get the connectors lined up properly.<br/>
<br/>
The dock measures in at around 6.7 inches (17 cm) wide, 3.7 inches (9.4 cm) deep, and a little under 2 inches (5 cm) high, and there's a separate 180-watt power brick. The brick does have a fairly bright green light on it that could be distracting in dark rooms, but most users should be able to tuck it away on the floor or elsewhere where it won't be bothersome.<br/>
<br/>
The dock itself has smooth surfaces on all sides, and it can tend to slide around on surfaces if it's bumped or even just under any sort of tension from the attached cables. Fortunately, iVANKY includes some sticky rubber pads you can install for either horizontal or vertical orientation of your dock, and those go a long way toward making sure the dock stays where you want it.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/04/ivanky-fusiondock-max-1-rear.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="553" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-946578" /><br/>
The dock's 20 ports are clearly labeled, which is great simply because there are so many that it's tricky to keep track of all of them. Aside from the DC-in barrel plug connection for power, everything is driven through a pair of 40 Gbps Thunderbolt USB-C ports stacked vertically on the rear on panel of the dock. iVANKY provides a custom cable with a vertically arranged dual connector on one end to fit these ports and a horizontally arranged dual connector on the other end to fit the exact spacing of adjacent Thunderbolt ports on your Mac.<br/>
<br/>
Once you've hooked the dock up to power and your computer, your Mac will recognize the dock and you'll need to grant a couple privacy-related permissions, and then you'll be ready to go. The dock can deliver up to 96 watts of power to a connected computer, so you won't need a separate power connection for your Mac.<br/>
<br/>
In addition to the DC-in and upstream Thunderbolt ports, the rear of the dock features two additional 40 Gbps USB-C ports that can drive up to 6K displays at 60Hz, and they can each provide up to 15 watts of power. For other types of displays, there are two HDMI ports supporting up to 4K displays at 60Hz, and while the ports officially support HDMI 2.1, iVANKY is only advertising them as supporting HDMI 2.0 due to Apple's limitations on docking stations connecting over USB-C/Thunderbolt.  There are also three 10 Gbps USB-A ports delivering up to 7.5 watts of power each, a 2.5 Gb Ethernet port, a 3.5 mm audio out port, and a Toslink optical audio out port. A Kensington lock slot is also included to help physically secure the dock if desired.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/04/ivanky-fusiondock-max-1-front.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="734" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-946579" /><br/>
On the front of the dock, you'll find another pair of 40 Gbps Thunderbolt USB-C ports capable of driving up to 6K displays at 60Hz, a pair of 10 Gbps USB-C ports (one with 20-watt Power Delivery capabilities and one offering 7.5 watts), another pair of 10 Gbps USB-A ports with 7.5 watts of power, plus a 3.5 mm combo headphone/mic audio port and SD and TF/microSD slots supporting the UHS-II standard. There is a white LED on the front to indicate whether the dock has power, but it's dim enough that it's not bothersome in a dark room.<br/>
<br/>
With this array of ports, the FusionDock Max 1 can support up to four external displays, but it depends on which Mac you have, as that's where the graphics horsepower is ultimately coming from. If you've got a Mac with the base <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m1/">M1</a>, or <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m2/">M2</a> chip such as a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/">MacBook Air</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-mini/">Mac mini</a>, or entry-level MacBook Pro, you can only drive a single external display at up to 6K resolution. M3-based machines like the latest &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; and entry-level MacBook Pro models should be able to drive a pair of displays as long as your Mac is in clamshell mode with the display off.<br/>
<br/>
If you've got a Mac with an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m1-pro/">M1 Pro</a>, &zwnj;M2&zwnj; Pro, or M3 Pro chip such as a higher-end &zwnj;Mac mini&zwnj; or a mid-level MacBook Pro, you'll be able to drive dual displays at up to 6K via the dock in additional to an internal display for the MacBook Pro, and if you've got a Max or Ultra chip from any of those families, you can drive a total of four external displays at up to 6K resolution.<br/>
<br/>
It's important to keep in mind that only the USB-C ports support 6K resolution, but there are four downstream ones available for display connections, two on the front and two on the back. The HDMI ports on the back can only support a maximum of 4K resolution.<br/>
<br/>
I don't have any machines in my possession equipped with Max-level chips, so I wasn't able to push the FusionDock Max 1 to its limit when it comes to displays, but it had no trouble driving a pair of 5K displays from my 16-inch MacBook Pro with an &zwnj;M1 Pro&zwnj; chip. I tried several other combinations of displays over Thunderbolt/USB and HDMI, including <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/review/alogic-clarity-max-touch-display/">Alogic's 32-inch 4K display with touchscreen support</a>, and everything worked without a hitch.<br/>
<br/>
Other peripherals also worked well with the dock, from my USB-A Stream Deck to a fast external SSD that was able to achieve speeds of up to 2,800 MB/s read and 1,950 MB/s write when connected to one of the 40 Gbps USB-C ports. Connecting that drive directly to my MacBook Pro yields read speeds of around 3,000 MB/s and write speeds of around 3,100 MB/s, so there's only a small penalty to read speeds for going through the dock, while write speeds take a bit bigger hit but remain speedy. Read and write speeds will ultimately depend on what else is connected to the dock and thus what that SSD is sharing its connection with.<br/>
<br/>
SD card speeds came in at around 90 MB/s read and 90–160 MB/s write depending on file size for the reasonably fast card I had available for testing, which is below both the theoretical specs of the card and the up to ~200 MB/s speeds I see in some testing when inserting it directly into my MacBook Pro, but still satisfactory in my opinion.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Wrap-up</h2><br/>
I've been a loyal CalDigit TS3 Plus user for many years, but the iVANKY FusionDock Max 1 is likely to take its place in my permanent desk setup. With a single-cable connection (yes, it has dual connectors, but just one thing to plug and unplug), it's the most convenient way to quickly and easily convert my MacBook Pro from a large desk setup to a convenient on-the-go machine.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/04/ivanky-fusiondock-max-1-parts.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="706" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-946577" /><br/>
With the FusionDock Max 1's vast array of ports, everything from my dual 5K displays to external drives, a Stream Deck, and more can all be connected and disconnected with almost no effort, and there's essentially no compromise in performance or speed.<br/>
<br/>
All of this convenience and technology packed into the FusionDock Max 1 doesn't come cheap, however, as it carries a normal price of &#36;549.99, so this dock definitely won't be everyone, but for power users this may be well worth the price tag. Fortunately, iVANKY is <a href="https://shrsl.com/4hpkr">currently offering &#36;150 off</a> when you use our exclusive promo code MACRUMOURS on iVANKY's site, bringing the price to &#36;399.99.<br/>

<h3 id="release_date">Release Date</h3><br/>
The &zwnj;iPhone 16 Pro&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPhone 16 Pro&zwnj; Max are expected to launch in the fall. Apple usually hosts an event every September to unveil new &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; models, with launch following just over a week later. For more information about the &zwnj;iPhone 16 Pro&zwnj; models, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/">see our comprehensive roundup</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="will_it_be_worth_upgrading">Will It Be Worth Upgrading?</h2><br/>
The &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; was a fairly significant upgrade over the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-14/">iPhone 14</a> Pro in 2023, introducing a new design with a titanium frame, slimmer bezels, the Action button, a USB-C port, and more. The &zwnj;iPhone 16 Pro&zwnj;'s upgrades will likely not be as substantial as those offered by its predecessor. As a result, most &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; users will have little reason to upgrade, but some who would appreciate a larger display, better cameras, and a dedicated button for photography and videography features may find it worthwhile.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/">iPhone 16 Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-15-Pro">iPhone 15 Pro (Neutral)</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone-15-pro-vs-iphone-16-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro vs. iPhone 16 Pro: 30 Rumored Upgrades Compared</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-15-pro-vs-iphone-16-pro-30-rumored-upgrades-compared.2419268/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/21/apple-sports-app-announced/">recently-launched Sports app</a> for the iPhone was updated today ahead of the NBA and NHL playoffs, which both begin this weekend.<br/>

Apple says fans will be able to "follow every matchup with added details on each series and more," but we have not noticed any immediate changes in the app after updating to the new version. The first NBA and NHL playoff series begin on Saturday, April 20, so the extra details will presumably become visible then. Some info like playoff matchups and conference standings was already available in the previous version of the app.<br/>
<br/>
Released in February, the Apple Sports app shows scores, schedules, stats, and more for a variety of leagues, such as the NBA, NHL, MLB, MLS, and Premier League. The app also displays real-time play-by-play information for ongoing games.<br/>
<br/>
Apple Sports is available for free <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/apple-sports/id6446788829">on the App Store</a>.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-sports/">Apple Sports</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/15/apple-sports-app-updated-for-nba-and-nhl-playoffs/">Apple Sports App Updated for NBA and NHL Playoffs</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-sports-app-updated-for-nba-and-nhl-playoffs.2424229/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>
