		<description><![CDATA[Apple today <a href="https://developer.apple.com/safari/download/">released a new update</a> for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/safari-technology-preview/">Safari Technology Preview</a>, the experimental browser Apple <a href="http://www.macrumors.com/2016/03/30/apple-safari-technology-preview-browser/">first introduced</a> in March 2016. Apple designed the &zwnj;Safari Technology Preview&zwnj; to test features that may be introduced into future release versions of Safari.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-785724" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/02/Safari-Technology-Preview-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2368" height="1332" /><br/>
&zwnj;Safari Technology Preview&zwnj; 184 includes fixes and updates for Accessibility, CSS, HTMK, JavaScript, Media, Web Animations, Web API, Web Assembly, Web Inspector, and WebGL.<br/>
<br/>
The current &zwnj;Safari Technology Preview&zwnj; release is compatible with machines running macOS Ventura and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sonoma/">macOS Sonoma</a>, the latest version of macOS that Apple released in September 2023.<br/>
<br/>
The &zwnj;Safari Technology Preview&zwnj; update is available through the Software Update mechanism in System Preferences or System Settings to anyone who has <a href="https://developer.apple.com/safari/download/">downloaded the browser</a>. Full release notes for the update are available <a href="https://developer.apple.com/safari/technology-preview/release-notes/">on the Safari Technology Preview website</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Apple's aim with &zwnj;Safari Technology Preview&zwnj; is to gather feedback from developers and users on its browser development process. &zwnj;Safari Technology Preview&zwnj; can run side-by-side with the existing Safari browser and while designed for developers, it does not require a developer account to download.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/safari-technology-preview/">Safari Technology Preview</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/07/apple-releases-safari-technology-preview-184/">Apple Releases Safari Technology Preview 184 With Bug Fixes and Performance Improvements</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-releases-safari-technology-preview-184-with-bug-fixes-and-performance-improvements.2413117/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Former Apple director of corporate law Gene Levoff was today sentenced to a fine and four years of probation for insider trading, according to <em><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-12-07/apple-s-ex-corporate-law-chief-avoids-prison-for-insider-trading">Bloomberg</a></em>. Levoff was facing up to two years in prison, but he will avoid time behind bars.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/10/apple-logo-cash-feature.jpg" alt="" width="1430" height="805" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-767473" /><br/>
Levoff's role at Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2019/02/13/apples-gene-levoff-charged-insider-trading/">was supposed to include</a> ensuring that Apple employees were compliant with the company's insider trading policies, including enforcement of "blackout periods" around Apple's earnings reports, but he ended up committing the crime he was meant to police.<br/>
<br/>
Due to his position, Levoff was given access to Apple's earnings results before they were made available to the public, and he used the information to buy Apple shares prior to better-than-expected results, and sell shares when there were weaker-than-expected earnings. Levoff earned around &#36;277,000, and avoided losses of around &#36;377,000 before he was fired by Apple in 2018.<br/>
<br/>
Levoff last June <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/07/01/former-apple-lawyer-pleads-guilty-insider-trading/">pleaded guilty</a> to six counts of securities fraud for insider trading, and his sentencing took place today. In addition to four years probation, Levoff will pay approximately &#36;604,000.<br/>
<br/>
Federal prosecutors argued that Levoff should be sent to prison for insider trading to deter other corporate executives from committing a similar crime, but the judge overseeing the case said that he didn't feel it was necessary because Levoff lost his job and will no longer be able to practice law.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/07/former-apple-lawyer-insider-trading-no-prison/">Former Apple Lawyer Gene Levoff Avoids Prison After Insider Trading Conviction</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/former-apple-lawyer-gene-levoff-avoids-prison-after-insider-trading-conviction.2413116/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a> lineup came out in September, and while most reviews are done shortly after a new device launches, we like to follow up with a longer term review that gives us an opportunity to provide a deeper dive into what it's like using these phones on a day to day basis for months.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe width="560" height=315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/drJNofd3gtk" title="iPhone 15 Pro Max Long Term Review: Still Worth It 2 Months Later?" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe><em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/macrumors?sub_confirmation=1">Subscribe to the MacRumors YouTube channel</a> for more videos.</em></div><br/>
<em>MacRumors</em> videographer Dan Barbera has been using his <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a> Max without a case to test durability, and the titanium frame has been holding up much better than stainless steel. Even after some minor drops, there are no scratches or scuffs to speak of.<br/>
<br/>
There were reports of overheating early on with the &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; models, but Apple has addressed this in software updates. The &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; stays cool to the touch for the most part, even when playing games. It can heat up when charging at random times, but it's not a consistent issue.<br/>
<br/>
Battery life is about on par with the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-14/">iPhone 14</a> Pro Max battery life, and there doesn't seem to be much of an improvement.<br/>
<br/>
With the &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; models, Apple added an Action Button, and , well, it's not getting much use. It's hard to get in the habit of using a new button for things that we've done for years using other workflows.<br/>
<br/>
As for the camera, the best feature by far is the automatic portrait mode that lets you adjust focus after an image is captured without having to turn on Portrait mode. It's fun to use, and you can tap on each subject in the photo to change the focus from the foreground to the background. The 5x Telephoto lens is also a useful addition.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple <a href="https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=ik9z4ll6">today announced</a> that starting in January 2024, all Apple Developer Program memberships will include 25 compute hours of Xcode Cloud at no additional cost on top of the Developer membership fee.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/06/Xcode-Cloud-icon.jpeg" alt="" width="1200" height="630" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-848670" /><br/>
<a href="https://developer.apple.com/xcode-cloud/get-started/">Xcode Cloud</a> is designed to provide cloud-based tools to developers for building apps, running automated tests, providing apps to testers, and managing user feedback. It was introduced in 2021, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/06/07/xcode-cloud-now-available-to-all-apple-developers/">made available to all developers</a> in June 2022.<br/>
<br/>
Since launch, Apple has given developers access to 25 hours of Xcode Cloud per month at no cost, but that was scheduled to end this month. Apple has now decided to continue offering the free compute hours as part of its Developer Program membership.<br/>
<blockquote>We're pleased to announce that as of January 2024, all Apple Developer Program memberships will include 25 compute hours per month on Xcode Cloud as a standard, with no additional cost. If you're already subscribed to Xcode Cloud for free, no additional action is required on your part. And if you haven't tried Xcode Cloud yet, now is the perfect time to start building your app for free in just a few minutes.</blockquote><br/>
Apple initially planned to charge &#36;15 per month for 25 hours, but that tier will be free. 100 compute hours is priced at &#36;50 per month, 250 hours is priced at &#36;100 per month, and 1,000 hours is priced at &#36;400 per month.<br/>
<br/>
Each compute hour is an hour of time used to execute a task in the cloud, such as building an app or running tests. Compute hour usage is tracked through <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a> connect and the Apple Developer app.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/xcode/">Xcode</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/07/apple-developer-program-xcode-cloud/">Developers Will Soon Get 25 Monthly Hours of Xcode Cloud With Apple Developer Program</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/developers-will-soon-get-25-monthly-hours-of-xcode-cloud-with-apple-developer-program.2413101/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[There is an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-pay/">Apple Pay</a> and Wallet outage that is causing some users to experience issues with &zwnj;Apple Pay&zwnj; web payments and in-app payments using &zwnj;Apple Pay&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/01/apple-pay-mac-website.jpg" alt="Mac Apple Pay" width="1694" height="1022" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-726024" /><br/>
According to <a href="https://www.apple.com/support/systemstatus/">Apple's System Status page</a>, the outage began at 5:04 a.m. Eastern Time, and it is ongoing. Apple says that only "some users" are having problems, but there are multiple tweets about the payment issues.<br/>
<br/>
Note that this is not affecting payments that are made using &zwnj;Apple Pay&zwnj; in retail stores, with those &zwnj;Apple Pay&zwnj; purchases working fine. Apple does say that some users could experience issues managing, purchasing, or topping-up transit cards. <br/>
<br/>
There is no word yet on when the &zwnj;Apple Pay&zwnj; outage might be resolved, but we'll update this article when Apple says that the &zwnj;Apple Pay&zwnj; issues have been addressed.<br/>
<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Starting with the upcoming iOS 17.2 software update, there is a new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/ios-share-contact-details-with-namedrop/">NameDrop</a>-like feature that allows an iPhone user to quickly share boarding passes, movie tickets, and other Wallet app passes with another iPhone user.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/12/AirDrop-1Pass-Feature-1.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-925564" /><br/>
To use the feature, open the Wallet app and tap on the pass that you want to share. Then, hold your iPhone near the top of another iPhone, and a "Share" button will appear below the pass on your iPhone. Finally, tap on the "Share" button to send the pass to the other iPhone via AirDrop. Both iPhones must be updated to iOS 17.2.<br/>
<br/>
While it is already possible to share many Wallet app passes via AirDrop, Messages, Mail, and more through the iOS sharing menu, this new feature aims to provide a quicker and more convenient method. It works similarly to NameDrop, an iOS 17 feature that lets users quickly share contact information by bringing two iPhones together.<br/>
<br/>
The feature is mentioned in the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/06/ios-17-2-release-notes/">iOS 17.2 release notes</a>: "AirDrop improvements including expanded contact sharing options and the ability to share boarding passes, movie tickets, and other eligible passes by bringing two iPhones together." The software update is in the final stage of beta testing and should be released next week.<br/>
<br/>
iOS 17.2 includes <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ios-17-2-beta-features/">many other new features and changes</a>, including a Journal app, spatial video recording on iPhone 15 Pro models, several improvements to the Messages and Weather apps, a Favorite Songs playlist in Apple Music, and more.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-17/">iPadOS 17</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-17.241">iOS 17</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-17.242">iPadOS 17</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/07/ios-17-namedrop-like-wallet-passes-sharing/">iOS 17.2 Adds NameDrop-Like Feature for Sharing Boarding Passes, Movie Tickets, and More</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-17-2-adds-namedrop-like-feature-for-sharing-boarding-passes-movie-tickets-and-more.2413092/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2023/12/report-2-point-6-billion-records-compromised-by-data-breaches-in-past-two-years/">shared a study</a> conducted by MIT professor Dr. Stuart Madnick that found 2.6 billion personal records were compromised by data breaches in the past two years. The study was commissioned by Apple, but the cover page says that the "conclusions and opinions expressed are exclusively those of the author."<br/>
<br/>

Apple provided an overview of the study in its press release:<blockquote>The report illustrates that the historic threats to user data that saw the number of data breaches nearly triple between 2013 and 2022, compromising 2.6 billion records over the course of two years, are only getting worse in 2023. In the U.S. alone, there were nearly 20 percent more breaches in just the first nine months of 2023 than in any prior year. The target for cybercriminals was very clear, with a 2023 survey finding that over 80 percent of breaches involved data stored in the cloud. This is after attacks targeting cloud infrastructure nearly doubled from 2021 to 2022.</blockquote>Additional details can be found in the study: "<a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/pdfs/The-Continued-Threat-to-Personal-Data-Key-Factors-Behind-the-2023-Increase.pdf">The Continued Threat to Personal Data: Key Factors Behind the 2023 Increase.</a>"<br/>
<br/>
Apple says the study's findings emphasize the need for end-to-end encryption, which iCloud already provides for 14 data categories by default. For users looking for additional protection, Apple offers an optional feature called <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/01/18/ios-16-3-advanced-data-protection-global/">Advanced Data Protection</a>, which increases the number of iCloud data categories covered by end-to-end encryption to 23, including iCloud Backup, Notes, Photos, Voice Memos, and more.<ul><li><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/enable-advanced-data-protection-icloud/">How to Enable End-to-End Encryption for iCloud Backups</a></li></ul>"Bad actors continue to pour enormous amounts of time and resources into finding more creative and effective ways to steal consumer data, and we won't rest in our efforts to stop them," said Apple's software engineering chief Craig Federighi.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-security/">Apple Security</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/advanced-data-protection/">Advanced Data Protection</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/07/apple-promotes-advanced-data-protection/">Apple Promotes iCloud&#039;s Advanced End-to-End Encryption Feature as Data Breaches Increase</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-promotes-iclouds-advanced-end-to-end-encryption-feature-as-data-breaches-increase.2413079/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/10/ipad-air-touch-id-feature.jpg" alt="" width="1900" height="1069" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-762557" /><br/>
Steve Hotelling currently works as a vice president reporting to senior vice president of hardware technologies Johny Srouji. During his tenure, Hotelling significantly contributed to the development of some of Apple's most innovative and complex technologies used in the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>, Apple Watch, and Vision Pro headset. Hotelling's name appears on hundreds of patents, including filings related to multitouch displays and &zwnj;Touch ID&zwnj;. <br/>
<br/>
Hotelling led the company's camera engineering team and was involved in the development of custom sensors. His work oversaw the development of the depth-sensing technologies crucial for augmented reality experiences and components fundamental to haptic feedback and ProMotion displays.<br/>
<br/>
Hotelling has also been a prominent representative for Apple in numerous legal trials throughout his two decades with the company. He was a key figure in a patent case against Samsung in the last decade and recently served as a crucial witness in a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/masimo/">trial involving Masimo</a>, which sued Apple over patents <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2020/09/29/masimo-apple-delaying-lawsuit-apple-watch/">related to health sensors</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Despite the significance of his departure, Apple has not yet shared an official statement regarding Hotelling's retirement. His responsibilities are apparently being distributed among several of Srouji's direct reports, with Alan Gilchrist taking over the management of the camera and depth sensor teams, and Wei Chen taking over display technologies. Apple's hardware technologies group continues work on a custom 5G cellular modem, new wireless chips, microLED displays, and a non-invasive blood sugar sensor.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/bloomberg-com/">Bloomberg</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/07/executive-behind-hardware-technologies-retires/">Apple Executive Behind Breakthrough Hardware Technologies Retires</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-executive-behind-breakthrough-hardware-technologies-retires.2413066/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<title>Spotify on iOS to Bring Back In-App Purchases, Beta Code Suggests [Updated]</title>

		<description><![CDATA[Spotify appears to be bringing in-app payments back to its iOS app, based on code strings unearthed in the latest beta.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/08/General-Spotify-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1407" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-810756" /><br/>
<em>MacRumors</em> contributor Aaron Perris discovered the new code references to an in-app payment system, including an IAP checkout screen and purchase retry panels for failed purchases.<br/>
<br/>
It's not clear what the IAP references relate to, but the fact that they are included is curious in itself. Spotify has not allowed customers to sign up for a Spotify Premium subscription through the ‌<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a>‌ for the last seven years.<br/>
<br/>
There is no mechanism for subscribing to Spotify through the Spotify app, as Spotify has restricted signups to its website in order to avoid paying Apple's fees. "You can't upgrade to Premium in the app," reads Spotify's "Premium" section in its iOS app. "We know, it's not ideal." <br/>
<br/>
Over the years, Apple and Spotify have had a long running dispute over Apple's &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; policies, with multiple public conflicts over app and subscription fees and app rejections due to Spotify's attempts to skirt the up to 30 percent cut that Apple takes from purchases.<br/>
<br/>
In comments made in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/11/30/facebook-spotify-app-store-criticism/">November 2022</a>, Spotify CEO Daniel Ek accused Apple of giving developers "the illusion of control," and said that the ‌&zwnj;App Store&zwnj;‌ is a "threat to the future of the internet" that denies consumers choice.<br/>
<br/>
Ek also clashed with Apple over Spotify's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/10/25/spotify-audio-book-app-update-rejected-apple/">audiobooks feature</a>. Apple in 2022 rejected Spotify's audiobook update several times and ultimately did not allow Spotify to direct users to purchase audiobooks through an in-app email signup button.<br/>
<br/>
Things are different over on Android devices. Since November 2020, Spotify has been be able to bill Android users directly in the Google Play version of Spotify without needing to go through the Google Play billing system. <br/>
<br/>
This is because Spotify uses Google's "<a href="https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/12570971">User Choice Billing</a>," a feature that allows Android users to make purchases using the payment option they prefer. User Choice Billing is essentially an alternative billing option for in-app purchases, and it comes with a reduced fee.<br/>
<br/>
Apple offers no alternative billing from the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj;. There are two exceptions, however, including South Korea and the Netherlands. Regulators in these countries have forced Apple to allow some apps to use third-party payment providers.<br/>
<br/>
With Google adopting options for alternative billing and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/04/11/apple-faces-further-charges-in-eu-antitrust-case/">continued regulatory pressure</a>, it is possible that Apple will also fold and expand the Dutch and South Korea processes to other countries and app types. However, whether the IAP references in Spotify's code relate to such a plan is unknown. Another possibility is that Spotify is preparing to increase the price of its subscriptions to account for Apple's commission on in-app purchases. <br/>
<br/>
Earlier this week, Spotify announced it will lay off about 1,500 employees, or 17% of its workforce, as the company seeks to downsize after a period of aggressive spending on podcasts and audiobooks. The latest round of cuts is the third in a year, with Spotify still facing annual financial losses amounting to hundreds of millions of dollars.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Meta is rolling out end-to-end encryption for personal messages and calls on Messenger and Facebook, finally delivering on a pledge it committed to some time ago.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/12/encrypted-messenger.jpg" alt="" width="1536" height="864" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-925500" /><br/>
Messenger encryption originally arrived in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2016/10/05/facebook-encrypion-messenger/">2016</a> in the form of "secret conversations," and plans to extend the platform's cryptographic features have been floated ever since. <br/>
<br/>
<a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2023/12/default-end-to-end-encryption-on-messenger/">According to Loredana Crisan</a>, Head of Messenger, Meta is only now turning on end-to-end encryption for all messages and calls between two people after years spent "rebuilding Messenger features from the ground up."<br/>
<blockquote>Since 2016, Messenger has had the option for people to turn on end-to-end encryption, but we're now changing private chats and calls across Messenger to be end-to-end encrypted by default. This has taken years to deliver because we've taken our time to get this right. Our engineers, cryptographers, designers, policy experts and product managers have worked tirelessly to rebuild Messenger features from the ground up. We've introduced new privacy, safety and control features along the way like delivery controls that let people choose who can message them, as well as app lock, alongside existing safety features like report, block and message requests. We worked closely with outside experts, academics, advocates and governments to identify risks and build mitigations to ensure that privacy and safety go hand-in-hand.</blockquote>The extra layer of security provided by end-to-end encryption means that the content of messages and calls are protected from the moment they leave the sender's device to the moment they reach the receiver's device. In other words, nobody, including Meta, can see what is sent or said, unless the message is reported.<br/>
<br/>
End-to-end encrypted conversations also offer additional functionality including the ability to edit messages, higher media quality, and disappearing messages.<br/>
<br/>
Meta notes that end-to-end encryption won't prevent users from using features like themes and custom reactions, but "it may take some time for Messenger chats to be updated with default end-to-end encryption."<br/>
<br/>
As things stand, end-to-end encryption for group Messenger chats remains opt-in, and Meta previously said that Instagram messages will be encrypted "shortly after" the rollout of default encryption for Messenger chats.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/facebook-messenger/">Facebook Messenger</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/encryption/">Encryption</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/privacy/">Privacy</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/07/facebook-messenger-end-to-end-encryption/">Facebook Messenger Rolls Out End-to-End Encryption by Default</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/facebook-messenger-rolls-out-end-to-end-encryption-by-default.2413057/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple has updated its <a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/law-enforcement-guidelines-us.pdf">Legal Process Guidelines</a> to reflect the company's legal obligation to comply with law enforcement requests for Apple ID information associated with its push notification service. The change follows yesterday's revelation that governments are actively using smartphone notification data as a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/06/apple-governments-surveil-push-notifications/">user surveillance tool</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/01/appleprivacyad-cleaned.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="872" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-833885" /><br/>
In the section titled "Information Available from Apple," Apple has appended an alphabetical list with the subsection "AA. Apple Push Notification Service (APNs)," which reads:<br/>
<blockquote>When users allow an application they have installed to receive push notifications, an Apple Push Notification Service (APNs) token is generated and registered to that developer and device. Some apps may have multiple APNs tokens for one account on one device to differentiate between messages and multi-media.<br/>
<br/>
The Apple ID associated with a registered APNs token may be obtained with a subpoena or greater legal process.</blockquote>Apple and Google have been forced by governments at home and abroad to provide users' data from notifications they get on their devices, US Senator Ron Wyden revealed on Wednesday in a letter to the Justice Department, drawing attention to a new smartphone privacy concern.<br/>
<br/>
The Justice Department declined to comment on the letter, but Apple and Google confirmed that they have been subject to the requests. The companies explained that they had been prohibited from sharing information about how governments monitored push notifications until Wyden's letter had been made public and given them the legal opening they needed.<br/>
<br/>
With push notifications enabled, Apple and Google create a small bit of data, known as a token, that links the user's device to the account information they've given the companies, such as their name and email address.<br/>
<br/>
A <em>Reuters</em> source familiar with the matter confirmed that both foreign and U.S. government agencies have been asking Apple and Google for user information related to push notifications. The data is said to have been used to attempt to tie anonymous users of messaging apps to specific Apple or Google accounts.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/12/06/push-notifications-surveillance-apple-google/"><em>The Washington Post</em></a> said on Wednesday it had found more than two dozen search warrant applications and other documents in court records related to federal requests for push notification data. Though many were redacted, nine of the documents pertained to the federal hunt for U.S. Capitol rioters on January 6, 2021.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-privacy/">Apple Privacy</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/07/apple-updates-law-enforcement-guidelines/">Apple Adds Push Notification Data to Law Enforcement Guidelines</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-adds-push-notification-data-to-law-enforcement-guidelines.2413049/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple plans a significant upgrade to the iPhone 16 microphone to improve the new AI-enhanced Siri experience, according to Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/iPhone-16-Side-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="3532" height="1986" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-913689" /><br/>
Writing in his <a href="https://medium.com/@mingchikuo/瑞聲科技與歌爾股份為ai-iphone的領先受益者-aac-and-goertek-are-ai-iphones-leading-beneficiaries-1ec29ee45e42">latest Medium post</a>, Kuo says that "strengthening Siri's hardware and software features and specifications is the key to promoting AI-generated content," adding that Apple's generative AI ambitions and integration of large-language models (LLMs) into Siri will heavily rely on improved voice input processing. <br/>
<br/>
To that end, Apple is preparing a major microphone upgrade for the iPhone 16, with better signal-to-noise ratio a key specification that will "improve the Siri experience significantly," says Kuo. The new microphone will also have better water resistance. <br/>
<br/>
The upgrade corroborates other reports suggesting Apple plans to make enhanced Siri features a key selling point of the iPhone 16. New Siri features <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/22/apple-generative-ai-features-and-smarter-siri/">powered by LLMs</a> are expected in iOS 18, and Kuo's report notes that Apple reorganized its Siri team in the third quarter of this year to integrate generative AI and LLMs. However, Kuo's predictions also add weight to rumors that additional on-device AI features could remain <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/09/iphone-16-exclusive-ai-features-ios-18/">exclusive to the iPhone 16 models</a>.<br/>
<br/>
According to the analyst's latest survey, AAC and Goertek are the microphone suppliers for the iPhone 16, and will benefit equally from the specification upgrade. "The ASP of microphones for each iPhone 16 will be at least 100–150% higher than that of the iPhone 15," says Kuo. "As a result, AAC's and Goertek's revenues and earnings are expected to benefit significantly from this upgrade."<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/">iPhone 16 Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/">Ming-Chi Kuo</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/07/apple-iphone-16-microphone-upgrade-siri-ai/">Kuo: Apple Upgrading iPhone 16 Microphone to Boost Siri AI Experience</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/kuo-apple-upgrading-iphone-16-microphone-to-boost-siri-ai-experience.2413044/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Next-generation Qi2 chargers from Anker will charge the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-13/">iPhone 13</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-14/">iPhone 14</a>, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a> at faster 15W speeds, Anker told <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/6/23990215/anker-qi2-15w-wireless-charging-iphone-13-14-15">The Verge</a></em>. Current Qi-based chargers from companies like Anker are limited to 7.5W when used with Apple's iPhones, while <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe-battery-pack/">MagSafe</a> chargers support 15W charging.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-911511" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/magsafe-blue-2.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" /><br/>
While Qi2 has the same magnetic alignment that &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; offers, Apple has not provided details on the Qi2 charging speeds that the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> will support. During the introduction of the &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a> models, Apple said they support Qi2, but the technical specifications page for the devices says that Qi wireless charging is limited to 7.5W.<br/>
<blockquote>Anker spokesperson Mary Woodbury confirmed in an email to The Verge that, unlike older Qi products that were limited to half-speed 7.5W charging with iPhones, the new MagGo products can support 15W charging, the same maximum rate you get with Apple's MagSafe-branded gear.</blockquote><br/>
Apple has not confirmed 15W charging speeds with Qi2, nor have other manufacturers working on Qi2 provided specific charging speeds, but if Anker's upcoming Qi2 chargers work at 15W, other wireless chargers will likely have the same maximum speed.<br/>
<br/>
The &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; models have had Qi2 support since they launched, and with the iOS 17.2 that's coming soon, Apple is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/05/ios-17-2-qi-iphone-13-14-models/">adding Qi2 support</a> to the &zwnj;iPhone 13&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPhone 14&zwnj; models.<br/>
<br/>
If Qi2 does support actual 15W charging speeds on the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; similar to &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj;, the certification could help clear up some confusing with existing magnetic wireless chargers. Current Qi-based chargers that have magnets are still limited to 7.5W charging, but manufacturers often like to say that they support up to 15W because other non-iPhone smartphones are able to charge at those speeds.<br/>
<br/>
The first Qi2 chargers are expected in late 2023, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/31/belkin-qi2-wireless-chargers/">brands like Belkin</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/01/mophie-unveils-qi2-accessories/">Mophie</a>, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/31/anker-usb-c-nano-accessories/">Anker</a> have already announced new Qi2 products.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/anker/">Anker</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/qi2/">Qi2</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/06/anker-qi2-15w-charging/">Anker&#039;s Qi2 Chargers Will Charge iPhones at 15W</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ankers-qi2-chargers-will-charge-iphones-at-15w.2413020/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Disney <a href="https://thewaltdisneycompany.com/hulu-on-disney-beta-launch/">today announced</a> that customers who subscribe to its Hulu and Disney+ bundle can access Hulu content through a new "Hulu on Disney+" beta that aims to combine the two apps into a single app.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe title="Hulu on Disney+ Beta Now Streaming" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AgHZ7EeNaSg" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" data-thumb-size="hqdefault"></iframe></div><br/>
The beta is available to bundle subscribers as of now, with Disney planning to test the combined service before it rolls out in the spring. Bundle subscribers will see a Hulu title appear alongside Disney, Pixar, Marvel, Star Wars, and National Geographic tiles in the Disney+ interface.<br/>
<br/>
Clicking on the Hulu tile brings Bundle subscribers to the new Hulu Hub that has all of the Hulu content without the need to switch over to the Hulu app. The two-step launch process is meant to keep Hulu content separate from Disney+ content for parents who do not want the more adult content from Hulu accessible to children.<br/>
<br/>
Disney said that it wants to better understand consumer needs and wants for Hulu on Disney+ before it launches in March 2024. Disney does not plan to replace either the standalone Hulu or Disney+ subscriptions, both will continue be available.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/disney/">Disney</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/hulu/">Hulu</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/06/hulu-disney-plus-merged-beta/">Hulu on Disney+ Beta Launches for Bundle Subscribers</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/hulu-on-disney-beta-launches-for-bundle-subscribers.2413014/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Recently, <em>MacRumors</em> has received details on the battery currently being tested on the upcoming fourth-generation <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-se/">iPhone SE</a>, and the information corroborates previous findings in relation to the device.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/02/iphone-se-4-modified-flag-edges.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-886982" /><br/>
The &zwnj;iPhone SE&zwnj; 4, known by its device identifier D59, is expected to use the exact same battery found in the base model <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-14/">iPhone 14</a>. Partially assembled prototypes of the next &zwnj;iPhone SE&zwnj; have been seen equipped with lithium-ion batteries bearing the model number A2863, which Apple has already used in the past. Internal design documentation also corroborates this change. The battery itself features an improved capacity compared to the current &zwnj;iPhone SE&zwnj; 3:<br/>
<br/>
<ul><li><strong>iPhone SE 3</strong>: 2018 mAh</li><br/>
<li><strong>iPhone 14 (A2863)</strong>: 3279 mAh</li></ul><br/>
<br/>
Compared to the battery used in the third-generation &zwnj;iPhone SE&zwnj;, the A2863 battery brings with it an increase of over 1250 mAh, potentially resulting in longer battery life for the end-user. <br/>
<br/>
As with most of the &zwnj;iPhone SE&zwnj; 4, Apple has chosen the A2863 battery as a carry-over from the &zwnj;iPhone 14&zwnj;. While Apple has allegedly developed entirely <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/20/iphone-16-pro-leak-reveals-redesigned-battery/">new batteries for the iPhone 16 Pro with enhanced thermal capabilities</a>, the fourth-generation &zwnj;iPhone SE&zwnj; will continue to use existing parts as a cost-cutting measure.<br/>
<br/>
Developing new components for the &zwnj;iPhone SE&zwnj; 4 would incur additional research and development costs for Apple, so the use of an existing battery would help maintain the relative affordability of the device compared to other <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> models Apple offers. This also lines up with Apple's previous decisions in regard to the &zwnj;iPhone SE&zwnj;, as the second-generation &zwnj;iPhone SE&zwnj; used the exact same battery as the older &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 8.<br/>
<br/>
In terms of other relevant upgrades, the fourth-generation &zwnj;iPhone SE&zwnj; will feature a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/09/iphone-se-4-iphone-14-chassis/">new iPhone 14-based design</a>, and will be equipped with an Action button and USB-C port, which we've covered extensively in our <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/27/iphone-se-4-details/">previous reports</a>.<br/>
<br/>
It is important to remember, though, that the information provided here is pre-production information. While prototype units of the &zwnj;iPhone SE&zwnj; 4 use the A2863 battery, Apple's plans could change as the device is still far from release. <br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Nanoleaf is known for its smart lighting panels, but this year the company launched a set of <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FNanoleaf-Essentials-Lightstrip-Smarter-Built%2Fdp%2FB0CKWLBQG5">&#36;99 Smart Holiday String Lights</a> that are compatible with Matter and thus <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/homekit/">HomeKit</a>. Matter devices connect to &zwnj;HomeKit&zwnj; in the same way that traditional &zwnj;HomeKit&zwnj; devices do, but you will need a Matter-compatible smart home hub. For the &zwnj;HomeKit&zwnj; ecosystem, this is anything that serves as a &zwnj;HomeKit&zwnj; "home hub," such as an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a> or <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod/">HomePod</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/nanoleaf-holiday-lights-1.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-915782" /><br/>
Priced at &#36;99 for a 20-meter (65 ft) light strand with 250 LEDs, the Nanoleaf Holiday String Lights are priced competitively. They're more affordable than similar smart string lights from Philips Hue or Twinkly, though Twinkly is often around the same price if you find them on sale. A 65-foot light strand is about the right size for a 7-foot tree, though it won't be the most dense lighting. For a more even look, two light strands of this length are required for most trees around that size.<br/>
<br/>
There are two connected 10-meter strands with 125 LEDs each (which is also how Twinkly works). According to Nanoleaf, the dual strand design is ideal for use with trees. Starting at the middle of the tree, one strand can be wrapped up toward the top, while the second can be wrapped down toward the bottom. It is not possible to connect two sets of the string lights together, however, and each needs its own power supply if you're using multiples.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/12/nanoleaf-string-lights-design.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1124" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-925456" /><br/>
The Nanoleaf lights look a lot like the Twinkly lights in terms of design, with a flat-topped LED that has rounded sides. There's about three inches of space between each LED, and the cord is black with no other color options available. Black stands out more than green on a Christmas tree, so it would be nice to have a green cord option. Twinkly makes some clear cord string lights, and I think that's a good way to go because it's able to better blend into the surroundings.<br/>
<br/>
Unlike Twinkly lights, you cannot control each individual LED, and instead these are set to different color palettes and patterns like the Hue String Lights. The Nanoleaf lights actually feel like a cross between Hue and Twinkly because they're not quite as customizable as Twinkly, but offer more patterns than Hue. 16 million colors are supported on the Nanoleaf lights, as well as multiple shades of white. The Nanoleaf app has pre-designed color palettes that you can choose in addition to the tools to create your own.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/12/nanoleaf-lights-multicolored.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-925457" /><br/>
There's also a community feature with Nanoleaf so you can download lighting animations and color palettes created by others, giving you a lot of options for design without having to put in a lot of work. Nanoleaf's community feature has long been one of my favorite Nanoleaf features because it provides so many options with just a quick search.<br/>
<br/>
The Nanoleaf String Light's colors are vibrant and bright and remind me a lot of Twinkly in terms of saturation and lighting patterns. Compared to Hue, Nanoleaf is brighter, and I don't feel that Nanoleaf's lights do gradients quite as well. The Hue holiday lights have the best color fades and pre-made patterns, and Nanoleaf can't compete there.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/12/nanoleaf-lights-blue.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-925458" /><br/>
The best way to control the lights is through the Nanoleaf app, but once you establish lighting scenes, you can activate them through the Home app or <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a> voice commands. The Home app can be used to control the Nanoleaf String Lights directly, but it's not really set up for individual LED control so it only works for turning the entire strand a single shade.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/12/nanoleaf-string-lights-in-pink.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1500" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-925462" /><br/>
While these do connect to &zwnj;HomeKit&zwnj; (and other Matter-enabled smart home platforms), you can use them with the Nanoleaf app alone over Wi-Fi or Bluetooth. With the included controller, the lights can be synced to music that is playing. There is a physical button on the light strand for turning them on and off and cycling through white shades, colors, and Scenes that have been set up.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/12/nanoleaf-lights-pink.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-925459" /><br/>
According to Nanoleaf, the lights are 250 lumens, and the strand draws 18W of power. With the light strand on for 12 hours a day and an electricity cost of 13 cents per kilowatt hour, it would cost around &#36;10 a year to run these lights.<br/>
<br/>
These have an IP44 water/dust resistance rating, so they can be used indoors or outdoors and will be able to stand up to rain, but may not be able to hold up in particularly harsh weather like a downpour. Nanoleaf says they can be used in temperatures ranging from 5 degrees to 104 degrees.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/12/nanoleaf-lights-white.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-925460" /><br/>
As a &zwnj;HomeKit&zwnj; device, automations and schedules can be used to turn the lights on and off at set times or to change patterns based on sensors, times, or with geofencing.<br/>
<br/>
During my time testing the lights, I did not run into issues with connectivity. Matter can be a little finicky right now, which is something to be aware of. In the past I have run into connectivity issues with non-Matter Nanoleaf products, but most of the time the solution has been removing and re-adding to &zwnj;HomeKit&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/12/nanoleaf-lights-green.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-925461" /><br/>
Nanoleaf's Matter-enabled String Lights are the most affordable string lights that connect to &zwnj;HomeKit&zwnj; that I'm aware of. At &#36;99, they're cheaper than the Hue or Twinkly versions that have the same 250-LED count.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Bottom Line</h2><br/>
Nanoleaf's Matter-enabled Smart Holiday String Lights are a good deal comparatively, and they offer a lot of fun options for holiday decorating. These are quite not as customizable as Twinkly lights (which you can paint on using the app), but Nanoleaf has a better selection of pre-made scenes and color palettes to choose from.<br/>
<br/>
The Nanoleaf app is a lot more user friendly and intuitive than the Twinkly app, which is my least favorite smart home product app. If you're someone who wants to hop onto an app, find a set of cool colors, and be done in about 30 seconds, Nanoleaf's string lights will facilitate that.<br/>
<br/>
You can use these in tandem with other &zwnj;HomeKit&zwnj; products, but you won't have the integrations you'll have with say, the Hue String Lights and other Hue lights. If you're in the Hue ecosystem, I still think the Hue String Lights are the best holiday lights to get, but if you just need a general HomeKit-connected string light, Nanoleaf is a good option.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Nanoleaf Downlights</h2><br/>
Though not related to the String Lights, Nanoleaf also came out with some <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FNanoleaf-Essentials-Lightstrip-Smarter-Built%2Fdp%2FB0CKWLBQG5">Matter 4-inch downlights</a>, a first for the company. I was able to test these out, and I think if you're looking for a smart downlight replacement that does not require a hub, these are a good bet.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/nanoleaf-downlight.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-916707" /><br/>
I prefer my Hue downlights just because I am in the Hue ecosystem, but the Nanoleaf ones work just as well in terms of color options and brightness. Nanoleaf does not have 6-inch versions at this time, so that will be a barrier to those who have larger downlights or a mix.<br/>
<br/>
I have had some disconnects with these lights, but I don't want to blame Nanoleaf for that because I think it is a &zwnj;HomeKit&zwnj; Matter issue where there are still bugs for Apple to work out.<br/>
<br/>
These are <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FNanoleaf-Essentials-Lightstrip-Smarter-Built%2Fdp%2FB0CKWLBQG5">only &#36;30 each</a>, which makes them half as expensive as the Hue version. If you're willing to do some troubleshooting every once in awhile until &zwnj;HomeKit&zwnj; is shored up for Matter, Nanoleaf's downlights are worth trying.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>How to Buy</h2><br/>
The Nanoleaf String Lights can be <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FNanoleaf-Essentials-Lightstrip-Smarter-Built%2Fdp%2FB0CKWLBQG5">purchased from Amazon</a> or from the <a href="https://nanoleaf.me/en-US/products/seasonal/holiday-string-lights/">Nanoleaf website</a> for &#36;100.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple is doing away with the redundant iTunes Movies and iTunes TV Show apps on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a> starting with the tvOS 17.2 update. As noted by <em><a href="https://9to5mac.com/2023/12/06/itunes-movies-and-tv-shows-app-discontinued-apple-tv/">9to5Mac</a></em>, in the release candidate version of tvOS 17.2, opening up those apps redirects users to the &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj; app.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/12/apple-tv-itunes-purchases.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-925449" /><br/>
The &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj; app supports both movie and TV show purchases, making the old iTunes Movies and iTunes TV Shows apps unnecessary and also confusing to some &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj; users.<br/>
<br/>
"iTunes Movies and Your Purchases Have Moved," reads the text in the iOS 17.2 release candidate. "You can buy or rent movies and find your purchases in the &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj; app."<br/>
<br/>
<em>Bloomberg</em>'s <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a> <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/24/apple-tv-app-revamp/">in October said</a> that Apple planned to remove the standalone &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj; apps available for renting and purchasing TV shows and movies, and he also said that the TV show and movie sections would be removed from the iTunes Store app on iPhones and iPads.<br/>
<br/>
While Apple has indeed started the process of eliminating its iTunes TV Shows and iTunes Movies apps on &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj;, the apps do still exist in the RC in order to provide customers with instructions on where to find their content going forward. Apple will likely remove the apps entirely in the near future.<br/>
<br/>
On the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> and the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>, the iTunes Store app continues to offer TV show and movie purchases right alongside the &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj; app, but the option to purchase that content may soon be removed from the iTunes Store app.<br/>
<br/>
tvOS 17.2 also includes a sidebar that houses content from both Apple's services and streaming services that integrate with the tvOS Watch Now feature. The sidebar makes it easier to access a range of content, and there are dedicated sections for Search, Watch Now, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-tv-plus/">Apple TV+</a>, Sports, Library, and the Store for purchases.<br/>
<br/>
Apple is expected to release tvOS 17.2 to the public next week.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_TV">Apple TV (Neutral)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-tv-and-home-theater.100">Apple TV and Home Theater</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/06/apple-itunes-movies-tv-show-apps-tvos-17-2/">Apple Eliminating iTunes Movies and TV Show Apps in tvOS 17.2</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-eliminating-itunes-movies-and-tv-show-apps-in-tvos-17-2.2412998/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hyundai's luxury brand <a href="https://www.genesis.com/us/en/home">Genesis</a> has been gaining increasing attention over the course of its relatively short lifetime, and I recently had a chance to try out a 2023 Electrified GV70 SUV to see how the infotainment experience stacks up for an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> owner.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/12/2023-gv70.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-925005" /><br/>
My test vehicle was a high-end Prestige trim with a beautiful 14.5-inch widescreen center screen, complemented by a 12.3-inch all-digital driver display featuring autostereoscopic 3D technology, plus an additional head-up display for viewing key information without having to take your eyes off the road.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/12/2023-gv70-sky.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-925017" /><em>Infotainment display</em></div><br/>
The GV70's center display is mounted high on the dashboard and set back a decent amount, which puts it in a good spot for glancing at without having to look too far away from what's in front of you, but the positioning and widescreen dimensions make operating it via the touchscreen a bit of a reach. To address that, Genesis also includes a rotary controller and a number of buttons within easy reach of the driver on the center console.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/12/2023-gv70-rotary-controller.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-925012" /><em>Rotary controller located above a rotary shifter dial</em></div><br/>
The rotary controller includes a dial for navigating between user interface elements, and you can press the dial to register your selection, but the dial can also be rocked to move more quickly move between pages and sections in the system. The surface of the controller is also touch-sensitive, allowing you to draw out letters when trying to search for destinations or performing other tasks where text entry is needed. Voice commands are typically a much superior method for this, however.<br/>
<br/>
In addition to the rotary controller, there are several buttons located directly above it on the console to quickly access specific functions in the infotainment system, including dedicated Home, Menu, and Back buttons. Scroll-style buttons also allow for easy volume and tuning adjustments.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/12/2023-gv70-steering-wheel.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-925013" /><em>Steering wheel controls</em></div><br/>
Steering wheel controls are another method for controlling some infotainment functions, and there's even another strip of buttons on the center stack below the climate controls with quick access to the map, navigation, radio, and media functions. This strip and the steering wheel each have a user-configurable "star" button that can be set to jump you straight into <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/carplay/">CarPlay</a>.<br/>
<br/>
And yes, climate controls have their own dedicated section separate from the main infotainment screen and they include a combination of physical and digital controls that works quite well. The driver and passenger each have a knob for adjusting the temperature for their respective sides of the cabin, and there additional commonly used controls to the outside of these dials.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/12/2023-gv70-climate.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-925014" /><em>Dedicated climate controls</em></div><br/>
These climate controls are not individual buttons, but the small panels they're on do move when pressed, providing some tactile feedback. Other settings like heated and cooled seats, heated steering wheel, and manual fan speed adjustments are made on a digital screen, so they're harder to manage by feel, although they do provide some haptic and audio feedback when pressed.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/12/2023-gv70-menu.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-925348" /><em>Menu screen for native infotainment</em></div><br/>
For the most part, the native infotainment system has a sleek, modern look, with high-resolution graphics and a logical layout of screens and panels that's easy to navigate using the rotary controller or by touch.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/12/2023-gv70-nature-sounds.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-925349" /><em>Nature sounds</em></div><br/>
A full array of functions are available, from SiriusXM to onboard navigation to EV data. There are even a variety of soothing nature sounds that can be piped throughout the cabin, and there's a weather app complete with a radar view.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/12/2023-gv70-nav.jpeg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-925350" /><em>Built-in navigation</em></div><br/>
The onboard navigation is functional and helpful with both overview and next-turn views available simultaneously while a route is in progress, but the look could stand some modernization to better match the rest of the infotainment system.<br/>
<br/>
In the driver's display, Genesis includes the neat Blind-Spot View Monitor system that Hyundai has offered for a number of years, which uses cameras on the side-view mirror to display a live video feed of your blind spot on a given side when you engage your turn signal. It's a handy feature that I wish was common in more brands.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/12/2023-gv70-driver-display.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-925015" /><em>Driver display with stereoscopic 3D view and Blind-Spot View Monitor</em></div><br/>
The other clever driver's display feature that comes as part of the Prestige package on the GV70 is the 3D aspect. It's something you really have to experience in person to fully grasp, but it takes advantage of parallax with offset images to turn gauges and other digital aspects of the instrument cluster into three-dimensional representations that give a sense of depth.<br/>
<br/>
A camera pointed at the driver tracks their position and gaze, adjusting the 3D effect accordingly. The whole thing is a bit gimmicky, but it's kind of neat and stands out as something different to help set the high-end Genesis trims apart.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/12/2023-gv70-charging.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="940" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-925010" /><em>USB ports and wireless charging pad in center console</em></div><br/>
The GV70 includes a pair of USB-A ports (one for charge and data and one for charging only) in a small cubby on the center console that also includes a wireless Qi charger. As with many car chargers, it can be difficult to get a reliable wireless charging connection, likely due to the slab-style charger design and the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;'s camera bump and case lip interfering with positioning on the charger.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/12/2023-gv70-rear-climate-usb-jpg.jpeg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-925011" /><em>Rear climate controls and USB charging ports</em></div><br/>
On the rear of the center console are climate controls and a pair of USB-A charging ports for rear passengers.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>CarPlay</h2><br/>
As you'd hope, the Electrified GV70 supports &zwnj;CarPlay&zwnj;, but unfortunately only via a wired connection. Genesis is currently a victim of an odd split in Hyundai's infotainment systems wherein lower-tier systems support both wired and wireless &zwnj;CarPlay&zwnj; while higher-end systems with built-in navigation only support wired &zwnj;CarPlay&zwnj;. There have been rumors of Hyundai and Genesis adding wireless &zwnj;CarPlay&zwnj; to some of these higher-tier systems on select models via a software update in the relatively near future, but we'll have to see if that pans out.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/12/2023-gv70-carplay-home.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-925006" /><em>&zwnj;CarPlay&zwnj; Home screen</em></div><br/>
So if you want to use &zwnj;CarPlay&zwnj;, you're going to have plug your phone in, and it's unfortunate that more modern USB-C ports aren't included. The charging and USB compartment includes a spring-loaded cover to help hide things away, but if you've got a Pro Max-sized &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; with a cable sticking out the bottom for &zwnj;CarPlay&zwnj;, you'll have a very difficult time getting that cover to close properly.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/12/2023-gv70-carplay-maps.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-925007" /><em><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-maps/">Apple Maps</a> in &zwnj;CarPlay&zwnj;</em></div><br/>
&zwnj;CarPlay&zwnj; looks great on the GV70's widescreen display, which even leaves enough room for a sidebar off to the right where you can view other functions from the native infotainment system. You can see your current radio station or audio track information, a compass, a dedicated clock, vehicle battery information, and more.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/12/2023-gv70-carplay-now-playing.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-925008" /><em>Now Playing screen in &zwnj;CarPlay&zwnj;</em></div><br/>
On the downside, &zwnj;CarPlay&zwnj; is a single-screen experience in the GV70, as it doesn't get the latest <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/01/volvo-dual-screen-apple-maps-carplay/">dual-screen experience</a> rolling out recently to Volvo and a few other brands, and it doesn't even get the more basic &zwnj;Apple Maps&zwnj; navigation prompts in the driver display or the head-up display that are available on many vehicles. Navigation prompts from the native navigation system do appear in the head-up display, so that's a plus for using the Hyundai/Genesis system. <br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/12/2023-gv70-carplay-dashboard.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-925009" /><em>&zwnj;CarPlay&zwnj; Dashboard view</em></div><br/>
<h2>Wrap-up</h2><br/>
The Genesis Electrified GV70 starts at a little over &#36;65,000, with the Prestige package on my test model, a paint upcharge, and destination fees bringing things to a little shy of &#36;75,000. It's not cheap, and its range clocks in at only 236 miles (and even a bit less than that in real-world review), but overall it's a fun drive with a boost mode that lets you go 0–60 in around four seconds.<br/>
<br/>
It's also packed with technology from the gorgeous center display to the 3D driver's display to a fingerprint authentication system. My main gripes on this front are the lack of wireless connectivity for &zwnj;CarPlay&zwnj;, USB-A ports rather than USB-C, and an inconvenient phone storage/charging setup.<br/>
<br/>
Hopefully, those issues will be addressed in upcoming model years (or even via software updates to existing models such as for wireless &zwnj;CarPlay&zwnj;), but even now if the issues aren't deal-breakers and you're willing and able to spend that kind of cash, the Electrified GV70 is a pretty compelling package. A gasoline-powered version is also available for a still-premium but significantly lower price tag, but you'll be missing out on some of the fun EV features like zippy acceleration.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/carplay/">CarPlay</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/genesis/">Genesis</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/homepod-homekit-carplay-home-auto-technology.193">HomePod, HomeKit, CarPlay, Home & Auto Technology</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/review/2023-genesis-electrified-gv70-carplay/">Review: 2023 Genesis Electrified GV70 Offers Lots of Tech, but You&#039;ll Need a Cable for CarPlay</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/review-2023-genesis-electrified-gv70-offers-lots-of-tech-but-youll-need-a-cable-for-carplay.2412995/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>
