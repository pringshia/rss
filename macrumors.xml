		<description><![CDATA[<a href="https://www.sonos.com/en-us/home">Popular speaker company Sonos</a> is planning to enter several new product markets that will see it competing with Apple devices, according to a new report from <em><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-11-21/sonos-plans-400-500-headphones-tv-set-top-box-video-roam-2-new-sound-bar">Bloomberg</a></em>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/11/airpods-max-cyber.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-875245" /><br/>
Upcoming over-ear headphones will take on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-max/">AirPods Max</a>, which Apple has not yet updated. Sonos plans to offer the headphones in black and white, and features will include voice control navigation and synchronization with Sonos speakers, soundbars, and subwoofers. Sonos plans to price its over-ear headphones at &#36;400 to &#36;500, which is in line with the &zwnj;AirPods Max&zwnj; as well as over-ear headphones from companies like Sony and Bose.<br/>
<br/>
<em>Bloomberg</em>'s report suggests that Sonos isn't aiming to introduce a more technical feature set than Apple provides, with the company instead focusing on customization and fine-tuning sound with a "Passport" app. Sonos has been working on the headphones for several years, and they are set to be available as early as April 2024. In the future, the company may also develop a set of earbuds that would be similar to the AirPods.<br/>
<br/>
In late 2024 or 2025, Sonos will introduce a set-top streaming box akin to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a>. The device will serve as a hub for Sonos audio equipment with support for Dolby Atmos and Dolby Vision, and it will offer apps and streaming services much like existing set-top boxes.<br/>
<br/>
Sonos is developing an Android-based operating system for the set-top box, expected to be priced somewhere between &#36;150 and &#36;200. Talks are being conducted with cable companies about possible live television offerings, and Sonos may even create its own video service.<br/>
<br/>
Sonos is developing new amplifiers and in-ceiling speakers for professional installers, a version of the Era 100 speakers for businesses, and a high-end TV sound bar that will be an update to the Arc. For consumers, Sonos is developing a new version of the Sub that will sync with the planned set-top box, along with an updated Roam speaker.<br/>
<br/>
Earlier this month, Sonos CEO Patrick Spence confirmed that Sonos is planning to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/16/sonos-new-product-category/">enter a new product category</a> that will "complement" current Sonos devices and that will "delight customers and drive immediate revenue." Sonos expects to generate more than &#36;100 million from new products in 2024.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/bloomberg-com/">Bloomberg</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/sonos/">Sonos</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/21/sonos-headphones-set-top-box/">Sonos to Launch &#36;400+ Headphones and Set-Top Box, Competing with Apple Devices</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/sonos-to-launch-400-headphones-and-set-top-box-competing-with-apple-devices.2411635/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today shared its annual holiday-themed ad, which is titled "Fuzzy Feelings." This year, the mini film focuses on an animator who is working on a holiday-themed video in the spare moments she has off from her office job.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe title="Fuzzy Feelings Apple Holiday Film" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LMH5-IHrras" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div><br/>
The stop motion video stars her curmudgeonly boss, who is shown chastising her for being late, giving her last minute work, and generally being miserable. She finds an outlet in depicting him in uncomfortable situations, such as being shocked by Christmas lights or covered by snow while standing out on the street.<br/>
<br/>
After her seemingly horrible boss hands out handmade holiday gifts, she sees another side of him, and changes her animation to something much more positive.<blockquote>Creativity has the power to change the way we see each other, and the world. Sometimes, seeing things through a new lens can make all the difference. You make the holidays.</blockquote>Apple shares a unique holiday ad each year, and these ads often win awards. Apple accompanied the video with a behind-the-scenes look at how it was filmed.<br/>

According to Apple, it was created using an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a> Max and then edited on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/">MacBook Air</a>.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-ads/">Apple Ads</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/21/apple-fuzzy-feelings-holiday-ad/">Apple Shares Heartwarming &#039;Fuzzy Feelings&#039; Holiday Ad</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-shares-heartwarming-fuzzy-feelings-holiday-ad.2411625/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Samsung has expanded its <a href="https://howl.me/ck3cNcgXTyo">Black Friday sale</a> with new discounts across smartphones, smartwatches, tablets, computers, and home appliances. This is in addition to the deals we've been tracking on Samsung's best TVs and monitors, like the Smart Monitor M8 and ViewFinity S9 5K Display.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/samsung-best-holiday.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-923404" /><em><small>Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with Samsung. When you click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment, which helps us keep the site running.</small></em><br/>
<br/>
Right now, both of these have all-time low prices on Amazon. The Smart Monitor M8 is available for <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2FB0C3WMX69W%2Fref%3Dox_sc_act_title_1%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26smid%3DATVPDKIKX0DER%26th%3D1%26geniuslink%3Dtrue"><strong>&#36;399.99</strong></a> (&#36;300 off) and the ViewFinity S9 5K Display is available for <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FSAMSUNG-ViewFinity-Thunderbolt-DisplayPort-LS27C900PANXZA%2Fdp%2FB0CB71BY87%2Fref%3Dsr_1_3%3Fcrid%3D2UE1OI1RNSBZ3%26keywords%3Dsamsung%2Bviewfinity%2Bs9%26qid%3D1700578795%26sprefix%3Dsamsung%2Bviewfinity%252Caps%252C133%26sr%3D8-3"><strong>&#36;1,265.31</strong></a> (&#36;334 off). The latter deal has been fluctuating on Amazon, so if it does disappear, Samsung has a solid second-best offer at <a href="https://howl.me/ck3bAoFu1ed">&#36;1,299.99</a> for the next few days.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://howl.me/ck3cNcgXTyo"target="_blank"><div class="fancybutton"><div class="fancybadge">SITEWIDE SALE</div>Samsung Black Friday</div></a></div><br/>
<br/>
Samsung is encouraging users to shop through the Shop Samsung mobile app this season, which has some exclusive deals and deep discounts on smartphones, smartwatches, and mobile accessories. Clicking any of the Samsung links in this post while on mobile should give you the option to install the app.<br/>
<br/>
Other than monitors and TVs, we're also now tracking quite a few deals on refrigerators, tablets, and computers below. These sale prices will be live for this week only, so be sure to check out Samsung's event before the best prices of the year disappear.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple in recent days began selling refurbished second-generation AirPods Pro for the first time in select European countries, <a href="https://www.apple.com/uk/shop/refurbished/accessories/airpods">including the U.K.</a>, <a href="https://www.apple.com/at/shop/refurbished/accessories/airpods">Austria</a>, <a href="https://www.apple.com/be-fr/shop/refurbished/accessories/airpods">Belgium</a>, <a href="https://www.apple.com/de/shop/refurbished/accessories/airpods">Germany</a>, <a href="https://www.apple.com/ie/shop/refurbished/accessories/airpods">Ireland</a>, <a href="https://www.apple.com/nl/shop/refurbished/accessories/airpods">the Netherlands</a>, <a href="https://www.apple.com/pl/shop/refurbished/accessories/airpods">Poland</a>, and <a href="https://www.apple.com/ch-de/shop/refurbished/accessories/airpods">Switzerland</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/09/airpods-pro-2.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-862208" /><br/>
Importantly, these are the second-generation AirPods Pro with a Lightning/MagSafe charging case, originally released in November 2022. Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/12/apple-announces-usb-c-iphone-airpods-earpods/">updated the second-generation AirPods Pro</a> with a USB-C/MagSafe charging case and a few other changes in September 2023, but those are not yet available on Apple's refurbished store.<br/>
<br/>
The refurbished AirPods Pro are discounted by approximately 15% compared to original pricing. Apple says all of its refurbished products undergo "full functionality testing" and are "put through a thorough cleaning process and inspection."<br/>
<br/>
Keep in mind that there are often better deals available from third-party resellers, although deals in European countries can be harder to find. In the U.S., brand new AirPods Pro with a USB-C charging case are <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/19/black-friday-deals-airpods-2-2/">currently on sale for &#36;189.99 on Amazon</a>, so U.S. customers should avoid purchasing these refurbished ones once available there.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[The 2022 40mm GPS Apple Watch SE has further dropped in price on Amazon today, down to <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0CHX2F5NJ%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1"><strong>&#36;179.00</strong></a>, from its original price of &#36;249.00. This beats the price we tracked over the weekend by &#36;10 and is a new all-time low price on the second-generation wearable.<br/>
<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tim-cook/">Tim Cook</a> has revealed that Apple has "very detailed" succession plans in place for when the time comes to replace him as chief executive of the company, but he also said he has no intention of going anywhere just yet.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JXQYO8poXC8?si=LA8kqQMWr6vpopXF" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><br/>
In a 45-minute interview for the BBC Sounds podcast <em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JXQYO8poXC8">Dua Lipa: At Your Service</a></em> hosted by singer Dua Lipa, Cook admitted that he does not know how long he will remain at Apple. <br/>
<br/>
"I love it," he said, reflecting back on 25 years at the company. "I can't envision my life without being there, so I'll be there for a while." However, when asked if there was any succession plan at Apple, Cook continued: <br/>
<blockquote>"We're a company that believes in working on succession plans, so we have very detailed succession plans. Because something unpredictable can always happen. I could step off the wrong curb tomorrow. Hopefully that doesn't happen, I pray that it doesn't."<br/>
<br/>
Dua Lipa: "Are you able to say who is in line for succession?"<br/>
<br/>
"I can't say that, but I would say that my job is to prepare several people for the ability to succeed, and I really want the person to come from within Apple, the next CEO. So that's my role: That there's several for the board to pick from."</blockquote>In the broad-ranging interview, the Apple CEO described a day in the life of &zwnj;Tim Cook&zwnj;, and shared his experience growing up in a blue-collar family in Alabama, and the arc of his career that ultimately brought him to Apple. <br/>
<br/>
The 63-year-old also discussed Apple's environmental sustainability efforts, as well as his thoughts on the excessive use of smartphones, the value of collaboration and equal representation, philanthropy, and the promise and perils of AI, generative AI, and the "life-changing" potential of large language models.

		<description><![CDATA[WhatsApp has started allowing users to authenticate their account on a device with an email address as an alternative to using a phone number, for times when cellular coverage is poor. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/03/Whatsapp-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2250" height="1266" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-786421" /><br/>
The new option to link an account to an email address does not replace SMS verification via a six-pin code, and opening a WhatsApp account still requires the user to provide a number. But with email verification, existing users now also have the means to authenticate their account on a device with an internet connection even if their cellular service is unavailable. <br/>
<br/>
Spotted by <a href="https://wabetainfo.com/whatsapp-for-ios-23-24-70-whats-new/">WABetaInfo</a>, the new feature is rolling out today as part of version 23.24.70 of WhatsApp for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> in the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a>. To use email verification in the updated app, tap the Settings tab, choose Account, then select Email Address.<br/>
<br/>
WhatsApp has also been working on a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/25/whatsapp-usernames-in-development/">username feature</a> that could potentially provide people on the messaging service with an additional layer of privacy when communicating with others. <br/>
<br/>
The username feature is still in development, so it's too early to tell how they will work when they are rolled out, but it could be that the platform intends to let users reach other people by entering a username instead of a phone number, similar to Telegram. <div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/whatsapp/">WhatsApp</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/wabetainfo/">WABetaInfo</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/21/whatsapp-email-verification-authenticate-account/">WhatsApp Gains Email Address Verification for Authenticating Accounts</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/whatsapp-gains-email-address-verification-for-authenticating-accounts.2411581/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<title>iPhone 16 Pro Again Rumored to Include Tetraprism Telephoto Lens With 5X Optical Zoom</title>

		<description><![CDATA[Both the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a> Pro and &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; Pro Max will include Apple's tetraprism Telephoto lens with improved zoom capabilities, Apple analyst <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/">Ming-Chi Kuo</a> <a href="https://medium.com/@mingchikuo/大立光潛望鏡鏡頭良率-獲利顯著提升-為2024年潛望鏡相機顯著成長的主要受益者-largans-periscope-lens-yield-profitability-improves-6b94601b5710">reiterated today</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/iPhone-16-Cameras-Feature-1.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-919420" /><br/>
Apple introduced a new tetraprism lens system for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a> Max, enabling 5x optical zoom for the first time. The camera technology was not added to the &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj;, marking one of the first times that Apple has added camera technology to one Pro device and not the other.<br/>
<br/>
The limitation was rumored to be because of space constraints, with only the Pro Max able to accommodate the hardware, but yield may have also been a factor. According to Kuo, when lens supplier Largan was producing the tetraprism hardware for the &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; Max in the third quarter of 2023, production yield was at just 40 percent. Yield has now improved to 70 percent or more.<br/>
<br/>
Apple is planning to increase the size of the &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; Pro to 6.3 inches, up from 6.1 inches, which will allow for more space for camera hardware. With the size increase and the yield improvement, Apple has addressed the factors that likely kept the tetraprism lens limited to the larger Pro Max <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>.<br/>
<br/>
It is not yet clear if Apple has plans to make improvements to the tetraprism lens in 2024. One rumor <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/07/18/iphone-16-pro-max-super-telephoto-camera/">has suggested</a> Apple is working on a "super telephoto camera" with a much longer focal length, but we've heard little about it at this point.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/">Ming-Chi Kuo</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/20/iphone-16-pro-telephoto-lens-tetraprism/">iPhone 16 Pro Again Rumored to Include Tetraprism Telephoto Lens With 5X Optical Zoom</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-16-pro-again-rumored-to-include-tetraprism-telephoto-lens-with-5x-optical-zoom.2411568/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Anker's early Black Friday sale has transitioned into a full-fledged <a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=J2shFQg6J/U&mid=43469&murl=https://www.anker.com/black-friday-sale?ref=naviMenu">Black Friday event</a> today, so we're highlighting all of the best discounts you'll find in the new sale. With this sale, you can save up to 60 percent on Anker accessories, and you don't need to purchase more than one accessory at a time to get a bundle discount this time around. There are also still a few "mystery boxes" that can include hundreds of dollars in savings, if you're willing to risk not knowing what you're buying ahead of time.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/anker-new-xmas.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-923261" /><em><small>Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with Anker. When you click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment, which helps us keep the site running.</small></em><br/>
<br/>
In terms of the base sale, there are plenty of great accessories that you can buy to take advantage of the savings. A new highlight is the <a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=J2shFQg6J/U&mid=43469&murl=https://www.anker.com/products/b1336-20000mah-power-bank-kit?ref=black-friday-sale&amp;variant=42726143852694">Prime 20,000 mAh Power Bank with 100W Charging Base</a> for &#36;129.50, down from &#36;184.99. If you just want a portable battery with a smart display, the <a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=J2shFQg6J/U&mid=43469&murl=https://www.anker.com/products/a1289?ref=black-friday-sale&amp;variant=41974285041814">PowerCore 24,000 mAh Power Bank with Smart Digital Display</a> is at &#36;92.00, down from &#36;159.99.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=J2shFQg6J/U&mid=43469&murl=https://www.anker.com/black-friday-sale?ref=naviMenu"target="_blank"><div class="fancybutton"><div class="fancybadge">UP TO 60% OFF</div>Anker Black Friday Sale</div></a></div><br/>
<br/>
At the <a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=J2shFQg6J/U&mid=43469&murl=https://www.anker.com/black-friday-sale?ref=naviMenu">bottom of the Black Friday sale page</a>, Anker also has a few blind boxes on sale, priced at &#36;19.99 (up to &#36;219.99 in value) and at &#36;29.99 (up to &#36;219.99 in value). These mystery boxes include one Anker accessory, but you won't know what you're getting until they arrive. All items in the &#36;19.99 box are worth more than &#36;19.99, and all items in the &#36;29.99 box are worth more than &#36;29.99, so no matter what you'll be getting a deal.<br/>
<br/>
All mystery box items are non-returnable (with the exception of quality issues). These could net you a huge discount with a collection of solid stocking stuffers for the holidays, if you're willing to take the blind box risk. Anker's Black Friday sale will run through December 3.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Starting with iOS 17, all iPhone 14 and iPhone 15 models offer a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/12/roadside-assistance-via-satellite/">roadside assistance via satellite feature</a> that allows users in the U.S. to contact roadside assistance company AAA for vehicle service when outside of cellular and Wi-Fi coverage. In a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf1c6oGZNrw">video shared today</a>, tech reviewer Brian Tong provided a look at the feature in action.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/apple-roadside-assistance.jpg" alt="" width="1596" height="897" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-910510" /><br/>
To use the feature, open the Messages app and start a new message. Next, type "roadside" into the address field. When there is no cellular and Wi-Fi coverage available, a "Roadside Assistance" option will appear. Tap on "Roadside Assistance" and follow the on-screen instructions to connect your iPhone to a Globalstar satellite and request help from AAA. You'll need to be outside with a clear view of the sky and horizon, according <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT213886">to Apple</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Tong demoed the feature by having AAA come to jump-start his car's battery. The feature can also be used if you are locked out of your vehicle, have a flat tire, run out of fuel, and for other services offered by AAA.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wf1c6oGZNrw?si=domPxy2EuWlL5jUN" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><br/>
The feature is included free for two years starting at the time of activation of any new iPhone 14 or iPhone 15 model, with service covered per your AAA membership plan. If you aren't a AAA member, you can still use the service on a pay-per-use basis.<br/>
<br/>
Apple said roadside assistance via satellite is available "beginning" in the U.S., suggesting that it will expand the feature to additional countries over time, but it has not provided any specific details. In Canada, there is a AAA-like organization called CAA, so it would make sense for the service to expand to that country eventually.<br/>
<br/>
Roadside assistance via satellite is an extension of the Emergency SOS via satellite feature. Apple recently <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/15/emergency-sos-extra-year-iphone-14/">extended free usage of the satellite features</a> for an additional year.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-17/">iPadOS 17</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-17.241">iOS 17</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-17.242">iPadOS 17</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/20/iphone-roadside-assistance-feature-tested/">iPhone&#039;s Roadside Assistance via Satellite Feature Tested in New Video</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphones-roadside-assistance-via-satellite-feature-tested-in-new-video.2411543/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Black Friday discounts have arrived for the Beats Studio Pro wireless Bluetooth headphones, available on Amazon for <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FBeats-Studio-Pro-Personalized-Compatibility%2Fdp%2FB0C8PR4W22%3Fref_%3Dast_sto_dp%26th%3D1"><strong>&#36;169.95</strong></a>, down from &#36;349.99. Amazon has these headphones in all four colors: Black, Deep Brown, Navy, and Sandstone.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/beats-snow.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-923214" /><em><small>Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with Amazon.

<br/>
This new sale beats the previous all-time low price seen earlier in November by about &#36;10. At a discount of &#36;180, this is just over 50 percent off the original price of the accessory and one of the best headphones-related Black Friday discount we've seen this season.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
The headphones come with improved sound quality, voice performance, comfort and durability, and connectivity compared to previous generation Beats. They launched back in June and have been coming down in price ever since the end of the summer.<br/>

		<title>Apple Preparing to Release iOS 17.1.2 Update for iPhone</title>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple appears to be internally testing an iOS 17.1.2 update for the iPhone, based on evidence of the software in our website's analytics logs within the past few days.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/iOS-17.1.2-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-923208" /><br/>
As a minor update, iOS 17.1.2 should be focused on bug fixes, but it's unclear exactly which issues might be addressed. Some users have continued to experience Wi-Fi issues on iOS 17.1.1, released earlier this month, so perhaps iOS 17.1.2 will include the same <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/30/ios-17-2-beta-addresses-wifi-issues/">fix for Wi-Fi connectivity issues</a> that Apple included in the iOS 17.2 beta. Some users have also experienced minor bugs related to push notifications and HomeKit.<br/>
<br/>
Apple typically does not release any software updates or betas during the week of U.S. Thanksgiving, as most corporate employees in the company are given the full week off due to the holiday. This means that iOS 17.1.2 is likely to be released next week, similar to how iOS 16.1.2 was released on November 30 last year.<br/>
<br/>
iOS 17.1.1 already <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/07/apple-releases-ios-17-1-1/">fixed a BMW wireless charging issue</a> affecting the iPhone 15 lineup, and an issue preventing the Weather app widget from showing a snow icon.<br/>
<br/>
iOS 17.2 has been in beta testing for nearly a month now, and it is expected to be released in mid-December. The update includes <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ios-17-2-beta-features/">many new features and changes</a>, including Apple's new Journal app, support for spatial video recording on iPhone 15 Pro models, a Translate option for the Action button on iPhone 15 Pro models, the ability for Apple Music subscribers to collaborate on playlists, an iMessage Contact Key Verification security option for high-profile individuals, additional Weather and Clock widgets, and more.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-17/">iPadOS 17</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-17.241">iOS 17</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-17.242">iPadOS 17</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/20/apple-preparing-ios-17-1-2/">Apple Preparing to Release iOS 17.1.2 Update for iPhone</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-preparing-to-release-ios-17-1-2-update-for-iphone.2411534/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Images purporting to depict a new battery designed for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a> Pro today leaked online, showing a new metal casing and a slightly larger capacity.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/iPhone-16-Side-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="3532" height="1986" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-913689" /><br/>
The images come from the leaker known as "<a href="https://twitter.com/kosutamisan/status/1726430084838617152?s=46">Kosutami</a>," who has disseminated <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/kosutami/">accurate information</a> about Apple's plans in the past. If authentic, the images are the first to be shared of the &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj;'s components.<br/>
<br/>
The battery is said to be designed for an early stage &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; Pro prototype with a 3,355 mAh capacity. The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a> contains a 3,274 mAh battery, meaning that prototype &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; Pro models currently feature a battery that is just 2.5% larger. The new battery also features a redesigned connector.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Battery of early stage iPhone 16 Pro Proto<br>Features glossy metal shell, 3355mAh Capacity(13.02Wh), LCV 4.48V(Limited Charge Voltage)<br>Current stage prototype has changed some design: from glossy surface to frosted metal shell, and with a redesigned connector<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Apple?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Apple</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/appleinternal?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#appleinternal</a> <a href="https://t.co/QvguZ7CrtL">pic.twitter.com/QvguZ7CrtL</a></p>&mdash; Kosutami (@KosutamiSan) <a href="https://twitter.com/KosutamiSan/status/1726430084838617152?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 20, 2023</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div> <br/>
<br/>
The most significant change is the transition from a black foil casing, the likes of which have been used on every <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> model thus far, to a frosted metal shell. This change improves the thermal efficiency of the battery, with no significant impact on the component's weight. The Apple Watch used to feature batteries with black foil casing, but starting with the 40mm Apple Watch Series 7, Apple began adopting metal shells for improved thermals.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/apple-watch-40mm-battery-change-ifixit.jpg" alt="" width="1922" height="1133" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-923106" /><em>The new and old Apple Watch battery designs (via iFixit).</em></div><br/>
<br/>
The early component images appear to confirm information <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/16/iphone-16-new-thermal-design/">shared last week</a> that said Apple plans to introduce a new thermal system on the &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; to reduce overheating. In addition to batteries with metal shells on the &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; Pro models, the entire &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; lineup is rumored to feature a graphene heat-sink to reduce overheating. Graphene has high thermal conductivity, surpassing that of copper, which is currently used in &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; heat-sinks. Apple has been interested in graphene for thermal management for some time, filing patents related to its exploration of the material for heat dissipation in portable devices.<br/>
<br/>
The moves appear to come partly in response to widely encountered <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/28/iphone-15-pro-overheating-reports/">overheating issues</a> experienced with the &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj;, which Apple ostensibly addressed through a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/04/apple-releases-ios-17-0-3/">software update</a> earlier this year.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/kosutami/">Kosutami</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/20/iphone-16-pro-leak-reveals-redesigned-battery/">First Alleged iPhone 16 Pro Component Leak Reveals Redesigned Battery</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/first-alleged-iphone-16-pro-component-leak-reveals-redesigned-battery.2411505/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple will miss its original aim to launch <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a> in January 2024 and is now likely to release the mixed reality headset to consumers in March of next year, according to <em>Bloomberg</em>'s <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/apple-vision-pro-setup.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-923100" /><br/>
Writing in his <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2023-11-19/apple-in-house-technologies-team-eyes-making-cameras-screens-modems-batteries-lp5j5h6b?srnd=technology-vp">Power On newsletter</a>, Gurman says Apple "still needs to get its distribution plans in shape and conduct further testing." Apple also typically holds its spring event in March, and company will likely use that to promote the headset and preview additional apps. <br/>
<br/>
&zwnj;Apple Vision Pro&zwnj; reportedly has such a complex design that Apple has been forced to make "drastic cuts" to its <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/07/03/apple-vision-pro-drastic-production-cuts/">production forecasts</a> because of difficulties with manufacturing. Apple is expected to make fewer than 400,000 units in 2024, and the headset will initially only launch in the US, only coming to more markets including Canada and the UK towards the end of next year.<br/>
<br/>
Select Apple retail employees in the United States have been <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/22/apple-to-host-secretive-vision-pro-training-event/">sent to Apple's Cupertino headquarters</a> to receive Vision Pro training. Employees selected for training will be responsible for training other team members at their stores.<br/>
<br/>
When the Vision Pro launches, flagship stores will have dedicated Vision Pro hands-on areas, while other stores will have one or two units for customers to try.<br/>
<br/>
Apple last week seeded to developers a sixth beta of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/visionos/">visionOS</a>, the software designed to run the headset, and it includes <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/15/apple-vision-pro-onboarding-videos-visionos-beta-6/">new onboarding videos</a> shown to the user during the setup process, indicating that development work on the headset is nearing completion.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/bloomberg-com/">Bloomberg</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-vision-pro.209">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/20/apple-vision-pro-likely-launch-march-2024/">Apple Vision Pro Headset Likely to Launch Around March 2024</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-vision-pro-headset-likely-to-launch-around-march-2024.2411499/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple eventually plans to build its own custom modem into cellular MacBook models that could arrive in 2028 at the earliest, according to <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/Apple-WWDC23-MacBook-Air-15-in-color-lineup-230605.jpg" alt="" width="1960" height="1102" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-898453" /><br/>
Apple has reportedly been working on its own modem since 2018, as it seeks to move away from Qualcomm's component currently used in iPhones. The timeframe for launching the modem has <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/16/apple-in-house-5g-modem-delays/">slipped several times</a> and is now expected to be ready around 2026, and Gurman now hears that Apple has plans for the chip appearing in other Apple devices further down the line.<br/>
<br/>
Writing in his latest <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-11-16/apple-project-to-replace-modems-made-by-qualcomm-falls-further-behind-to-2026?srnd=technology-vp">Power On newsletter</a>, Gurman says that Apple's custom technology aspirations include integrating an in-house modem into its system-on-a-chip (SoC), which would eventually see the launch of MacBooks with built-in cellular connectivity. <br/>
<br/>
Gurman says Apple will "probably need two or three additional years to get that chip inside cellular versions of the Apple Watch and iPad – and the Mac, once the part is integrated into the company's system-on-a-chip."<br/>
<br/>
Apple has explored the possibility of developing MacBooks with cellular connectivity in the past. Indeed, the company reportedly considered launching a MacBook Air with 3G connectivity, but former CEO Steve Jobs said in 2008 that Apple decided against it, since it would take up too much room in the case. An integrated SoC would solve that problem.<br/>
<br/>
Gurman's latest newsletter also said some of Apple's other ongoing in-house chip projects include camera sensors, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/06/apple-developing-custom-batteries-for-2025/">batteries</a>, a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/01/09/apple-in-house-modem-chips-2024/">combined Wi-Fi and Bluetooth chip</a> that will eventually replace parts from Broadcom, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/03/microled-apple-watch-still-on-track-for-2025/">Micro-LED displays for Apple devices</a>, and a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/26/apple-watch-blood-glucose-up-to-seven-years-away/">non-invasive glucose monitoring system</a>.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/bloomberg-com/">Bloomberg</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/20/macbook-integrated-cellular-modem-2028/">Apple Plans to Equip MacBooks With In-House Cellular Modems</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-plans-to-equip-macbooks-with-in-house-cellular-modems.2411497/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[A massive discount has arrived for Apple's 9th generation iPad on Amazon, which has the 64GB Wi-Fi tablet for <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB09G9CJM1Z%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26th%3D1%26geniuslink%3Dtrue"><strong>&#36;229.99</strong></a>, down from &#36;329.00.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/11/ipad-9-snowflakes.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-874200" /><em><small>Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with Amazon. When you click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment, which helps us keep the site running.</small></em><br/>
<br/>
This is the lowest price we've ever tracked for the 9th generation iPad, and Amazon has it in both Silver and Space Gray. The latter color does appear to have somewhat dwindling stock as of writing.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB09G9CJM1Z%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26th%3D1%26geniuslink%3Dtrue"target="_blank"><div class="fancybutton"><div class="fancybadge">&#36;99 OFF</div>9th Gen iPad (64GB Wi-Fi) for &#36;229.99</div></a></div><br/>
<br/>
If you want a bit more storage, you'll find a similar &#36;99 discount on the 256GB model. It's available for <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB09G96TFF7%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1"><strong>&#36;379.99</strong></a>, down from &#36;479.00 on Amazon.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB09G96TFF7%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1"target="_blank"><div class="fancybutton"><div class="fancybadge">&#36;99 OFF</div>9th Gen iPad (256GB Wi-Fi) for &#36;379.99</div></a></div><br/>
<br/>
This 2021 iPad lacks the design changes that arrived in the 10th generation models, but at this &#36;99 discount it's a great entry-level tablet for kids or family members who don't need a Pro-level tablet.<br/>
