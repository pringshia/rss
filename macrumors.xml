		<description><![CDATA[Apple's next-generation <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a> models are expected to be announced in a matter of weeks, so what can customers expect from the highly anticipated new machines?<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/M3-iPad-Feature-3.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-917548" /><br/>
The 2022 &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; was a minor update that added the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m2/">M2</a> chip, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-pencil/">Apple Pencil</a> hover, and specification upgrades like Wi-Fi 6E and Bluetooth 5.3 connectivity. The &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; as a whole has generally only seen relatively small updates in recent years, but rumors indicate that the next-generation ‌&zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj;‌ will be the first major update to the product since 2018, introducing "<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/27/new-ipad-pro-and-redesigned-magic-keyboard/">fundamental changes</a>." Below are some of the most important rumors about the new machines to be aware of as we approach their announcement.<br/>
<br/>
<h3>Revamped, Thinner Design</h3><br/>
The &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; has retained the same design through four successive generations since 2018. Multiple reports suggest that the biggest design change coming to the new models will be a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/20/upcoming-oled-ipad-pro-thinner/">substantial reduction in thickness</a>, reducing from 5.9 mm to 5.1mm and 6.4mm to 5.0 mm, respectively.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/13-inch-ipad-pro-2024.jpg" alt="" width="3832" height="1316" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-938781" /><br/>
<br/>
<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/28/2024-ipad-pro-cad-drawings/">CAD renders</a> indicate that there will be no other major design changes, but there have been vague <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/08/ipad-air-ipad-pro-landscape-facetime-camera/">reports</a> about the device potentially featuring a landscape front-facing camera like the 10th-generation <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>, a much more natural placement for video calls when using a Magic Keyboard. Rumors <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/24/rumor-ipad-pro-horizontal-cameras-apple-logo/">dating back to 2021</a> have suggested that a relocated front-facing camera is headed to the &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj;. Such a change would likely also require changes to the location or charging system of the &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj;, since the wireless charging components for the accessory are currently located where the camera would move to.<br/>
<br/>
Earlier rumors suggested that a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/04/ipad-pro-2022-wireless-charging-capabilities/">glass back</a> could come to a future &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; model, which would be a major design change for the device, but it is no longer clear if this is still a possibility.<br/>
<br/>
<h3>M3 Chip for Improved Performance</h3><br/>
The next-generation &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; is widely expected to feature Apple's M3 chip to deliver improved performance and efficiency.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/12/m3-feature-black.jpg" alt="" width="1810" height="1018" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-827879" /><br/>
The M3 is based on the A17 Pro chip, which is manufactured using TSMC's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/3nm/">3nm</a> fabrication process. In benchmark tests, the M3 outperforms the ‌‌&zwnj;M2&zwnj;‌‌ by about 17% in single-core tasks and approximately 21% in multi-core tasks. A tentpole feature of the M3 is a completely redesigned GPU with hardware-accelerated ray-tracing, leading to dramatically improved graphics capabilities. In GPU performance, measured by Metal benchmarks, the M3 exhibits a notable improvement of around 15% over the ‌‌&zwnj;M2&zwnj;‌‌.<br/>
<br/>
<h3>4TB Storage Option</h3><br/>
Apple will offer next year's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/oled-ipad-pro/">OLED iPad Pro</a> models with a 4TB storage option, a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/04/ipad-pro-may-have-4tb-storage-option/">rumor</a> coming out of Asia claimed. Since 2021, the &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; has been available with 128GB, 256GB, 512GB, 1TB, or 2TB of storage.<br/>
<br/>
If Apple increases the maximum storage of its forthcoming &zwnj;OLED &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; Pro&zwnj; models to 4TB, it would likely also increase the base storage to 256GB to maintain five capacity categories, making all seventh-generation models capable of recording ProRes in 4K at 30fps.<br/>
<br/>
It is also worth noting that &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; RAM is variable based on storage capacity, so &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; models with 128GB, 256GB, or 512GB of storage come with 8GB of RAM, while &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; models with 1TB or 2TB of storage feature 16GB of RAM. Whether that means a 4TB &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; would feature 24GB or 32GB of RAM is unknown, but not improbable.<br/>
<br/>
<h3>OLED Display Technology</h3><br/>
OLED display technology is perhaps the most anticipated upgrade coming to the next-generation &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; models. The current 11-inch model features an LCD display, while the 12.9-inch model has a mini-LED display.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/07/iPad-Pro-OLED-Feature-2.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-853666" /><br/>
Apple already uses OLED displays on the Apple Watch and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>, but has yet to bring the technology to larger devices. OLED displays use less power, sport greater color accuracy, and provide much better and more consistent contrast than LCD displays. As a significant upgrade, the change will likely be very prominent in the Apple's marketing materials for the next-generation &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
<h3>Bigger Screens and Slimmer Bezels?</h3><br/>
The new &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; models are also rumored to get <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/12/29/oled-ipads-2024/">display size increases</a> from 11- to 11.1-inches and 12.9- to 13-inches, facilitated by slimmer borders around the screen. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/05/ipad-pro-m1-feature.jpg" alt="" width="1780" height="1001" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-800056" /><br/>
This would allow the footprint of the devices to remain the same while increasing display size. The slight increases are unlikely to add any meaningful functionality to the device, but they would provide a more modern "all-screen" appearance. However, display analyst Ross Young has since cast doubt on this rumor as it may simply be a misinterpretation of screen size rounding.<br/>
<br/>
<h3>Higher Prices</h3><br/>
The more advanced OLED display technology in the next-generation models is expected to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/09/2024-oled-ipad-pro-starting-prices/">drive up the iPad Pro's price</a>, with current estimates starting at &#36;1,500 and &#36;1,800 for the 11-inch and 13-inch models, respectively. Pricing on the current 11-inch &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; starts at &#36;799, while the 12.9-inch &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; starts at &#36;1,099. Models with cellular connectivity are available for an additional &#36;200 over the base price for each storage tier.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/06/oled-ipad-pro-price-lower-than-first-thought/">More recent reports</a> suggest that the price hikes may have been overstated and they may not exceed a &#36;160 increase, but it does look like higher prices are on the way.<br/>
<br/>
<h3>Improved Cameras</h3><br/>
The &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; has had the same 12-megapixel main rear camera with a ƒ/1.8 aperture since 2017. The 12-megapixel ultra wide camera with an ƒ/2.4 aperture and brighter True Tone flash have also remained the same since its introduction on the 2021 &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj;. Camera upgrades are <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/16/ipad-mini-7-rumored-to-feature-these-four-upgrades/">rumored for other future iPad models</a> with related hardware such as the seventh-generation <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-mini/">iPad mini</a>, so it follows that similar improvements are on the way for the &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
Since 2021, the &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; has also featured a 12-megapixel front-facing camera with an ƒ/2.4 aperture. With 2022's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-14/">iPhone 14</a> models, Apple introduced an upgraded 12-megapixel front-facing camera with an ƒ/1.9 aperture and autofocus. It seems plausible that this hardware could be ready to trickle down to the &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; in its next incarnation.<br/>
<br/>
The current &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; Pros support Smart HDR 4, so an upgrade to Smart HDR 5 is likely. The Photonic Engine and other iPhone-only photography and videography features could also make their way to the next &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
<h3>MagSafe Wireless Charging</h3><br/>
In 2022, it was reported that Apple was <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/04/ipad-pro-2022-wireless-charging-capabilities/">testing a new iPad Pro with a glass back</a> to enable wireless charging capabilities. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/12/iPad-Pro-Magsafe-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-926995" /><br/>
A <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/01/14/ipad-pro-glass-apple-logo-prototype-report/">subsequent report</a> suggested that Apple may have ultimately scrapped the glass back design after testing due to concerns over breakability. Citing sources familiar with Apple's design plans, the report claimed that Apple has developed &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; prototypes with a larger Apple logo made of glass, which would still allow for wireless charging. One of the prototypes was said to feature <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe-battery-pack/">MagSafe</a> with stronger magnets than on the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; to prevent accidental damage, and it was also said to support faster wireless charging speeds compared to &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; on the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
There is no guarantee that the &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; with a glass back or Apple logo will ever be released, but rumors do seem to agree that Apple has extensively explored some kind of wireless charging solution for the &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj;. In December, <em>MacRumors</em> <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/18/ipad-pro-magsafe-charging/">obtained information</a> suggesting that the new &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; models might include support for &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; charging, and this now appears to be Apple's chosen wireless charging technology for the device<br/>
<br/>
Apple is also rumored to be working on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/04/ipad-pro-2022-wireless-charging-capabilities/">reverse wireless charging</a> for the ‌&zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj;‌, which would allow users to charge their iPhones, AirPods, and other accessories by laying them on the back of the ‌&zwnj;iPad&zwnj;‌. Apple has <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/05/apple-researching-wireless-charging-ecosystem/">filed multiple patents</a> related to this feature.<br/>
<br/>
<h3>Redesigned Magic Keyboard for 'Laptop' Experience</h3><br/>
According to <em>Bloomberg</em>'s <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a>, Apple is planning a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/27/new-ipad-pro-and-redesigned-magic-keyboard/">complete revamp</a> of its Magic Keyboard accessory for the &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; that makes the device more laptop-like. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2018/11/m1-ipad-pro-magic-keyboards.jpg" alt="" width="2400" height="1350" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-795764" /><br/>
The updated version of the Magic Keyboard for &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; will offer a larger trackpad, addressing criticisms of the current model, and "makes the &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; look even more like a laptop than the current setup." The area around the keyboard itself will apparently be <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/03/gurman-new-ipad-magic-keyboard-to-feature-aluminum/">made of aluminum</a>, resembling the top case of MacBooks, to provide a sturdier structure.<br/>
<br/>
The exterior shell of the keyboard will retain the silicone cover material used on the current model and a single USB-C port. Gurman mused that the redesign using more premium materials could lead Apple to raise the accessory's &#36;299 price point.<br/>
<br/>
The Weibo leaker known as <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/16/ipad-mini-7-rumored-to-feature-these-four-upgrades/">"Instant Digital" claims</a> that the next-generation Magic Keyboard will also be 100% carbon neutral thanks to its redesign and use of different materials. Last year, Apple unveiled its first carbon neutral products: The aluminum <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch/">Apple Watch Series 9</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch-se/">Apple Watch SE</a> when paired with a new Sport Loop, as well as the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch-ultra/">Apple Watch Ultra 2</a> when paired with a new Trail Loop or Alpine Loop. The company plans for all of its products to be carbon neutral by 2030.<br/>
<br/>
<h3>New Apple Pencil</h3><br/>
A new &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; is now <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/05/new-apple-pencil-to-launch-this-month/">actively rumored</a> to arrive alongside the next-generation &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; models. The current, second-generation &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; is now well over five years old.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/Apple-Pencil-on-iPad-Close.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-939788" /><br/>
In March 2021, the leaker known as "Mr. White" shared an image purporting to depict a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/03/new-apple-pencil-allegedly-leaks/">next-generation Apple Pencil prototype</a> that featured a shorter design, glossy finish, and a larger, deeper tip. Apple was believed to have worked on a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/13/apple-working-on-smaller-apple-pencil/">smaller Apple Pencil</a> designed for the &zwnj;iPad mini&zwnj;, as well as a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/16/apple-planned-iphone-apple-pencil/">&#36;49 model for the iPhone</a>, but both products never emerged and are said to have been canceled entirely.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/02/apple-pencil-3-could-feature-magnetic-tips/">Multiple rumors</a> suggested that the third-generation will include range of interchangeable magnetic tips to emulate different drawing styles. There have also been report about <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2020/07/17/apple-pencil-color-sensor-patent/">color-sampling capabilities</a>, but little else is known about what the new accessory could offer later this month.<br/>
<br/>
<h3>No Apple Event, But Announcement Any Day Now</h3> <br/>
Reports from a wide range of sources are consistent that the new &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; models will be announced in March. While it was initially speculated that Apple would host an event to introduce the new models, the company is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/03/no-apple-event-for-new-ipads-macs-gurman/">no longer expected to hold a traditional event</a> for the announcements. Instead, Apple is reportedly planning to announce new products on its website with a "series of online videos and marketing campaigns."<br/>
<br/>
Last week, Apple announced the new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/">MacBook Air</a> models featuring the M3 chip, so this rumor now seems to be true. As a result, Apple is highly likely to reveal the new &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; Pros via a press release on its website during a morning in the next few weeks, likely on a Monday or Tuesday, followed by launch on a following Friday. The new &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; models may launch <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/11/new-ipads-end-of-march-or-april-gurman/">toward the end of the month or in April</a>, according to <em>Bloomberg</em>'s &zwnj;Mark Gurman&zwnj;, but they could appear as soon as tomorrow.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#11-iPad-Pro">11" iPad Pro (Don't Buy)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#12-9-iPad-Pro">12.9" iPad Pro (Don't Buy)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipad.137">iPad</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/11/2024-ipad-pro-key-rumors/">2024 iPad Pro: Key Rumors to Be Aware of Ahead of Announcement</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/2024-ipad-pro-key-rumors-to-be-aware-of-ahead-of-announcement.2421676/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Shortly after the Vision Pro launched, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg made it clear that he believes the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/13/meta-quest-3-apple-vision-pro-zuckerberg/">Quest 3 is the better VR headset</a>, and over the weekend, he again <a href="https://www.threads.net/@zuck/post/C4Rrh9wrbU0">took to Threads</a> to reiterate his belief that the &#36;3,500 Vision Pro is inferior to the &#36;500 Quest 3 (via <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2024/03/11/zuckerberg-vision-pro-vs-meta-quest-3/"><em>9to5Mac</a></em>).<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-914163" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/meta-quest-3.jpg" alt="" width="1385" height="779" /><br/>
Analyst Benedict Evans said that the Vision Pro is the "device Meta wants to reach in 3-5 years," and that it is confusing that Meta VR engineers have suggested the Vision Pro is "basically just the same thing" as the Quest. In response, Zuckerberg said that the Quest "is better" than the Vision Pro now, and that if the Meta Quest has the "motion blur," weight, or "lack of precision inputs" as the Vision Pro in the future, then Meta will have "regressed significantly."<br/>
<blockquote>I don't think we're saying the devices are the same. We're saying Quest is better. If our devices weigh as much as theirs in 3-5 years, or have the motion blur theirs has, or the lack of precision inputs, etc, then that means we'll have regressed significantly. Yes, their resolution is higher, but they paid for that with many other product tradeoffs that make their device worse in most ways. That's not what we aspire to.</blockquote><br/>
Zuckerberg also took offense to the Meta Quest being called "a games device," and clarified that some of the top apps on the Quest are social, browser, and video player apps.<br/>
<blockquote>Actually, 3 of the top 7 Quest apps are already social apps - Horizon, VR Chat, and Rec Room. Browser and video player are top apps too. Fitness isn't as high up there, but has a passionate community as well. So I think the narrative that these headsets are only for games is out of date. And yes, more resolution is better - but trading off ergonomics and motion blur isn't a clear win when Quest's resolution is also quite good.</blockquote><br/>
Device weight and "motion blur" have been two points that Zuckerberg has focused on in his criticism of the Vision Pro, and he has dismissed the higher resolution of Apple's headset as unnecessary given the "tradeoffs" that he sees.<br/>
<br/>
Zuckerberg in February said that <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/13/meta-quest-3-apple-vision-pro-zuckerberg/">the Quest 3 is superior</a> because it is 7x less expensive than the Vision Pro, it's more comfortable, the Quest is "crisper," there are "precision controllers," and there's a "deeper" immersive content library.<br/>
<br/>
Compared to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a>'s 4K microLED displays, the Quest 3 has two 2K LCD panels. It also weighs in at 515 grams, while the Vision Pro weighs 600 to 650 grams depending on the Light Seal combination used, and the Quest does not have a separate battery pack.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AppleVisionPro">Vision Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-vision-pro.209">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/11/apple-vision-pro-zuckerberg-comments/">Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg Again Disparages Apple Vision Pro</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/meta-ceo-mark-zuckerberg-again-disparages-apple-vision-pro.2421672/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[<em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman today held a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/live-blog/2024-03-11/apple-car-canceled--live-q-a-with-bloomberg-s-mark-gurman">Q&A session focused on the Apple Car</a>, in which he revealed that the vehicle's chip would have been equivalent to four M2 Ultra chips combined. He also said the vehicle had an underlying "safetyOS" system that was one part of the overall operating system, but he did not elaborate.<br/>
<br/>

Gurman also briefly touched on a few other topics, including that Apple apparently "just started formal development" of a new MacBook Pro with an M4 chip. He did not provide any additional details about the chip, which has yet to be announced by Apple.<br/>
<br/>
Apple announced the M1 chip for Macs in November 2020, followed by the M2 chip in June 2022 and the M3 chip towards the end of October 2023, so there has been around a year-and-a-half gap between each of the chips being introduced. If that pattern continues, the M4 chip would be released in the first half of 2025. However, a late 2024 release is also possible if the interval shrinks to one year.<br/>
<br/>
Apple last updated the MacBook Pro lineup in October with M3, M3 Pro, and M3 Max chips. As part of that refresh, Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/30/apple-discontinues-13-inch-macbook-pro/">discontinued the 13-inch MacBook Pro</a> and replaced it with a new base model 14-inch MacBook Pro with the M3 chip. Apple has also <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/30/apple-announces-imac-with-m3-chip/">updated the iMac</a> <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/04/apple-announces-m3-macbook-air/">and MacBook Air</a> with the M3 chip, leaving the Mac mini, Mac Studio, and Mac Pro as the only current-generation Macs still equipped with the M2 family of chips.<br/>

Apple's chipmaking partner TSMC is expected to begin volume production of chips <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/28/apple-designing-2nm-silicon-chips/">based on its 2nm process</a> in the second half of 2025, so the M4 chip will likely remain 3nm like the M3 chip. However, the M4 chip will likely be manufactured with an enhanced version of TSMC's 3nm process for improved performance and power efficiency.<br/>
<br/>
Last month, the Taiwanese publication <em>Economic Daily News</em> reported that the M4 chip will <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/14/iphone-16-upgraded-neural-engine-rumor/">feature an upgraded Neural Engine</a> with "significantly" more cores for artificial intelligence tasks, but no other specific details are known about the chip at this time.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro/">MacBook Pro 14 & 16" </a></div><div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m4-macs/">M4 Macs</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Pro_16">14" & 16" MacBook Pro (Neutral)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macbook-pro.90">MacBook Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/11/apple-reportedly-developing-m4-macbook-pro/">Apple Reportedly &#039;Just Started Formal Development&#039; of M4 MacBook Pro</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-reportedly-just-started-formal-development-of-m4-macbook-pro.2421664/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple recently started distributing internal builds of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a> to factories and relevant vendors, according to credible information shared on X by a private account with a track record of sharing accurate details on Apple's plans. The version of iOS that Apple provides at this stage is called "VendorUI," and access to it is strictly controlled. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/iOS-18-Mock-Feature-Baubles.jpg" alt="" width="2250" height="1266" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-909207" /><br/>
Sent out on an annual basis, VendorUI is a variant of iOS that is provided to factories for quality control testing. Because it has a pre-production version of the iOS user interface that Apple won't publicly unveil until WWDC, Apple is careful about where it is distributed. VendorUI can include references to new features, new settings or changes in branding. Unlike the versions of iOS used by Apple's software engineers, VendorUI often has certain apps omitted, ensuring that only the apps necessary for testing are present.<br/>
<br/>
With every iOS release, Apple develops several different versions of iOS:<br/>
<br/>
<ul><br/>
<li><strong>Release</strong> – Stock iOS intended for end-consumers.<br/>
<li><strong>InternalUI</strong> – Created for Apple's software engineers, often contains pre-production version of the iOS user interface, with unreleased and unannounced features.<br/>
<li><strong>VendorUI</strong> – Designed for quality control testing in factories and can contain elements of pre-production iOS user interface.<br/>
<li><strong>NonUI</strong> – Developed for hardware engineers and calibration machines, does not feature the standard iOS user interface.<br/>
<li><strong>LLDiags</strong> – Intended for use in low-level diagnostics and has no user interface at all except for a simple diagnostics menu (Diags). <br/>
</ul><br/>
<br/>
The distribution of the VendorUI version of &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj; means that we could soon start seeing more iOS features leak because the operating system is available to a larger number of people.<br/>
<br/>
Even without VendorUI, information about iOS has started to come out. We've heard that &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj; will have a heavy focus on AI, and there <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/07/ios-18-macos-15-accessibility/">will be new Accessibility features</a>, such as Adaptive Voice Shortcuts and Live Speech Categories. Internal versions of iOS can also contain hardware information, and back in December, we shared details <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/20/ios-18-code-four-new-iphone-models/">on the iPhone 16 hardware</a> sourced from &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj; code.<br/>

		<title>iOS 18 and macOS 15 to Include Updated Freeform App With &#039;Scenes&#039; Feature</title>

		<description><![CDATA[With <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a> and macOS 15, Apple intends to introduce a plethora of new features and enhancements affecting system applications and settings. Through industry sources, <em>MacRumors</em> has received details about the updated version of the Freeform app, which is set to include an interesting addition.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/11/Freeform-App-Icon.png" alt="" width="1200" height="630" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-873728" /><br/>
Known as "Freeform Scenes," the new feature will give users the option to select specific sections or "Scenes" within their boards for easier navigation. Once selected and named, users will have the ability to easily return to them after viewing other areas of the board. Users will have the option to edit scenes after the fact as well, and will even be able to collaborate with others in doing so. Our sources claim that Freeform Scenes will be compatible with <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/icloud/">iCloud</a>, allowing for easier sharing and editing. <br/>
<br/>
The controls for the Freeform Scenes UI will be located near the zoom controls, towards the bottom left area within the app. Users will see a new sandwich-bar type icon with three vertical lines, and tapping or clicking the icon will show the Scenes UI. The Scenes UI includes a bar with individual arrow icons for easier navigation between Scenes, along with a square icon between the two arrows. Clicking or tapping the square icon will present the user with additional options to select or navigate between scenes.<br/>
<br/>
Apple has also developed the following keyboard shortcuts for Freeform Scenes:<br/>
<br/>
<ul><br/>
<li><strong>Save</strong> – Shift + Command + S<br/>
<li><strong>Next Scene</strong> - Option + Command + ]<br/>
<li><strong>Previous Scene</strong> – Option + Command + [<br/>
</ul><br/>
<br/>
Although this feature is in testing, it is worth noting that not all features make it to release, and Apple also sometimes delays new additions until a later version of iOS. While Freeform Scenes is in development for &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj; and macOS 18, it could be pulled or introduced at a later date. <br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple CEO <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tim-cook/">Tim Cook</a> today appeared in Porsche's video announcement for the Taycan Turbo GT electric performance car.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ql_OvZBWEFg?si=JNG_h0flofRX-7w3" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><br/>
The Porsche Taycan Turbo GT is the most powerful production car the brand has ever made. During its premiere video, Porsche briefly showed off its custom race engineer cockpit app for the Vision Pro that allows a spectator to view laps from the perspective of the driver accompanied by key statistics and a track map in 3D space.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/porsche-taycan-visionos-track-app.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-940598" /><br/>
Speaking to Porsche CEO Oliver Blume, Cook congratulated the automaker on the new vehicle and highlighted the potential of the Vision Pro headset to "reimagine track experiences."<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote>Good morning, Oliver. Congratulations to you and the Porsche team on the new record you've set with this incredible new vehicle. It's these kinds of extraordinary milestones that show the world what can happen when a team of incredibly dedicated people come together to break new ground on a big idea. Porsche has always been known for excellence and we're proud to see a number of our products play a role in what you do and it's so great to see Apple Vision Pro helping reimagine track experiences.<br/>
<br/>
I believe deeply that spatial computing has the potential to revolutionize virtually every industry and you're showing one of the many ways Apple Vision Pro is going to make the impossible possible.</blockquote><br/>
<br/>
The CEOs noted their companies' partnerships over the years, such as the Porsche app and Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/carplay/">CarPlay</a> integration. Porsche is often among the first automakers to adopt and integrate with Apple technologies, such as <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2016/04/28/porsche-2017-718-cayman-carplay/">Apple CarPlay</a>, a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2019/08/20/porsche-taycan-integrated-apple-music/">native Apple Music app</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/07/10/porsche-carplay-app-integration/">vehicle functions in Apple CarPlay</a>, and the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/20/first-next-generation-carplay-vehicles-announced/">next-generation CarPlay experience</a>. The brand even offers <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2020/04/23/carplay-radios-classic-porsches/">CarPlay-equipped audio systems</a> compatible with classic Porsche vehicles dating as far back as the 1960s. Nevertheless, Cook's appearance in another company's announcement video is unusual.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[The debate over whether 8GB of RAM is sufficient for a Mac has long been a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/08/8gb-ram-m3-macbook-pro-like-16-gb-pc/">topic of contention</a>. The controversy goes back to at least 2012, when Apple launched the first MacBook Pro with Retina display, which started with 8GB of RAM. Apple still offers 8GB as the base configuration for its <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/30/apple-announces-m3-macbook-pros/">14-inch MacBook Pro</a>, not to mention its <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/">M3 iMac</a> and the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/04/apple-announces-m3-macbook-air/">latest MacBook Air</a> models. Coupled with the significant cost of upgrading to higher memory options, Apple's decision has once again sparked discussions about the adequacy and value of this configuration.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/m3-macbook-air-green.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-940237" /><br/>
Of course, Macs have changed a lot over the last decade. For one, Apple no longer relies on Intel processors to power its machines, having developed its own Apple silicon, which is faster and more power efficient. This is because Apple's custom chips use "system-on-a-chip" (SoC) architecture, which integrates several processing cores (CPUs), graphics cores (GPUs), cache memory, and several other components within a single physical package.<br/>
<ul><li><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-silicon-buyers-guide/">Apple Silicon Buyer's Guide: Which Chip Should You Choose?</a></li><br/>
<li><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/14-inch-vs-16-inch-macbook-pro/">Late 2023 MacBook Pro Buyer's Guide: 14-Inch vs 16-Inch Models</a></li><br/>
<li><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/macbook-air-generations-compared/">MacBook Air Buyer's Guide: Comparing the Generations</a></li></ul><br/>
Apple's M-series of chips also use something called "unified memory," which sits alongside the SoC. Apple's adoption of this high-bandwidth, low-latency memory means the main chip avoids having to communicate data between different memory locations, and it makes the memory pool available for both the CPU and GPU, allowing it to be allocated dynamically depending on the task at hand. <br/>
<br/>
While the overall result of this integrated SoC architecture is better performance and efficiency, the downside is that Apple's unified memory is fixed at the point of purchase and cannot be upgraded at a later date. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/07/M3-chip-series-unified-memory-architecture.jpg" alt="" width="2400" height="1350" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-920050" /><br/>
Opting for more unified memory is not cheap either. For instance, going from the base 8GB of unified memory to 16GB or 24GB costs an extra &#36;200 and &#36;400, respectively. Therefore, it's important when buying a new Mac that you choose the right amount for your individual needs. User opinions on this topic are diverse, with some finding 8GB adequate and others feeling constrained. Ultimately, it comes down to what you want to do on your Mac. Here are the main factors to keep in mind.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="8gb_or_more_ram">8GB or More RAM?</h2><br/>
<ul><li><strong>Daily Tasks and Light Usage</strong>: For basic tasks like web browsing, document editing, and media consumption, 8GB of RAM generally suffices. Modern Macs use features like memory compression and intelligent allocation, which help macOS run smoothly even during multitasking.<br/>
<li><strong>Professional and Creative Workloads</strong>: For more intensive tasks such as video editing, 3D modeling, or software development, 8GB may be limiting, and can cause slower performance and reduced efficiency, as <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/10/8gb-ram-in-m3-macbook-pro-proves-the-bottleneck/">independent tests have shown</a>. This is especially true if you work on advanced projects that require enormous files and content libraries.</li></ul> <br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="wrapping_up">Wrapping Up</h2><br/>
Ultimately, when buying a Mac, opting for 8GB of unified memory is a cost-effective option if you have light usage requirements, and it offers adequate performance for everyday tasks. However, if you intend to use more demanding applications, it may be worth paying the extra for more memory. This will reduce the risk of the memory acting as a system bottleneck, and allow the Apple silicon in your Mac to perform at its maximum potential. <br/>
<ul><li><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/08/8gb-ram-m3-macbook-pro-like-16-gb-pc/">8GB RAM on M3 MacBook Pro 'Analogous to 16GB' on PCs, Claims Apple</a></li></ul><br/>
Starting at &#36;1,599, Apple's 14-inch M3 MacBook Pro comes with 8GB of unified memory, and choosing 16GB or 24GB costs an extra &#36;200 and &#36;400, respectively. However, it's worth noting that after factoring in the extra &#36;200 for 16GB, an M3 Pro model with 18GB and several other extra features is only &#36;200 more at &#36;1,999.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, if your main concern is affordability and/or portability, it may be worth considering a MacBook Air instead. Starting at &#36;1,099, the new 13-inch MacBook Air with M3 chip has a 16GB configuration option for &#36;200 extra, totaling &#36;1,299. If you're looking for a bigger display, the 15-inch MacBook Air starts at &#36;1,299, with the 16GB option taking the price up to &#36;1,499. <br/>
<br/>
Bear in mind that the M3 version of the MacBook Pro has a HDMI 2.1 port and SDXC card slot, while the MacBook Air models do not. The entry-level MacBook Pro also offers 22 hours of battery on a single charge, compared to 18 hours on the M3 MacBook Air. In addition, the M3 MacBook Air models have an LCD display, whereas the M3 MacBook Pro uses a superior mini-LED display.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/">iMac</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/">MacBook Air</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro/">MacBook Pro 14 & 16" </a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iMac">iMac (Buy Now)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#15-MacBook-Air">15" MacBook Air (Buy Now)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Pro_16">14" & 16" MacBook Pro (Neutral)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Air">13" MacBook Air (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/imac.91">iMac</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macbook-air.122">MacBook Air</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macbook-pro.90">MacBook Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/is-8gb-ram-enough-macbook-air-pro-2024/">Is 8GB of RAM Enough for a Mac in 2024?</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/is-8gb-of-ram-enough-for-a-mac-in-2024.2421631/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[AirPods Pro will gain a new "hearing aid mode" with the release of iOS 18 later this year, according to the latest report by <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2019/10/airpods-pro-noise-cancellation.jpg" alt="AirPods Pro" width="1212" height="659" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-716249" /><br/>
Writing in the subscriber edition of his regular <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-03-10/what-did-the-apple-car-look-like-inside-apple-s-planned-self-driving-vehicle-ltlic8vt">Power On newsletter</a>, Gurman claims that the "big news" for AirPods Pro in the near term will be support for a hearing aid-style function when iOS 18 drops in the fall. <br/>
<br/>
To be clear, this isn't the first time we have heard a potential hearing aid feature for AirPods Pro. The first rumor appeared in a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/13/future-airpods-temperature-posture-hearing-aid/">2021 <em>Wall Street Journal</em> report</a>,  but it was previously framed as a feature that would be exclusive to a next-generation model of AirPods Pro. However, Apple in September 2022 released the second-generation AirPods Pro, while the company more recently released a refreshed model with a USB-C port. <br/>
<br/>
AirPods Pro already offer a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/enable-conversation-boost-airpods-pro/">Conversation Boost</a> feature, which boosts the volume and clarity of people directly in front of the wearer, but Apple has not advertised the earbuds as a hearing aid device, because this would require FDA regulatory approval. <br/>
<br/>
As per the <a href="https://www.fda.gov/media/87330/download">FDA</a>, a hearing aid is defined as "any wearable device designed for, offered for the purpose of, or represented as aiding persons with or compensating for, impaired hearing." This definition encompasses both air-conduction and bone-conduction devices in a variety of styles (for example, behind-the-ear, in-the-canal, or body worn). <br/>
<ul><li><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/new-airpods-pro-features-ios-17-how-to-use/">Complete Guide to Using AirPods Pro's Newest Features</a></li></ul><br/>
Notably, in August 2022 the FDA approved a <a href="https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/consumer-products/hearing-aids">new category</a> of over-the-counter hearing aids that do not have to adhere to the same strict legal requirements. The new category is called Personal sound amplification products (PSAPs). PSAPs are defined as any "electronic product that is intended for non-hearing impaired consumers to amplify sounds in certain environments, such as for hunting or other recreational activities, and is not intended to aid persons with or compensate for impaired hearing."<br/>
<br/>
Unlike hearing aid devices, PSAPs are "not intended to treat, cure, mitigate, or prevent disease, and are not intended to affect the structure or function of the body." As such, there is no regulatory classification or product code for these products, and there are no requirements for legal registration by manufacturers or listing of these products with the FDA.<br/>
<br/>
It is not yet clear whether Apple will need FDA clearance in order to make explicit or implicit claims about the rumored "hearing aid mode," which may not even adopt this exact name. If, for example, Apple subsequently suggests that AirPods Pro are for users with certain types or severity of hearing loss/impaired hearing, or for use as an alternative to a hearing aid, then they will require FDA regulatory approval to be marketed as such. <br/>

Apple is set to preview iOS 18 in June at its annual Worldwide Developers Conference, and will inevitably release the major software update when the iPhone 16 series is launched, which is likely to be sometime in September.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/">AirPods Pro</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a></div><div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/bloomberg-com/">Bloomberg</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AirPods-Pro">AirPods Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/airpods.216">AirPods</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/11/airpods-pro-to-gain-hearing-aid-mode-ios-18/">Gurman: AirPods Pro to Gain &#039;Hearing Aid Mode&#039; in iOS 18</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/gurman-airpods-pro-to-gain-hearing-aid-mode-in-ios-18.2421623/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This weekend, we're tracking a new sale at Samsung with savings on the company's best smartphones, smartwatches, tablets, and laptops. These discounts are part of Samsung's larger <a href="https://howl.me/clM8jtwNoQg">Discover Samsung Spring Sale</a>, which we started covering last week with deals on monitors, storage, audio, and more.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/samsung-hero-blue.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-940340" /><em><small>Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with some of these vendors. When you click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment, which helps us keep the site running.</small></em><br/>
<br/>
The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/05/discover-samsung-massive-discount/">best monitor deal from our original post</a> is still live today: you can get the ViewFinity S9 5K Smart Monitor for <a href="https://howl.me/clLNLtD8GuF"><strong>&#36;899.99</strong></a>, down from &#36;1,599.99. At &#36;700 off this a very solid second-best price on the 2023 display, which has a matte display, modular 4K SlimFit camera, and support for Thunderbolt 4.<br/>
<br/>
Additionally, when you <a href="https://howl.me/clM4GKBZeXm">sign up to learn more</a> about Samsung's upcoming TV and audio product lineup, you can get &#36;100 off your purchase. The new slate of Samsung TVs and audio equipment is set to be unveiled on March 21, and this &#36;100 discount offer will be available through that date.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Smartphones</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/samsung-galaxy-s24.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-940345" /><br/>
Samsung's newest smartphones launched back in January and you can get <a href="https://howl.me/clM7Wp8lyTV">some pretty big discounts</a> on the devices right now. Most of these offers do require you to trade in an existing smartphone and will be applied as credits on your bill, and Samsung covers discounts from carriers including AT&T, Verizon, T-Mobile, and US Cellular.<br/>
<br/>

In terms of smartwatches, Samsung has the <a href="https://howl.me/clM72xyoRru">Galaxy Watch6 and the Watch5 on sale</a>, with up to &#36;400 in savings. You can get these smartwatches with a straight cash discount, or opt for a cellular plan and gain access to more savings with an eligible trade-in.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://howl.me/clM7XLzEMwt"target="_blank"><div class="fancybutton"><div class="fancybadge">UP TO &#36;400 OFF</div>Galaxy Watch6 Classic with Rugged Sport Band</div></a></div><br/>

Similar to the Galaxy smartphones, Samsung is offering discounts on both cellular and Wi-Fi models of the Galaxy Tab line. If you go with the Wi-Fi models, you can get about &#36;100 off the base price of Galaxy Tab S9 Series, depending on the model.<br/>
<br/>
If you opt for the cellular devices from participating carriers, you can get more in savings in the form of bill credits after eligible trade-ins.<br/>
<br/>

Samsung has a few laptop deals with solid discounts shared below, but it's worth again noting that if you have a device to trade in you can get even bigger markdowns on these computers. For the Galaxy Book 4, Samsung is also offering a free 2TB portable SSD (&#36;219.99 value) with purchase of select models.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://howl.me/clM8biIOrzQ"target="_blank"><div class="fancybutton"><div class="fancybadge">&#36;220 OFF</div>Galaxy Book4 360 for &#36;1,099.99</div></a></div><br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Earlier this week, Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/04/apple-announces-m3-macbook-air/">announced</a> new 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Air models, the first Mac updates of the year featuring M3 series chips. But there are other Macs in Apple's lineup still to be updated to the latest M3 processors.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/M3-Mac-Pro-Studio-Mini-Feature-2.jpg" alt="" width="2138" height="1202" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-940283" /><br/>
So, where do the Mac mini, Mac Studio, and Mac Pro fit into Apple's M3 roadmap for the year ahead? Here's what the latest rumors say.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Mac Mini</h2><br/>
Apple announced ‌M2‌ and ‌M2‌ Pro Mac mini models in January 2023, which at the time of writing is over 400 days ago. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/M3-Mac-Mini-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-920522" /><br/>
<em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman said in July that he believes a new Mac mini won't emerge <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/07/23/new-macbook-pro-and-mac-mini-with-m3-2024-launch/">until late 2024 at the earliest</a>, and we haven't heard any other rumors that move the dial since then. On the other hand, Apple may choose not to upgrade the Mac mini this year and skip the M3 entirely. Approximately 26 months passed between the launch of the M1 Mac mini and the update to the M2 Mac mini​​. Going forward, perhaps the company has an 18-month upgrade cycle in mind, which would mean we could see an M4 Mac mini in the spring of 2025.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Mac Studio</h2><br/>
Apple updated the ‌Mac Studio with ‌M2‌ series chips in June 2023. ‌Mac Studio‌ models come with either the ‌M2‌ Max or ‌M2‌ Ultra chip, so logic would suggest we should expect equivalent M3 variants.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/M3-Mac-Studio-Feature-1.jpg" alt="" width="2271" height="1278" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-940094" /><br/>
However, according to a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/05/m3-ultra-mac-studio-to-launch-in-mid-2024/">January</a> report by Taiwanese research firm TrendForce, a new Mac Studio model will launch in mid-2024 with a more powerful M3 Ultra chip than we might otherwise expect.<br/>
<br/>
According to the report, the M3 Ultra chip will be fabricated with TSMC's N3E node, just like the A18 chip that is expected to debut in the iPhone 16 lineup later this year. This means it would be Apple's first N3E chip. N3E is an enhanced version of TSMC's 3nm process, offering slightly better performance and higher production yield.<br/>
<br/>
A couple of days after the TrendForce report, Gurman said he believes Apple is working on a new Mac Studio that is likely to be offered with the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/07/apple-working-on-new-mac-studio-and-mac-pro/">as-yet-unannounced fourth variant of the M3 chip</a>. This will, like previous generations, double the components of the "Max" version, meaning that it will feature up to 32 CPU cores and 80 GPU cores. Gurman says that it is likely to launch in the second half of 2024.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Mac Pro</h2><br/>
Along with the Mac Studio, Apple updated the Mac Pro with ‌M2‌ series chips during WWDC in June 2023. The ‌Mac Pro‌ is only available in a single chip configuration, and currently ships with the ‌M2‌ Ultra chip that's used in the Mac Studio.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/M3-Mac-Pro-Feature-1.jpg" alt="" width="2271" height="1278" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-940090" /><br/>
Logically then, we should expect the next ‌Mac Pro‌ to receive an update to add the same M3 Ultra chip alongside the ‌Mac Studio‌, just like it received the ‌M2‌ Ultra chip last year. Like previous generations, this will likely double the components of the "Max" version, meaning that it will feature up to 32 CPU cores and 80 GPU cores.<br/>
<br/>
Indeed, Gurman thinks Apple is likely to refresh the Mac Pro with this new high-end chip in the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/07/apple-working-on-new-mac-studio-and-mac-pro/">second half of the year</a>. Notably, he does not believe that Apple is likely to again abandon the machine after only one year.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>MacBook Pro – Already Updated</h2><br/>
Apple in November 2023 <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/30/apple-announces-m3-macbook-pros/">updated its MacBook Pro lineup</a> with M3 and M3 Pro chips, so the company's work is already done in that regard.  <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/New-MacBook-Pros-Launching-Tomorrow-With-These-4-New-Features-2.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-921192" /><br/>
Apple has so far adopted an 18-month cycle of M1 to M2, and M2 to M3, so it would be reasonable to assume a 2025 launch for M4 MacBook Pro models if Apple sticks with the same tempo. Incidentally, such a roadmap tallies with rumors of the first MacBook Pro with an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/01/11/touchscreen-macs-report/">OLED display and possibly even a touchscreen</a>. <div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m3/">M3</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/09/m3-macs-still-expected-2024/">Here Are All the M3 Macs Still Expected This Year</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/here-are-all-the-m3-macs-still-expected-this-year.2421520/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

The cheapest MacBook Air deal you'll find this weekend at Best Buy is on the now-discontinued 256GB 13-inch M1 MacBook Air for <a href="https://howl.me/clALl0A1vd6"><strong>&#36;749.99</strong></a>, down from &#36;999.00. If you want a model with a larger display, the 256GB M2 15-inch MacBook Air is priced at <a href="https://howl.me/clwvUhPbHPL"><strong>&#36;999.00</strong></a>, down from &#36;1,299.00. You can also get the 512GB M2 model on sale at <a href="https://howl.me/clwvVizVdRk"><strong>&#36;1,199.00</strong></a>, down from &#36;1,499.00. Across the board these are the best prices we've ever seen on the M1 and M2 MacBook Air.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[The base model 13-inch MacBook Air with the M3 chip, 256GB of storage, and 8GB of RAM has significantly faster SSD speeds compared to the equivalent model with the M2 chip, according to benchmark results <a href="https://youtu.be/4U9nCMV7cv4">shared today by YouTube channel Max Tech</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/Apple-MacBook-Air-2-up-hero-240304-feature.jpg" alt="" width="1960" height="1102" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-939443" /><br/>
Max Tech's teardown video confirms that Apple has returned to using two 128GB storage chips for the new 13-inch MacBook Air with 256GB of storage, compared to a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/07/14/m2-macbook-air-slower-ssd-base-model/">single 256GB chip in the equivalent model with the M2 chip</a>. This change results in faster SSD read and write speeds in tests, as the two chips can process requests in parallel.<br/>
<br/>
Max Tech ran Blackmagic's Disk Speed Test tool with a 5GB file size test on both the M2 and M3 models of the 13-inch MacBook Air with 256GB of storage and 8GB of RAM, and they found the SSD in the M3 model achieved up to 33% faster write speeds and up to 82% faster read speeds compared to the SSD in the M2 model.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4U9nCMV7cv4?si=NjlaHMazuY6enVyM" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><br/>
The change very likely extends to the base model 15-inch MacBook Air with the M3 chip, although Max Tech has yet to tear down that model.<br/>
<br/>
Apple's decision to switch to a single 256GB chip for the base model MacBook Air in 2022 was controversial, even though the slower SSD speeds are unlikely to be noticed by the average MacBook Air user working on common day-to-day tasks. Nevertheless, customers who purchase an M3 model no longer need to worry about configuring the laptop with at least 512GB of storage in order to avoid the slower speeds.<br/>
<br/>

The new MacBook Air models with the M3 chip launched Friday. Apple continues to sell a 13-inch MacBook Air with the M2 chip and 256GB of storage for &#36;999, so customers who want maximum SSD performance should avoid that model.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/">MacBook Air</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#15-MacBook-Air">15" MacBook Air (Buy Now)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Air">13" MacBook Air (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macbook-air.122">MacBook Air</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/09/base-model-m3-macbook-air-faster-ssd/">Base Model M3 MacBook Air Has Faster SSD Speeds After Controversy With Previous Model</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/base-model-m3-macbook-air-has-faster-ssd-speeds-after-controversy-with-previous-model.2421496/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[We heard some last-minute rumblings that an Apple product launch might be coming this week, and indeed it did with the debut of new MacBook Air models based on Apple's M3 chip.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/top-stories-9mar2024.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-940395" /><br/>
Alongside the new MacBook Air, we got the usual spring refresh with new Apple Watch band and iPhone case colors, while this week also saw the release of iOS 17.4 and related operating system updates, so read on below for details on these stories and more!<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Apple Announces New MacBook Air Models With M3 Chip</h2><br/>
Apple this week <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/04/apple-announces-m3-macbook-air/">updated the 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Air with several new features</a>, including the M3 chip for faster performance, Wi-Fi 6E support, expanded external display support, an anti-fingerprint seal on the Midnight finish, and microphone improvements.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/Apple-MacBook-Air-2-up-hero-240304-feature.jpg" alt="" width="1960" height="1102" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-939443" /><br/>
The new MacBook Air models became available to order immediately after the announcement on Monday, with a launch following on Friday, March 8. Apple has <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/04/apple-discontinues-m1-macbook-air/">discontinued the 13-inch MacBook Air with the M1 chip</a> and the 15-inch MacBook Air with the M2 chip as part of this refresh, while the 13-inch MacBook Air with the M2 chip now starts at &#36;999 in the U.S.<br/>
<br/>
The first <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/review/m3-macbook-air/">reviews and unboxing videos for the new MacBook Air</a> were published just ahead of the launch, and we've gone hands-on with the machine ourselves for some early impressions.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>14-Inch MacBook Pro With M3 Chip to Get Multi-Display Support With Software Update</h2><br/>
The new MacBook Air models <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/04/m3-macbook-air-two-displays-lid-closed/">support two external displays when the laptop's lid is closed</a>. Previous models were officially limited to one external display, although DisplayLink adapters allow for more.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/m3-macbook-pro-new-blue.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-940256" /><br/>
Apple has confirmed that the 14-inch MacBook Pro with the M3 chip will <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/04/m3-macbook-pro-multi-display-support/">also gain support for up to two external displays with a software update</a>. As with the MacBook Air, the laptop's lid will need to be closed to use a second display.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Apple Releases iOS 17.4 With EU App Changes, New Emoji, Podcast Transcripts, and More</h2><br/>
Apple this week <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/05/apple-releases-ios-17-4/">released iOS 17.4 for the iPhone</a> following over a month of beta testing.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/iOS-17.4-Feature-Blue.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-932462" /><br/>
iOS 17.4 include major App Store, Safari, and Apple Pay changes in the EU, as a result of the Digital Markets Act. <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/05/apple-releases-ios-17-4/">Other key new features</a> include Apple Podcasts transcripts, an iMessage security upgrade, new emoji, and Apple Cash virtual card numbers. The update also further prepares for the launch of next-generation CarPlay this year.<br/>
<br/>
Later in the week, Apple released macOS Sonoma 14.4, watchOS 10.4, tvOS 17.4, HomePod software 17.4, and visionOS 1.1.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Apple Refreshes iPhone Case and Apple Watch Band Colors</h2><br/>
As it does on a seasonal basis, Apple this week <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/04/apple-refreshes-cases-and-watch-bands/">updated some of the colors available for select iPhone cases and Apple Watch bands</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/3-4-24-iPhone-Case-Refresh-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-939420" /><br/>
For example, Apple's Silicone Case with MagSafe for ‌iPhone‌ is now available in new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/04/apple-refreshes-cases-and-watch-bands/">Soft Mint, Sunshine, Light Blue, and Pink</a> color options.<br/>
<br/>
Apple has yet to announce a new color option for the iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus, and it's unclear if it has any plans to.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>EU Fines Apple &#36;2 Billion for Anti-Competitive Behavior Toward Spotify</h2><br/>
The European Commission this week <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/04/eu-fines-apple-2-billion/">levied a significant fine of nearly &#36;2 billion against Apple</a> due to alleged anti-competitive behavior towards Spotify.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/App-Store-vs-EU-Feature-2.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-932826" /><br/>
In response, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/04/eu-fines-apple-2-billion/">Apple said</a> EU officials failed to "uncover any credible evidence of consumer harm," and said its decision "ignores the realities of a market that is thriving, competitive, and growing fast."<br/>
<br/>
<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/04/spotify-lauds-2-billion-eu-fine-says-apple-has-muzzled-streaming-music-services/">Spotify said</a> the decision "marks an important moment in the fight for a more open internet for consumers."<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Apple to Let EU iPhone Users Delete Safari and More Easily Transition to Android</h2><br/>
Apple already introduced several changes to the App Store and more on iOS 17.4 in the EU, in response to the Digital Markets Act.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/transfer-to-android.jpg" alt="" width="1240" height="698" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-940141" /><br/>
Now, Apple has shared additional plans. For example, the company <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/07/apple-eu-safari-android-changes/">will allow iPhone users in the EU to delete the Safari app</a> and to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/07/apple-eu-safari-android-changes/">more easily transition from an iPhone to an Android smartphone</a>. More specific details about these plans will be released at a later time.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a> is still months away from being unveiled, but there are already several rumors and expectations for the software update, as outlined below.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/iOS-18-Mock-Feature-Baubles.jpg" alt="" width="2250" height="1266" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-909207" /><br/>
iOS 18 is rumored to include new ChatGPT-inspired generative AI features for Siri and many built-in apps, and Apple plans to add RCS support to the Messages app for an improved texting experience between iPhones and Android devices. The update is also rumored to have some design changes, but details remain slim.<br/>
<br/>
iOS 18 is expected to be announced at Apple's annual developers conference WWDC in June, and widely released in September.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Smarter Siri and Generative AI</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/iOS-18-Mock-Siri-Feature-Baubles.jpg" alt="" width="2250" height="1266" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-909208" /><br/>
iOS 18 is rumored to have <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/16/ios-18-slew-of-new-ai-features/">new generative AI features</a> for Siri, Spotlight, Shortcuts, Apple Music, Messages, Health, Numbers, Pages, Keynote, and more, according to sources such as <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman and <em>The Information</em>'s Wayne Ma.<br/>
<br/>
Apple CEO Tim Cook has repeatedly teased that the company is working on generative AI, and plans to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/01/apple-ai-details-coming-later-this-year/">share details "later this year."</a><br/>
<br/>
Generative AI surged in popularity in late 2022, when OpenAI released ChatGPT, a chatbot that can respond to questions and other text prompts. The company has also expanded into generative AI tools for images and videos.<br/>
<br/>
Some generative AI features <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/09/iphone-16-exclusive-ai-features-ios-18/">might be exclusive to iPhone 16 models</a>, which are rumored to have a Neural Engine with <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/14/iphone-16-upgraded-neural-engine-rumor/">"significantly" more cores</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>RCS Support in Messages App</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/07/General-Apps-Messages.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1407" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-808613" /><br/>
In November, Apple announced that it would <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/16/apple-to-adopt-rcs-messaging-standard/">support the cross-platform messaging standard RCS</a> in the Messages app on the iPhone starting "later" in 2024, so it will likely be an iOS 18 feature based on that timeframe.<br/>
<br/>
RCS support should result in the following improvements to the default messaging experience between iPhones and Android devices:<ul><br/>
 <li>Higher-resolution photos and videos</li><br/>
 <li>Audio messages</li><br/>
 <li>Typing indicators</li><br/>
 <li>Read receipts</li><br/>
 <li>Wi-Fi messaging between iPhones and Android devices</li><br/>
 <li>Improved group chats, including the ability for iPhone users to leave a conversation that includes Android users</li></li><br/>
</ul>These modern features are already available for iPhone-to-iPhone conversations with blue bubbles, via iMessage, and many of the features are also available in third-party messaging apps, such as WhatsApp and Telegram. RCS support on the iPhone will extend the features to green bubbles in the Messages app.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Design Changes</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/iOS-Design-1.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-940300" /><br/>
In a February edition of his newsletter, <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman said Apple was working to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/25/ios-18-design-changes-rumors/">update the design of iOS</a> as "early as this year."<br/>
<br/>
Gurman has yet to reveal any specific design changes planned for iOS. In a November edition of his newsletter, however, he said Apple's senior management described iOS 18 as "<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/13/apple-says-ios-18-ambitious-compelling/">ambitious and compelling</a>," with "major new features and designs."<br/>
<br/>
Gurman does not expect iOS 18 to receive a "total overhaul that <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/09/ios-18-visionos-design-elements-rumor/">mirrors visionOS</a>."<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Accessibility Features</h2><br/>
iOS 18 could include <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/07/ios-18-macos-15-accessibility/">new accessibility features related to VoiceOver, Live Speech, and Text Size</a>.<br/>
<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's M3 <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/">MacBook Air</a> models are in stores as of today, so we picked one up to test it out, see what's new, answer reader questions, and determine whether it's worth buying or upgrading to.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qI_HH9zBEEo" title="Apple M3 MacBook Air: Your Questions Answered!" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe><em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/macrumors?sub_confirmation=1">Subscribe to the MacRumors YouTube channel</a> for more videos.</em></div><br/>
The &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; is available in 13.6-inch and 15.3-inch sizes, just like the prior-generation versions. Apple did not introduce notable design changes this time around, so most of what's new is on the inside.<br/>
<br/>
An M3 chip is the main upgrade, and this is the same chip that Apple already used in the 14-inch MacBook Pro. When we benchmarked our test unit with an 8-core GPU and 10-core GPU, we got a Geekbench single-core score of 3106 and a multi-core score of 11690. For comparison's sake, the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m1/">M1</a> &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; scored 2335/8314 and the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m2/">M2</a> &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; scored 2595/9745, so that's a decent boost in CPU performance.<br/>
<br/>
Compared to the &zwnj;M1&zwnj;, single-core M3 performance is up 28 percent, and multi-core performance is up 34 percent. Compared to the &zwnj;M2&zwnj;, both the single-core and multi-core CPU tests came in at 18 percent higher. As for Metal GPU scores, the &zwnj;M1&zwnj; earned a score of 32117, the &zwnj;M2&zwnj; was at 45651, and the M3 was at 46920.<br/>
<br/>
Overall, CPU and GPU performance have improved notably over the &zwnj;M1&zwnj; and more modestly over the &zwnj;M2&zwnj;. It's worth noting that the M3 also has hardware-accelerated ray tracing and mesh shading that are of use for 3D rendering and will eventually make games on the Mac more realistic. AV1 decode should improve streaming from services that support the codec.<br/>
<br/>
There are a couple of other improvements to note, including Wi-Fi 6E support for connecting to 6GHz networks. You might not see too many 6GHz networks just yet, but it's a good future proofing feature if you don't already have a 6E router. The M3 models support two external displays in clamshell mode rather than just one, call clarity is better than before, and there's a new finish on the midnight model to cut down on fingerprints.<br/>
<br/>
Pricing on the 13-inch &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; starts at &#36;1099 and pricing on the 15-inch model starts at &#36;1299. It's not worth upgrading to the new machine if you already have an &zwnj;M2&zwnj; &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; because those machines already have the 2022/2023 design, but if you have an &zwnj;M1&zwnj; or any Intel model and are looking for a new solution, the M3 &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; is worth considering.<br/>
<br/>
In terms of upgrades, if you're just using the &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; for day-to-day tasks like web browsing and email, you don't need to shell out extra money for more memory, a better GPU (13-inch model), or more storage, but if you plan to use it for more system intensive tasks, it's worth looking at some of those upgrades.<br/>
