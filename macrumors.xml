<br/>
<h2>14-inch MacBook Pro</h2><br/>
Amazon has the 8-Core, 512GB M3 14-inch MacBook Pro for <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0CM5JV268%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1"><strong>&#36;1,399.00</strong></a> in Space Gray, down from &#36;1,599.00. This is a match of the all-time low price on this notebook, and right now it's the only 14-inch model that is at a record low price on Amazon.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0CM5JV268%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1"target="_blank"><div class="fancybutton"><div class="fancybadge">&#36;200 OFF</div>14-inch M3 MacBook Pro (512GB) for &#36;1,399.00</div></a></div><br/>
<br/>
If you're looking for more storage, Amazon has the 8-Core, 1TB M3 14-inch MacBook Pro for <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0CM5LZWJ1%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"><strong>&#36;1,649.00</strong></a>, down from &#36;1,799.00. This is a second-best price on the notebook, and Amazon has it available in Silver and Space Gray.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>16-inch MacBook Pro</h2><br/>
For the larger display, Amazon is discounting a few of the higher-end models to all-time low prices. You can get the 14-Core, 36GB RAM, 1TB M3 Max 16-inch MacBook Pro for <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0CM5MF262%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1"><strong>&#36;3,249.99</strong></a> with an on-page coupon, down from &#36;3,499.00. Thanks to the on-page coupon, this is a new record low price for this model, and it's only available in Space Black.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><em><strong>Note: You won't see the deal price until checkout.</strong></em></div><br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0CM5MF262%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1"target="_blank"><div class="fancybutton"><div class="fancybadge">&#36;249 OFF</div>16-inch MacBook Pro (36GB RAM, 1TB, M3 Max) for &#36;3,249.99</div></a></div><br/>
<br/>
Lastly, the 16-Core, 48GB RAM, 1TB M3 Max 16-inch MacBook Pro has hit <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0CM5K7BCR%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"><strong>&#36;3,799.00</strong></a> in Silver, down from &#36;3,999.00. This is another best-ever price on the 16-inch MacBook Pro, but stock has been dwindling on the notebook, so if you're interested be sure to place your order soon.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0CM5K7BCR%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"target="_blank"><div class="fancybutton"><div class="fancybadge">&#36;200 OFF</div>16-inch MacBook Pro (48GB RAM, 1TB, M3 Max) for &#36;3,799.00</div></a></div><br/>

		<description><![CDATA[The United States Supreme Court today <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/orders/courtorders/011624zor_e1pf.pdf">declined to hear</a> separate requests from both Apple and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/epic-games/">Epic Games</a> in their long-standing lawsuit against each other with regards to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a> rules. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/05/app-store-blue-banner-epic-1.jpg" alt="" width="1794" height="1009" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-800065" /><br/>
Apple made the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/28/apple-epic-appeal-supreme-court/">request</a> in September 2023, asking the Supreme Court to hear its appeal about the portion of its legal dispute that was ruled in Epic's favor. This was Apple's so-called "anti-steering" rule that bars developers of many iOS apps from directing users to methods of purchase available outside of the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj;, circumventing Apple's revenue cut.<br/>
<br/>
The Supreme Court also declined to hear a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/27/epic-games-supreme-court/">request from Epic Games</a> to make a ruling on the case. The Supreme Court was the last stop for &zwnj;Epic Games&zwnj; after it lost an appeal earlier this year. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in April 2023 <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/24/epic-games-loses-appeal-app-store-battle/">sided with the lower court</a> and ruled that Apple's &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; rules do not violate antitrust law by not allowing for third-party marketplaces.<br/>
<br/>
The dispute between Apple and Epic <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2020/08/13/apple-removes-fortnite-from-app-store/">dates back to 2020</a> with Epic seeking to overturn Apple's &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; rules requiring content purchases within iOS apps to go through Apple, which takes a 15% to 30% cut of the revenue.<br/>
<br/>
In multiple rounds of the dispute, Apple has won on every count with the exception of just one regarding Apple's "anti-steering" rule. In July 2023, a judge ruled that Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/07/17/app-store-rule-change-epic-games-delayed/">did not have to make changes to its policies</a>.<br/>
<br/>
As a result of the Supreme Court's decision today, the previous rulings stand and Apple is able to continue to disallow third-party payment processing within apps, but will have to allow developers to inform users about other purchasing options outside of the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj;.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/lawsuit/">Apple Lawsuits</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/epic-games/">Epic Games</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/epic-games-vs-apple/">Epic Games vs. Apple</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/16/supreme-court-declines-to-hear-apple-vs-epic-case/">US Supreme Court Declines to Hear Apple vs. Epic Games Case</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/us-supreme-court-declines-to-hear-apple-vs-epic-games-case.2416489/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2024/01/apple-previews-new-entertainment-experiences-launching-with-apple-vision-pro/">listed</a> some streaming, video, and sports apps that will be available on the Vision Pro when the headset <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/08/apple-announces-february-2-vision-pro-launch/">launches on February 2</a>, including Disney+, ESPN, MLB, PGA Tour, Max, Discovery+, Amazon Prime Video, Paramount+, Peacock, Pluto TV, Tubi, Fubo, Crunchyroll, Red Bull TV, IMAX, TikTok, and MUBI. Major League Soccer fans can also access MLS Season Pass through the Apple TV app on the headset.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/Disney-Plus-Vision-Pro-1.jpg" alt="" width="1960" height="1102" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-930910" /><br/>
In addition to apps, users will be able to access many other streaming services using Safari and other web browsers on the headset.<br/>
<br/>
Vision Pro supports both 2D and 3D movies. Apple said Disney+ and several other streaming apps will offer select movies in 3D on the Vision Pro at launch, and will debut 3D versions of new movies alongside or shortly after 2D releases.<br/>
<br/>
At launch, more than 150 3D movies will be available to buy or rent through the Apple TV app on the Vision Pro, such as <em>Avatar: The Way of Water</em>, <em>Dune</em>, <em>Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse</em>, and <em>The Super Mario Bros. Movie</em>.<br/>
<br/>

In addition, the Apple TV app will offer a <a href="https://www.apple.com/tv-pr/news/2024/01/apple-tv-unveils-groundbreaking-immersive-originals-from-todays-biggest-storytellers-set-to-debut-on-apple-vision-pro/">selection of content</a> recorded in the new Apple Immersive Video format at no additional cost. Apple says the format consists of 180-degree 3D 8K recordings captured with spatial audio. <br/>
<br/>
That immersive content includes:<blockquote>- <strong>Alicia Keys: Rehearsal Room</strong> offers a rare glimpse into the Grammy winner's creative process with this intimate rehearsal session featuring renditions of her hits "No One," "If I Ain't Got You," and "You Don't Know My Name." Users can also access these performances as a special EP exclusively on Apple Music when it debuts.<br/>
<br/>
- <strong>Adventure</strong> follows pioneering athletes as they take on awe-inspiring challenges in some of the world's most sensational locations. In the first episode, Highlining, viewers step into thin air with highliner Faith Dickey as she takes on her biggest challenge yet: a daring traverse 3,000 feet above Norway's breathtaking fjords.<br/>
<br/>
- <strong>Wild Life</strong> takes viewers up close and personal with some of the most charismatic creatures on the planet to uncover what makes them unique, featuring the experts who know them best. The first episode brings viewers into the world's largest rhinoceros sanctuary where a former police captain has dedicated her life to rescuing, raising, and rewilding these gentle giants.<br/>
<br/>
- <strong>Prehistoric Planet Immersive:</strong> The award-winning Apple Original docuseries from Jon Favreau and the producers of Planet Earth returns with an immersive film that transports viewers into the daily lives of dinosaurs, and follows the struggles and triumphs of these majestic animals amid spectacular scenery. Prehistoric Planet Immersive whisks viewers along a rugged ocean coast where a pterosaur colony settles in for an afternoon nap, which proves to be anything but restful.</blockquote>Vision Pro starts at &#36;3,499 in the U.S., and it will be available to pre-order starting this Friday, January 19. The headset is launching in the U.S. only for now, with availability expected to expand to additional countries <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/16/vision-pro-to-launch-internationally-before-wwdc/">later this year</a>.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-vision-pro.209">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/16/vision-pro-streaming-services-and-sports-apps/">Apple Announces Streaming Services and Sports Apps Available on Vision Pro at Launch</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-announces-streaming-services-and-sports-apps-available-on-vision-pro-at-launch.2416486/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple is likely to launch its Vision Pro headset outside the United States before WWDC 2024, analyst <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/">Ming-Chi Kuo</a> today reports.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/Apple-Vision-Pro-Dual-Loop-Band-Teal-Feature-2.jpg" alt="" width="1960" height="1102" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-929939" /><br/>
In a new <a href="https://medium.com/@mingchikuo/apple-is-likely-to-release-vision-pro-outside-the-u-s-d8d2ed8f5f01">post on Medium</a>, Kuo said that Apple plans to share new details about <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/visionos/">visionOS</a> with developers from around the globe at its 2024 Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC). To make this push toward global developers worthwhile, Apple needs to make the Vision Pro available in non-U.S. markets before the event. Making the headset available internationally before WWDC would apparently enable Apple to promote a "global development ecosystem" for &zwnj;visionOS&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
Kuo explained that Apple's reasoning for keeping sales of the Vision Pro exclusive to the United States at first is due to limited supply, a wish to ensure that the sales process goes smoothly before expanding it, and to provide time to modify its software to be suitable for other countries. Once these issues have been resolved, Kuo believes the Vision Pro will go on sale in more countries.<br/>
<br/>
Apple has hosted WWDC in early June every year since 2007, so it is highly likely to fall at the same time again this year. Earlier this month, <em>Bloomberg</em>'s <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a> said that the launch of Vision Pro in other countries around the world <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/07/gurman-vision-pro-launch-imminent/">will not "actually be that much later"</a> than its release in the United States. Apple is said to be considering the United Kingdom, Canada, and China as the next markets to receive the product.<br/>
<br/>
It is not clear how much supply will be available in the rest of the world by the time the Vision Pro goes on sale outside the United States. With <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/11/kuo-vision-pro-sellout-likely/">only 80,000 units</a> expected to be available upon launch in the U.S., the headset is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/09/kuo-apple-vision-pro-may-sell-out-fast/">expected to sell out quickly</a> and thereafter be subject to long shipping delays.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/">Ming-Chi Kuo</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-vision-pro.209">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/16/vision-pro-to-launch-internationally-before-wwdc/">Kuo: Apple Vision Pro to Launch Internationally Before WWDC 2024</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/kuo-apple-vision-pro-to-launch-internationally-before-wwdc-2024.2416482/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple in 2023 <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/30/everything-apple-announced-october-2023-event/">launched</a> an M3-powered 24-inch <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/">iMac</a>, as well as new 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models with M3 series chips. But the rest of Apple's Mac lineup is still to be updated to the latest M3 processors.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/When-Will-Apple-Launch-More-M3-Macs-Feature-Sans-13inch-MBP.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-920524" /><br/>
Now that 2023 is over, attention naturally turns to the other Macs in the company's lineup and where they fit into Apple's M3 roadmap for the year ahead. Here's what the latest rumors say.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>M3 MacBook Air</h2><br/>
Apple sells three versions of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/">MacBook Air</a>: A cheaper previous-generation 13-inch model with <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m1/">M1</a> chip, and 13-inch and 15-inch models equipped with the newer <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m2/">M2</a> chip. The question is, when will Apple discontinue the &zwnj;M1&zwnj; &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; and replace its top-of-the-line 13-inch and 15-inch machines with M3 equivalents?<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/M3-MacBook-Air-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-920517" /><br/>
<br/>
The existing 15-inch &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; arrived in June 2023, which is not that long ago in terms of Mac update cycles. However, Apple released the &zwnj;M2&zwnj; 13-inch ‌&zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; back in June 2022. It is now the oldest Mac in Apple's current crop, having not been updated in over 550 days.<br/>
<br/>
According to <em>Bloomberg</em>'s <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a>, Apple has new M3 &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; models in development that are scheduled for release in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/06/macbook-air-march-2024/">March this year</a>. In October it was reported that both models had passed <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/16/four-new-macbooks-on-schedule-for-launch-in-2024/">engineering verification testing (EVT)</a>, an early production testing phase on prototype devices. The M3 chip used in the Airs is expected to have similar CPU and GPU core counts as the &zwnj;M2&zwnj; chip in the current models.<br/>
<br/>
According to Gurman, Apple is developing the Macs alongside macOS 14.3, an update that is expected between the end of January and February, but new hardware may ship around the March timeframe. The new ‌&zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj;‌ models could be timed to launch alongside updated <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/">iPad Air</a> models, which are coming around March.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Mac Mini</h2><br/>
Apple announced &zwnj;M2&zwnj; and &zwnj;M2&zwnj; Pro <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-mini/">Mac mini</a> models in January, which at the time of writing is just over 360 days ago, but Apple could be already testing an M3 &zwnj;Mac mini&zwnj;, according to Gurman.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/M3-Mac-Mini-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-920522" /><br/>
<br/>
In August, signs of an unknown "15,12" Mac machine were <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/07/apple-testing-mac-mini-m3/">found in developer code</a>, with the Mac featuring an 8-core CPU (consisting of four efficiency cores and four performance cores), 10-core GPU, and 24GB RAM. Based on the similar specifications to the base &zwnj;M2&zwnj; &zwnj;Mac mini&zwnj; (bar the existing model's 8GB RAM as standard), Gurman believes it represents a next-generation &zwnj;Mac mini&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
Gurman <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/07/23/new-macbook-pro-and-mac-mini-with-m3-2024-launch/">previously said</a> he was not expecting an M3 version of the &zwnj;Mac mini&zwnj; to launch until late 2024, but as it is already in testing, it could potentially be unveiled sooner.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Mac Studio, Mac Pro</h2><br/>
Apple updated the ‌<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-studio/">Mac Studio</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-pro/">Mac Pro</a> with &zwnj;M2&zwnj; series chips in June 2023. &zwnj;Mac Studio&zwnj; models come with either the &zwnj;M2&zwnj; Max or &zwnj;M2&zwnj; Ultra chip, while the &zwnj;Mac Pro&zwnj; has adopted the &zwnj;M2&zwnj; Ultra.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/M3-Mac-Pro-and-Studio-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-920519" /><br/>
<br/>
Both Macs are considered to be in the middle of their product cycles, and Gurman <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/07/apple-working-on-new-mac-studio-and-mac-pro/">believes</a> Apple is working on a new &zwnj;Mac Studio&zwnj; that is likely to launch in the second half of 2024.<br/>
<br/>
The next ‌&zwnj;Mac Studio&zwnj;‌ is likely to be offered with the as-yet-unannounced fourth variant of the M3 chip. Like previous generations, this will double the components of the "Max" version, meaning that it will feature up to 32 CPU cores and 80 GPU cores. Gurman says that Apple is also likely to refresh the &zwnj;Mac Pro&zwnj; with this new high-end chip. <br/>
<br/>
Taiwanese research firm TrendForce claims that Apple will launch a new ‌&zwnj;Mac Studio&zwnj;‌ featuring the M3 Ultra chip at WWDC in June, so we could well see the new &zwnj;Mac Pro&zwnj; alongside of it. <br/>
<br/>
<h2>13-inch MacBook Pro</h2><br/>
Apple has <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/30/apple-discontinues-13-inch-macbook-pro/">discontinued</a> the 13-inch &zwnj;M2&zwnj; MacBook Pro – and along with it the Touch Bar – replacing it with a 14-inch model that's equipped with a next-generation M3 chip. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/No-M3-MacBook-Pro-13-Inch-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-920518" /><br/>
<br/>
Apple says that the 14-inch M3 MacBook Pro is up to 60 percent faster than the 13-inch MacBook Pro with &zwnj;M1&zwnj;. The M3 14-inch MacBook Pro also comes with a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/01/m3-macbook-pro-comparison/">number of other benefits</a> that make it worth the upgrade for anyone with the original 13-inch machine. So do not expect to see an M3-powered 13-inch MacBook Pro anytime soon, if ever.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>M3 Chip Speed and Performance Gains</h2><br/>
The M3 series of chips are built on TSMC's 3-nanometer process, bringing performance and efficiency improvements over Apple's previous &zwnj;M2&zwnj; chips, which are based on the earlier-generation 5-nanometer process. Since its transition to Intel chips, Apple's strategy has been as follows. <br/>
<br/>
In the &zwnj;M1&zwnj; and &zwnj;M2&zwnj; series of Apple silicon, each generation has a baseline version, then a "Pro" chip with more cores for its central processing unit and graphics. Next is an even more powerful "Max" version that doubles the number of graphics cores. Lastly, an "Ultra" model doubles the number of main processing cores and graphics cores found in the "Max." Things are slightly different with the M3 series, as explained below.<br/>
<br/>
In terms of the actual real-world gains, this of course depends on the M3 processor version, coupled with the particular Mac model and other component factors like RAM and thermal dissipation. Nevertheless, all of Apple's M3 chips also boast GPU improvements not found in the &zwnj;M2&zwnj; series, including Dynamic Caching, hardware-accelerated ray tracing, and hardware-accelerated mesh shading.<br/>
<br/>
<h3>M3</h3><br/>
Apple's base M3 chip will likely feature in future &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; models, as well as an updated lower-end version of the &zwnj;Mac mini&zwnj;. At least in the MacBook Airs, the M3 chip is expected to have similar CPU and GPU core counts as the &zwnj;M2&zwnj; chip in the current models, but that could be true for the &zwnj;Mac mini&zwnj; as well.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/M3-Chip-Apple-Event-Slide.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="898" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-920110" /><br/>
Based on Geekbench benchmarks, the M3 chip has single-core and multi-core scores of around 3,000 and 11,700, respectively. The standard &zwnj;M2&zwnj; chip has single-core and multi-core scores of around 2,600 and 9,700, respectively, so the M3 chip is up to 20% faster than the &zwnj;M2&zwnj; chip, which is what Apple claimed during its "Scary Fast" event in October.<br/>
<br/>
<h3>M3 Pro</h3><br/>
Going on what we know from the recently released 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro M3 models, the M3 Pro chip outperforms the ‌&zwnj;M2&zwnj;‌ Pro, but not by a lot. Based on Geekbench benchmarks, single-core speed is up around 16.7 percent, while multi-core speed is up approximately 6.7 percent. For context, the M3 Pro has 150GB/s memory bandwidth, while the &zwnj;M2&zwnj; Pro had 200GB/s. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/m3-pro-chip.jpg" alt="" width="5104" height="2868" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-919649" /><br/>
<br/>
The M3 Pro and &zwnj;M2&zwnj; Pro chips in the 16-inch MacBook Pro have 12 CPU cores, but the &zwnj;M2&zwnj; Pro actually featured one additional GPU core over the M3 Pro. Despite that, Apple claims it is 10 percent faster than the &zwnj;M2&zwnj; Pro GPU and 40 percent faster than the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m1-pro/">M1 Pro</a> GPU. <br/>
<br/>
<h3>M3 Max</h3><br/>
With the M3 series, Apple deviated slightly from the doubling strategy it followed with the &zwnj;M2&zwnj; Max by adding several more CPU cores to the M3 Max compared to the M3 Pro. Benchmarks indicate that Apple's M3 Max chip in the 16-inch MacBook Pro is around as fast as the &zwnj;M2&zwnj; Ultra chip used in the current-generation &zwnj;Mac Pro&zwnj; and the higher-end &zwnj;Mac Studio&zwnj;. In other words, the &zwnj;M2&zwnj; Ultra &zwnj;Mac Pro&zwnj; is outperformed by what is on paper a lower-end machine, just four months after it was released.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/M3-Max-Chip.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="895" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-920348" /><br/>
Note that the M3-powered 16-inch MacBook Pro starts at &#36;3,499 in the U.S. when configured with the M3 Max chip, while the &zwnj;Mac Studio&zwnj; with the &zwnj;M2&zwnj; Ultra chip starts at &#36;3,999, so you can effectively get the same performance for &#36;500 less by buying a 16-inch MacBook Pro, which also includes display, keyboard, and trackpad. <br/>
<br/>
Will this performance imbalance alone encourage Apple to bring forward the launch of M3-powered &zwnj;Mac Studio&zwnj; and &zwnj;Mac Pro&zwnj; models? Unlikely. But we can always hope. <br/>
<br/>
<h3>M3 Ultra</h3><br/>
Having not yet been announced, the M3 Ultra chip is something of an unknown quantity. The existing &zwnj;M2&zwnj; Ultra encompasses two &zwnj;M2&zwnj; Max chips for double overall CPU and GPU performance, as well as twice the memory bandwidth (800GB/s), so it would seem safe to expect Apple to follow the same strategy as it did with the M3 Ultra, with similar performance gains over the M3 Max from Apple's next-generation high-end M3 Ultra chip.<br/>
<br/>
In a small deviation, Apple did add several more CPU cores to the M3 Max compared to the M3 Pro. However, if Apple continues to double both the CPU and graphics configurations with the Ultra, the M3 Ultra could end up having 32 CPU cores and 80 graphics cores. <div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m3/">M3</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/16/here-are-all-the-new-m3-apple-macs-expected-in-2024/">Here Are All the New M3 Apple Macs Expected This Year</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/here-are-all-the-new-m3-apple-macs-expected-this-year.2416465/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple overtook Samsung as the top global smartphone manufacturer in 2023, according to preliminary data from <a href="https://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=prUS51776424">market research firm IDC</a>. If the data is accurate, it is the first time Samsung has lost the top spot to another company in 13 years. In 2013, Nokia held the number one spot, Samsung was second, and Apple didn't even feature in the top five.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/11/iphone-14-cyber.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-875270" /><br/>
IDC bases its analyses on market share of global smartphone shipments across the year. According to the report, Apple took a 20.1% market share, while Samsung took 19.4% of the share. <br/>
<br/>
Apple was also the only company in the top three to achieve positive growth year-on-year, increasing shipments from 226.3 million units to 234.6 million units.<br/>
<blockquote>"While we saw some strong growth from low-end Android players like Transsion and Xiaomi in the second half of 2023, stemming from rapid growth in emerging markets, the biggest winner is clearly Apple," said Nabila Popal, research director with IDC's Worldwide Tracker team. "Not only is Apple the only player in the Top 3 to show positive growth annually, but also bags the number 1 spot annually for the first time ever. All this despite facing increased regulatory challenges and renewed competition from Huawei in China, its largest market."</blockquote>Samsung's drop in rank is interpreted as only partly down to strong sales of Apple's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-14/">iPhone 14</a> models and the company's debut of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a> series, while diversification in the Android market is also said to be a factor. Other impacting variables are said to include Huawei's resurgence in China, and brands like OnePlus, Honor, Google, and others launching competitive devices in the lower price range of the high-end market. <br/>
<br/>

Overall, the smartphone market declined by 3.2% to 1.17 billion units shipped across the year, driven largely by macroeconomic challenges and elevated inventory early in the year. However, a growth spurt in the latter stages of 2023 suggests the market could see a recovery this year, with foldable devices and increased interest in AI capabilities also said to be gaining traction.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/idc/">IDC</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/16/apple-top-spot-global-smartphone-shipments/">Apple Ships More Smartphones Annually Than Samsung for First Time</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-ships-more-smartphones-annually-than-samsung-for-first-time.2416460/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[OLED displays for both of Apple's next-generation iPad Pro models will have entered the production phase by this week in time for device shipments to begin in April, claims a new report by <em><a href="https://www.thelec.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=25343">The Elec</a></em>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/07/iPad-Pro-OLED-Feature-2.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-853666" /><br/>
According to the Korean-language outlet, LG Display recently began manufacturing the thin film transistor (TFT) for the new 13-inch iPad Pro displays, while Samsung will this week similarly kickstart its own TFT production for the new 11-inch iPad Pro. The TFT essentially acts as a switch to turn off and turn on individual OLED pixels.<br/>
<br/>
Finished 11-inch and 13-inch OLED iPad Pro models are expected to go into mass production around March, in time for a scheduled release in April, according to today's report. Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo has said he expects the new ‌iPad Pro‌ models to launch in the second quarter of 2024, which runs from April to June. <br/>
<br/>
The timeframe given by <em>The Elec</em> also dovetails with an earlier <em>Bloomberg</em> report that <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/06/ipad-air-ipad-pro-2024-refresh/">claimed</a> the new iPad Pro models could be announced at a March event, along with a new iPad Air that will be available in two sizes for the first time. Apple usually opens pre-orders during an event or a week or two after it, and then begins delivering the devices to customers the following week.<br/>
<br/>
OLED displays are a first for the ‌iPad‌ lineup. Apple has been using OLED technology for the iPhone and the Apple Watch, but larger OLED screens are more expensive. Compared to LED or mini-LED, OLED brings deeper blacks and more vivid colors. <br/>
<br/>
Apple's OLED iPad Pro shipments forecast for the year have reportedly decreased to 8 million units, down from the 10 million units that were projected for 2024 last year. The reduction is said to be a reflection of broadly sluggish performance across Apple's product lineup. Apple did not release any new iPad models last year, so it will be interesting to see if pent-up demand can offset poor sales.<br/>
<ul><li><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/08/oled-ipad-prices-to-start-1500-dollars/">OLED iPad Pros Could Start From &#36;1,500, Rising to as Much as &#36;2,000</a></li></ul><br/>
Along with new displays, the ‌iPad Pro‌ models are expected to be powered by Apple's latest M3 chip, which debuted in new MacBook Pro models last year. The M3 is built on 3-nanometer technology, and should bring a notable graphics improvement over the M2 chip that is currently used in the ‌iPad Pro‌.<br/>
<br/>
The displays are expected to be three times the price of those used in iPhones, which could translate to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/08/oled-ipad-prices-to-start-1500-dollars/">much higher prices for customers</a>. Apple is also rumored to be releasing a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/03/gurman-new-ipad-magic-keyboard-to-feature-aluminum/">redesigned Magic Keyboard accessory</a> for the devices, since the screens will be slightly larger and the tablets themselves could be slightly thinner.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/theelec-kr/">The Elec</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/oled-ipad-pro/">OLED iPad Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#11-iPad-Pro">11" iPad Pro (Don't Buy)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#12-9-iPad-Pro">12.9" iPad Pro (Don't Buy)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipad.137">iPad</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/16/oled-ipad-displays-enter-production/">OLED iPad Pro Displays Now in Production, Devices to Ship in April</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/oled-ipad-pro-displays-now-in-production-devices-to-ship-in-april.2416456/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple has readied modified Apple Watch models that "do not contain pulse oximetry functionality," medical technology company Masimo said in a <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/699113770/Apple-Masimo-Notice-of-Supplemental-Authority">document filed today</a> with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/09/apple-watch-series-6-blood-oxygen-monitoring-1.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="897" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-759072" /><br/>
The filing, viewed by <em>MacRumors</em>, suggests that Apple will be removing the Blood Oxygen app from new Apple Watch Series 9 and Apple Watch Ultra 2 models sold in the U.S., at least temporarily. This change would allow Apple to sidestep an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/26/apple-watch-import-ban-official/">import and sales ban on Apple Watch models with blood oxygen sensing</a>, which the U.S. International Trade Commission <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/27/us-trade-tribunal-apple-watch-ban-masimo/">ordered last year</a> after ruling that Apple violated Masimo's pulse oximetry patents. The ban was <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/27/apple-watch-series-9-and-ultra-2-sales-ban-paused/">already temporarily paused</a> shortly after it began last month, but it could have resumed as early as this month, which likely spurred Apple to take this measure.<br/>
<br/>
Apple has started shipping modified Apple Watch models to retail stores in the U.S., according to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-01-15/apple-to-remove-watch-blood-oxygen-app-to-avoid-ban-masimo-says"><em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman</a>, but it's unclear when they will go on sale. Apple has yet to respond to our request for comment.<br/>
<br/>
Apple's website still advertises the Blood Oxygen app as an available feature on the Series 9 and Ultra 2 order pages in the U.S. as of writing. The feature can measure and display your body's blood oxygen percentage, and is intended for "wellness purposes only." Existing owners of the Series 9 and Ultra 2 will likely retain access to the feature, and it is not expected to be removed on models sold in other countries.<br/>
<br/>
The feature's removal is likely a stopgap, as Gurman reported that Apple is preparing a software update that would adjust the Blood Oxygen app's algorithms, in an attempt to avoid Masimo's patented technology. It's unclear if this effort will be successful, and the legal battle between Apple and Masimo is likely far from over.<br/>
<br/>
"Apple's claim that its redesigned watch does not contain pulse oximetry is a positive step toward accountability," a Masimo spokesperson told <em>MacRumors</em>. "It is especially important that one of the world's largest and most powerful companies respects the intellectual property rights of smaller companies and complies with ITC orders when it is caught infringing."<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch/">Apple Watch Series 9</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch-ultra/">Apple Watch Ultra 2</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/masimo/">Masimo</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch">Apple Watch (Neutral)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch_Ultra">Apple Watch Ultra (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-watch.172">Apple Watch</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/15/apple-watch-blood-oxygen-app-removal/">Apple May Sell Series 9 and Ultra 2 Watches Without Blood Oxygen App in U.S. Amid Patent Dispute</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-may-sell-series-9-and-ultra-2-watches-without-blood-oxygen-app-in-u-s-amid-patent-dispute.2416413/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple is preparing to split the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a> "in two" in the coming weeks ahead of European Union requirements that will force Apple to enable app sideloading in the region, <em>Bloomberg</em>'s <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a> reports.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/01/iOS-App-Store-General-Feature-Desaturated.jpg" alt="" width="2250" height="1266" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-833991" /><br/>
In the latest edition of his <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-01-14/how-to-buy-apple-vision-pro-3-499-device-to-go-on-sale-feb-2-lrdjtdm7">"Power On" newsletter</a>, Gurman explained that Apple is gearing up to make changes to the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; in the EU to comply with the region's impending Digital Markets Act (DMA). Apple is apparently planning to roll out adjustments to comply with the new legal requirements in the coming weeks, including splitting off the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; in the EU from the rest of the world. The deadline for Apple to comply with the DMA is March 7, so the company has just over seven weeks to enact the changes.<br/>
<br/>
Last week, Apple CEO <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tim-cook/">Tim Cook</a> met the European Union's antitrust chief, Margrethe Vestager, at <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-park/">Apple Park</a>. Vestager <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/12/tim-cook-meets-eu-antitrust-chief/">reminded Cook</a> of Apple's impending obligation to allow users to install third-party app stores and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/17/app-sideloading-support-coming-ios-17/">sideload apps</a> under the DMA. Apple will also be obliged to give developers the ability to promote their offers outside the ‌‌‌&zwnj;App Store&zwnj;‌‌‌ and use third-party payment systems. The DMA is expected to force Apple to make a range of significant changes to the way the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj;, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/facetime/">FaceTime</a>, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a> work in Europe.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/bloomberg-com/">Bloomberg</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/european-union/">European Union</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/antitrust/">Apple Antitrust</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/15/app-store-to-be-split-in-two/">App Store to Be &#039;Split in Two&#039; Ahead of EU iPhone Sideloading Deadline</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/app-store-to-be-split-in-two-ahead-of-eu-iphone-sideloading-deadline.2416395/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[You'll soon be able to watch your favorite HBO shows on the Vision Pro, as streaming service Max will be available on Apple's mixed reality headset at launch. Formerly known as HBO Max, the service also offers content from CNN, the DC Universe, the Discovery Channel, the Food Network, HGTV, TBS, TLC, TNT, and more. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/Max-Formerly-HBO-Max.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="563" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-930755" /><br/>
Apple last week confirmed that Max would be one of the entertainment options available on the Vision Pro, along with Apple TV+ and Disney+.<br/>
<br/>
"Apple Vision Pro features ultra-high-resolution displays that deliver more pixels than a 4K TV for each eye, enabling users to watch movies and TV shows from Apple TV+, Disney+, Max, and other services on a screen that feels 100 feet wide with support for HDR content,"  said Apple, in a <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2024/01/apple-vision-pro-available-in-the-us-on-february-2/">press release</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Max will natively support the visionOS operating system, allowing it to take full advantage of the Vision Pro's immersive capabilities. However, the exact design and functionality of the app remains to be seen.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/Disney-Plus-Vision-Pro.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-930759" /><br/>
Disney CEO Bob Iger last year said Disney+ would also be available on the Vision Pro at launch, promising "deeply personal experiences." Its app will also natively support visionOS, and it will be prominently featured in the App Store on the Vision Pro.<br/>
<br/>
Some other streaming services will likely be available on the Vision Pro at launch, but not all will natively support visionOS. For example, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2023-07-23/apple-vision-pro-will-developers-sell-visionos-apps-for-the-3-499-device-lkfg5b1l"><em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman said</a> Netflix will simply offer its iPadOS app on visionOS without any modifications, at least to start. Apple said the Vision Pro is compatible with over one million iOS and iPadOS apps.<br/>
<br/>
Vision Pro pre-orders begin in the U.S. this Friday, January 19 at 5 a.m. Pacific Time, and the headset <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/08/apple-announces-february-2-vision-pro-launch/">launches on Friday, February 2</a>.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/visionos/">visionOS</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-vision-pro.209">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/15/hbo-max-apple-vision-pro/">HBO&#039;s Max Streaming Service to Natively Support Vision Pro at Launch</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/hbos-max-streaming-service-to-natively-support-vision-pro-at-launch.2416387/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Next-generation 2nm chip technology destined for future Apple devices is on schedule to begin production next year, <a href="https://www.digitimes.com/news/a20240115PD215.html"><em>DigiTimes</em></a> reports.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/10/Apple-Silicon-Teal-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-767478" /><br/>
TSMC chip fabrication facilities will begin installing equipment designed for 2nm chip production in April at the earliest. Apple was the first company to utilize TSMC's initial <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/3nm/">3nm</a> technology with the A17 Pro chip in the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a> and &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; Max, and the company is likely to follow suit with the chipmaker's 2nm chips. With production set to begin in 2025, 2nm chips are likely to make their first appearance in Apple devices soon after.<br/>
<br/>
Last month, the <em>Financial Times</em> reported that TSMC had <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/12/tsmc-demos-next-gen-chip-technology/">already demonstrated</a> prototype 2nm chips to Apple ahead of their expected introduction in 2025. Apple is said to be closely aligned with TSMC in the race to develop and implement 2nm chip technology, which will surpass their current &zwnj;3nm&zwnj; chips and associated nodes in terms of transistor density, performance, and efficiency.<br/>
<br/>
Today, <em><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/digitimes-com/">DigiTimes</a></em> added that the chip supplier is also believed to be evaluating which of its plants will be the first to produce even <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/14/tsmc-mentions-highly-advanced-1-4nm-chips/">more advanced 1.4nm chips</a> in 2027. The company began mass production of its enhanced &zwnj;3nm&zwnj; node, which is likely to appear in Apple devices for the first time later this year, in the fourth quarter of 2023.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tsmc/">TSMC</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/digitimes-com/">DigiTimes</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-silicon/">Apple Silicon</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/15/next-gen-chip-technology-on-track-for-2025/">Next-Gen Apple Chip Technology on Track to Reach Production in 2025</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/next-gen-apple-chip-technology-on-track-to-reach-production-in-2025.2416379/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's iPhone 15 Pro Max will continue to be the best-selling iPhone model in the first half of this year, according to Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/iPhone-15-Pro-Cameras.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-913544" /><br/>
Writing in his <a href="https://medium.com/@mingchikuo/大立光罕見正向看待淡季高階鏡頭需求之深度分析-玻塑混合鏡頭-華為歸來與鏡頭單價上漲-以及ai手機成為samsung-s24-高階手機新賣點-in-depth-analysis-of-8e71324d080b">latest industry note on Medium</a>, Kuo said the iPhone 15 Pro Max "will still account for 40–45% of all iPhone 15 shipments in 1H24," which will be "critical" to Taiwanese camera lens supplier Largan's buoyant off-season in the first half of the year.<br/>
<br/>
Apart from being the premium model with the largest display at 6.7-inches, the iPhone 15 Pro Max also features a 5x Telephoto zoom or "tetraprism" lens that is not found in other models. The tetraprism lens in the Pro Max model alone is expected to increase Largan's first half-year revenue by &#36;108.8 to &#36;121.6 million, according to Kuo. <br/>
<br/>
Kuo has repeatedly said he expects the tetraprism lens to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/18/iphone-16-pro-tetraprism-lens-rumor/">expand</a> to both the iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max later this year, enabling at least 5x optical zoom and 25x digital zoom on the Telephoto lens of both premium models. <br/>
<br/>
The iPhone 16 Pro is expected to feature a larger 6.3-inch display, compared to the 6.1-inch iPhone 15 Pro. This change would increase the overall size of the device, which would provide additional internal space for a tetraprism lens.<br/>
<br/>
According to a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/01/both-iphone-16-pro-models-tetraprism-zoom-lens/">report</a> by <em>The Elec</em>, Apple will add LG Innotek as another supplier of the folded zoom module used in the technology, in an attempt to secure production yields for the increased number of units required.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/">Ming-Chi Kuo</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-15-Pro">iPhone 15 Pro (Neutral)</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/15/iphone-15-pro-max-best-seller-early-2024/">Kuo: iPhone 15 Pro Max to Remain Best-Selling Model in Early 2024</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/kuo-iphone-15-pro-max-to-remain-best-selling-model-in-early-2024.2416372/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<title>Apple Vision Pro M2 Chip Said to Have 10 GPU, 8 CPU Cores</title>

		<description><![CDATA[The Apple Vision Pro runs on an M2 chip equipped with ten GPU cores and eight CPU cores – the same version used in Apple's higher-end MacBook Air models. That's according to a <a href="https://x.com/markgurman/status/1746585308626612655?s=20">post on X</a> (formerly Twitter) by <em>Bloomberg</em> reporter Mark Gurman.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/apple-vision-pro-setup.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-923100" /><br/>
Apple revealed early on that its mixed reality headset uses an M2 processor, but it wasn't clear until now which variant of the chip Apple had chosen. <br/>
<br/>
Apple uses the M2 chip in both of its current 13.6- and 15.3-inch MacBook Air models, which launched in June 2022. Built on 5-nanometer technology, the M2 has an 8-core CPU, much like the M1, but it supports eight or ten GPU cores, up from seven or eight in the M1.<br/>
<br/>
As things stand, Apple's &#36;3,499 Vision Pro will launch on February 2 with what is officially a last-generation processor, given that Apple has since released 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models powered by M3 chips. <br/>
<br/>
The M2 chip in Vision Pro is responsible for processing content, running the visionOS operating system, executing computer vision algorithms, and providing graphical content. However, it does not work alone.<br/>
<br/>
Vision Pro offloads the processing of information coming from the cameras, sensors, and microphones to a dedicated custom-built R1 chip. Apple says that it can stream images to the displays within 12 milliseconds, providing a "virtually lag-free" view of the world.<br/>
<br/>
The entry-level Vision Pro is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/09/apple-vision-pro-how-much-ram-and-storage/">equipped</a> 16GB of RAM and 256GB of storage space. Apple could offer models with up to 1TB of storage, but the existence of bigger capacities has not yet been confirmed.<br/>
<br/>
In the <a href="https://x.com/markgurman/status/1746585308626612655?s=20">same post on X</a>, Gurman additionally confirmed that Apple customers will be able to purchase the Vision Pro online and at retail stores using Apple Card installments. Typically, Apple Card installments let customers spread the purchase over monthly payments with no interest. iPhone purchases can be made over 24 monthly payments, for example. Apple Vision Pro pre-orders open on Friday, January 19 at 5.00 a.m. PST in the United States.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-vision-pro.209">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/15/vision-pro-m2-chip-10-gpu-8-cpu-cores/">Apple Vision Pro M2 Chip Said to Have 10 GPU, 8 CPU Cores</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-vision-pro-m2-chip-said-to-have-10-gpu-8-cpu-cores.2416370/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<title>Apple Vision Pro Virtual Keyboard Blasted As &#039;Complete Write-Off&#039;</title>

		<description><![CDATA[Anyone paying attention to Apple's Vision Pro headset unveiling at WWDC 2023 will have seen its virtual keyboard demo. The keyboard floats in mid-air, allowing you to input text in your spatial computing environment while wearing the device. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/apple-vision-pro-virtual-keyboard.jpg" alt="" width="1278" height="720" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-930653" /><br/>
However, anyone planning to ditch their physical keyboard may want to hold onto it for a little while longer: According to <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman, the virtual keyboard experience in visionOS 1.0 is "a complete write-off," and most people will want to use a Bluetooth keyboard instead.<br/>
<blockquote>"The Vision Pro virtual keyboard is a complete write-off at least in 1.0," wrote Gurman in an <a href="https://x.com/markgurman/status/1745907431564063208?s=20">X post</a>. "You have to poke each key one finger at a time like you did before you learned how to type. There is no magical in-air typing. You can also look at a character and pinch. You'll want a Bluetooth keyboard."</blockquote><a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2023/10073/">According to Apple</a>, the buttons on the virtual keyboard are raised above the platter to mimic the affordance of pushing physical keys, and the keyboard even includes feedback via spatial sound effects to "compensate for the missing tactile information." <br/>
<br/>
Going on what Gurman said though, it doesn't sound like Apple has quite perfected the experience, which is probably always going to be degraded by the fatigue caused by having to hold your hands in the air to type, regardless of what Apple does to improve it in future software updates. Fortunately, Vision Pro can wirelessly connect to Mac accessories including the Magic Keyboard and the Magic Trackpad for more traditional tactile input. <br/>
<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple will launch a rare <a href="https://www.apple.com.cn/shop/gifts/chinese-new-year/shopping-event">promotional discount</a> on its iPhones in China, offering customers as much as 500 yuan (&#36;70) off the price of its flagship devices ahead of the Lunar New Year in February.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/apple-discounts-lunar-new-year-2024.jpg" alt="" width="1294" height="840" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-930648" /><br/>
The promotion, which runs from January 18 through January 21, applies to everything from the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-13/">iPhone 13</a> to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a> Max, and also includes smaller discounts off other major Apple products like Macs, iPads, AirPods, and Apple Watch models. <br/>
<br/>
Apple's discounts are notable because the company does not typically offer promotions on its website around the Lunar New Year, usually leaving promotions to Apple authorized resellers instead. <br/>
<br/>
The move comes as Apple tries to stave off falling <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> sales in China, with last year's double-digit decline projected by analysts to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/08/iphone-sales-down-huawei-resurgence-china/">deepen through 2024</a> owing to strong interest in Huawei's latest home-grown lineup, the Mate 60 series.<br/>

Released in September just weeks before the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a>, Huawei's Mate 60 phones use a new China-made 7-nanometer processor tailored for the local market, showcasing the kind of advanced semiconductor manufacturing capabilities that US sanctions were originally designed to prevent.<br/>
<br/>
Despite the promotions, Apple's efforts to counter its sales slump are likely to be hampered by China's decision last year to ban iPhones from the offices of multiple government agencies and state companies. <div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/china/">China</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/15/apple-offers-rare-iphone-discounts-china/">Apple Offers Rare iPhone Discounts in China to Counter Sales Slump</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-offers-rare-iphone-discounts-in-china-to-counter-sales-slump.2416368/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's next-generation iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus models will both feature 8GB of RAM, an increase over the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/12/iphone-15-pro-models-have-8gb-ram/">6GB of RAM in the iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus</a>, according to information shared today by technology analyst Jeff Pu.<br/>
<br/>

In a research note with investment firm Haitong International Securities, Pu reiterated his belief that all iPhone 16 models will be equipped with 8GB of RAM. Increased RAM can contribute to improved performance for multitasking on the iPhone.<br/>
<br/>
iPhone 15 lineup:<ul><li><strong>iPhone 15:</strong> 6GB</li><br/>
<li><strong>iPhone 15 Plus:</strong> 6GB</li><br/>
<li><strong>iPhone 15 Pro:</strong> 8GB</li><br/>
<li><strong>iPhone 15 Pro Max:</strong> 8GB</li></ul>iPhone 16 lineup, according to Pu:<ul><li><strong>iPhone 16:</strong> 8GB</li><br/>
<li><strong>iPhone 16 Plus:</strong> 8GB</li><br/>
<li><strong>iPhone 16 Pro:</strong> 8GB</li><br/>
<li><strong>iPhone 16 Pro Max:</strong> 8GB</li></ul>Pu also expects the iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus to support Wi-Fi 6E, which works with the 6 GHz band, enabling faster wireless speeds and reduced signal interference with a compatible router. For the iPhone 15 lineup, Wi-Fi 6E is limited to the Pro models.<br/>
<br/>
Apple is expected to announce the iPhone 16 lineup in September.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/jeff-pu/">Jeff Pu</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/14/iphone-16-and-16-plus-8gb-ram-rumor/">iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus Rumored to Feature Increased 8GB RAM and Wi-Fi 6E Support</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-16-and-iphone-16-plus-rumored-to-feature-increased-8gb-ram-and-wi-fi-6e-support.2416354/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Qualcomm's latest cellular modem may be limited to the iPhone 16 Pro models this year, according to technology analyst Jeff Pu.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/12/iPhone-16-Pro-Sizes-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-927877" /><br/>
In a research note today with investment firm Haitong International Securities, Pu reiterated his belief that the iPhone 16 Pro models will be equipped with <a href="https://www.qualcomm.com/products/technology/modems/snapdragon-x75-5g-modem-rf-system">Qualcomm's Snapdragon X75 modem</a>. However, he expects the standard iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus to retain the Snapdragon X70 modem found in all iPhone 15 models. This modem differentiation between the standard and Pro models would be a change in strategy for Apple.<br/>
<br/>
Announced in February 2023, the Snapdragon X75 features improved carrier aggregation and other technology advancements for faster 5G download and upload speeds compared to the X70. The modem's combined mmWave and sub-6GHz 5G transceiver takes up 25% less circuit board space, and uses up to 20% less power, according <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/2/15/23600171/qualcomm-snapdragon-x75-5g-modem-rf">to <em>The Verge</em></a>.<br/>
<br/>
The Snapdragon X75 also supports the latest "5G Advanced" standard, which is described as "the next phase of 5G" and an "evolution towards 6G." 5G Advanced will include artificial intelligence and machine learning enhancements for improved 5G performance, and it will also expand 5G to additional device types and use cases.<br/>
<br/>
Apple is likely to advertise 5G Advanced support on the iPhone 16 Pro models, like it did with LTE Advanced on the iPhone 6s in 2015.<br/>
<br/>
Apple is rumored to have been working on its own 5G modem for iPhones since 2018, but the project has reportedly faced development challenges, and the modem is not expected to be announced <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/06/apple-modem-in-2025-kuo/">until 2025 or later</a> should it ever materialize. In the meantime, Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/11/apple-extends-deal-with-qualcomm-as-modem-delayed/">extended its 5G modem agreement with Qualcomm</a> through 2026.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Starting on February 2 at 8 a.m. local time, Apple Stores in the U.S. will allow customers to sign up for a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/08/apple-vision-pro-demos-february-2/">demo of the Vision Pro headset</a>. In an email, Apple said it will be offering demos from February 2 through February 4 on a first‑come, first‑served basis.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/Apple-Vision-Pro-Digital-Crown.jpeg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-930595" /><br/>
In his <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-01-14/how-to-buy-apple-vision-pro-3-499-device-to-go-on-sale-feb-2-lrdjtdm7"><em>Power On</em> newsletter</a> today, <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman said each demo will last around 20 to 25 minutes. After a calibration process, he said the customer will view still photos, panoramas, spatial photos, and spatial videos in the Photos app. Next, he said customers will learn how to position multiple app windows and scroll through pages in Safari. Then, they will view immersive 3D content, including movie clips, sports, and a tightrope scene.<br/>
<br/>
Media personnel, YouTube creators, and some others invited to attend WWDC 2023 at Apple Park last June received a similar demo experience.<br/>
<br/>
Vision Pro demo units will also be preloaded with various third-party apps that will be available on the App Store at launch, according to the newsletter. Apple began <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/08/apple-releases-vision-pro-updates-testflight-xcode/">allowing developers to submit visionOS apps</a> for approval earlier this month.<br/>
<br/>
Apple will begin accepting Vision Pro pre-orders in the U.S. <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/08/apple-announces-february-2-vision-pro-launch/">on January 19</a>, with pricing starting at &#36;3,499.

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's upcoming <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Vision Pro headset</a> is powered by an external battery pack that attaches with a cable. For customers who want to use the headset on the go without pockets or a backpack, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-01-14/how-to-buy-apple-vision-pro-3-499-device-to-go-on-sale-feb-2-lrdjtdm7"><em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman today said</a> that Belkin is planning to release a clip that allows the battery pack to be attached to clothing.<br/>
<br/>

Belkin will begin selling the clip when the Vision Pro <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/08/apple-announces-february-2-vision-pro-launch/">launches in the U.S. on February 2</a>, and Apple will also offer it, according to Gurman.<br/>
<br/>
Belkin offers a range of Apple-endorsed accessories, including iPhone screen protectors, MagSafe charging stands, a Continuity Camera mount for Macs, and more. Many of its accessories are available on Apple's online store.<br/>
<br/>
Apple says the Vision Pro can provide up to two hours of battery life overall, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/08/apple-vision-pro-battery-life-video-playback/">up to 2.5 hours for 2D video playback</a>, on a full charge.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/belkin/">Belkin</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-vision-pro.209">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/14/belkin-vision-pro-battery-pack-clip/">Belkin Expected to Sell Battery Pack Clip Accessory for Apple Vision Pro</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/belkin-expected-to-sell-battery-pack-clip-accessory-for-apple-vision-pro.2416343/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<title>Apple Relocating Siri Evaluation Team in San Diego to Austin</title>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple is relocating a team of around 120 people focused on improving Siri from San Diego to Austin later this year, according to multiple affected employees.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/03/hey-siri-banner-apple.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="630" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-840591" /><br/>
The reorganization was confirmed by Apple today in a statement shared with <em>MacRumors</em>.<br/>
<br/>
"We're bringing our Data Operations Annotations teams in the US together at our campus in Austin, where a majority of the team is already based," an Apple spokesperson said. "Everyone currently employed will have the opportunity to continue their role with Apple in Austin. We are deeply committed to San Diego where we have grown significantly, and are continuing to hire as we expand our world-class engineering teams."<br/>
<br/>
The news was first reported <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-01-14/apple-to-shutter-121-person-san-diego-ai-team-in-reorganization">by <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman</a>, who said employees in San Diego willing to relocate to Austin by June will be able to continue in their roles. The report said employees who do not relocate or find another role within Apple will receive severance pay, and outlines many other specific details.<br/>
<br/>
While some other large tech companies like Google, Microsoft, and Amazon have laid off thousands of employees over the past year, Apple has so far avoided this outcome. However, it is unlikely that all affected employees in San Diego are willing to relocate over a thousand miles away to Austin, so some may be facing termination.<br/>
<br/>
"Data Operations Annotations" employees are primarily tasked with evaluating Siri's responses to queries from customers who have opted in to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2019/08/28/apple-apologizes-over-siri-privacy-concerns/">Siri grading program</a>. In the U.S., this work will continue entirely in Austin going forward. Apple has similar teams in China, Ireland, Singapore, Spain, and other countries around the world.<br/>
<br/>
Apple had approximately 161,000 full-time employees as of September 30, according to a company filing last year.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/14/apple-moving-san-diego-siri-team-to-austin/">Apple Relocating Siri Evaluation Team in San Diego to Austin</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-relocating-siri-evaluation-team-in-san-diego-to-austin.2416340/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>
