		<description><![CDATA[Next year's iPhone 17 models will come with 12GB of RAM, up from the 8GB of RAM expected across Apple's upcoming iPhone 16 models, a reputable source of accurate predictions about Apple's plans has claimed.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/Generic-iPhone-17-Feature-With-Full-Width-Dynamic-Island.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-959827" /><br/>
Onboard memory in the existing iPhone 15 lineup is different between non-Pro and Pro models: The iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus feature 6GB of RAM, while the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max come with 8GB of RAM. This difference is said to be the reason why Apple Intelligence – Apple's AI suite of on-device features – is only currently supported by the iPhone 15 Pro models.<br/>
<ul><li><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/19/apple-iphone-15-pro-requirement-apple-intelligence/">Apple Explains iPhone 15 Pro Requirement for Apple Intelligence</a></li></ul><br/>
Since it is a requirement for Apple Intelligence, all four of Apple's upcoming iPhone 16 models are <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/14/iphone-16-and-16-plus-8gb-ram-rumor/">expected to feature 8GB of RAM</a>, as is the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/13/iphone-se-4-8gb-ram-apple-intelligence/">rumored iPhone SE 4</a>, which is likely to launch in the spring. However, in a <a href="https://weibo.com/1833340431/OukFVf1xQ">Weibo post</a> on Wednesday, Chinese-language user "Phone Chip Expert" said next year's iPhone 17 models will have 12GB of RAM for more advanced on-device AI applications. <br/>
<br/>
"If you're planning to switch to an AI-powered iPhone, the iPhone 17 in 2025 might be a better choice," said the leaker. "This year's iPhone 16 only has 8GB of RAM, with most of the AI processing done in the cloud. Next year's iPhone 17 will have 12GB of RAM and more edge AI applications. This is something to consider for those with a limited budget who want to upgrade their iPhone."<br/>
<ul><li><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/26/apple-likely-iphone-16-launch-date/">iPhone 16 Likely to Launch on September 20 With These New Features</a></li></ul><br/>
Edge AI applications refer to AI processing that occurs directly on the local device, rather than relying on cloud servers. "Edge" refers to the edge of the network, meaning the data processing happens close to the data source (the device itself), rather than in a centralized location like a cloud data center.<br/>
<br/>
This isn't the first time we have heard rumors of additional RAM coming to Apple's 2025 iPhones. In a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/14/iphone-16-and-16-plus-8gb-ram-rumor/">May 2024 research note</a> with investment firm Haitong, analyst Jeff Pu claimed that the iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max will be equipped with 12GB of RAM, while the iPhone 17 and even the rumored iPhone 17 "Slim" or "Air" with an all-new design would stick with 8GB of RAM. However, today's leaker appears to be suggesting that all iPhone 17 models will be equipped with the additional RAM, bringing AI-capable continuity to the lineup.<br/>
<ul><li><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/15/iphone-17-slim-everything-we-know/">iPhone 17 'Air': Everything We Know About Apple's Slim iPhone</a></li></ul><br/>
The leaker "Phone Chip Expert" has a track record of accurate predictions. Phone Chip Expert was the first to reveal that the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2015/09/28/iphone-7-already-rumored-to-be-waterproof/">iPhone 7 would be water-resistant</a> and that the standard iPhone 14 models would continue to use the A15 Bionic chip, while the more advanced A16 chip would be exclusive to the ‌iPhone 14‌ Pro models. These forecasts were later confirmed by multiple credible sources and were proven correct when the products were released.<br/>

More recently, "Phone Chip Expert" was the first source of information about Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/23/apple-developing-its-own-ai-server-processor/">developing its own AI server processor</a> using TSMC's 3nm process, targeting mass production by the second half of 2025.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/">iPhone 16 Pro</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17/">iPhone 17</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/phone-chip-expert/">Phone Chip Expert</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/28/iphone-17-feature-12gb-ram-up-from-8gb/">iPhone 17 to Feature 12GB RAM, Up From 8GB in iPhone 16 Models</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-17-to-feature-12gb-ram-up-from-8gb-in-iphone-16-models.2434567/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[YouTube videos that play a low sound to vibrate water out of the speakers do, in fact, work, according to a deep dive done by <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/27/24228925/remove-water-phone-youtube-vergecast">The Verge</a></em>'s David Pierce and <em>iFixit</em>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/10/Apple_iphone_11-water-resistant.jpg" alt="" width="1632" height="918" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-764222" /><br/>
There are a number of YouTube videos that promise to be able to remove water from an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> using sound, and Pierce wanted to find out if they do what they claimed, so he asked iFixit for some help. iFixit dunked an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-13/">iPhone 13</a> into water with UV dye, played the video, and then left it overnight to dry out.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe title="Sound To Remove Water From Phone Speaker ( GUARANTEED )" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qhItAtZDzU8" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div><br/>
Playing one of the YouTube videos during this process clearly expelled water from the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;'s speaker, and the speakers of other smartphones that were tested from Google and Nokia. The water came out in an initial burst from the sound, but it is worth noting that the video was only able to remove water from the speaker area.<br/>
<br/>
UV dye stained other areas of the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; when it was opened up, so the water wasn't draining from the entire phone. The oscillating tone in the YouTube videos is able to push water out of the speaker grille, but it is not a complete fix for a water-saturated device.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/08/water-speaker-verge-ifixit.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="538" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-962603" /><em><div class="center-wrap">Water coming out of an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;'s speaker when a low-toned sound is played, via <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/27/24228925/remove-water-phone-youtube-vergecast">The Verge and iFixit</a></div></em><br/>
On the Apple Watch, Apple has a built-in feature that uses sound to expel water from the device, but that is more effective because it is a smaller object with fewer nooks and crannies than an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
Apple's modern iPhones have IP68 water and dust resistance, with the 8 representing water resistance. IPx8 means that the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a> can withstand splashes, rain, and accidental dunks up to six meters in depth for 30 minutes. &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; waterproofing does deteriorate over time with wear and tear, and Apple does not cover water damage, so it is best to avoid water exposure when possible.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/27/24228925/remove-water-phone-youtube-vergecast"><em>The Verge</em>'s full look</a> at how these YouTube videos work is well worth checking out.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/27/youtube-videos-water-iphone/">PSA: YouTube Videos Really Can Get Some Water Out of Your iPhone</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/psa-youtube-videos-really-can-get-some-water-out-of-your-iphone.2434544/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Zagg's Mophie brand today announced new versions of its popular Powerstation Plus Mini, Powerstation Plus, and Powerstation Plus Ultra, all of which have been updated with new designs and battery capacity.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/08/powerstation-plus.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-962648" /><br/>
The &#36;50 <a href="https://www.zagg.com/powerstation-plus-mini/">Powerstation Plus Mini</a> features a 5,000mAh battery that will provide a partial charge for most iPhones. It supports 18W charging over USB-C with the built-in cable, and 20W through an extra USB-C port.<br/>
<br/>
Mophie's &#36;80 <a href="https://www.zagg.com/powerstation-plus-2024/">Powerstation Plus</a> has a 10,000mAh battery that should provide a full charge and then some for all of Apple's iPhones, plus it is powerful enough to be used with iPads and smaller Macs. It includes an integrated 30W USB-C cable and a Lightning cable, plus there's an extra USB-C port for charging multiple devices.<br/>
<br/>
The &#36;100 <a href="https://www.zagg.com/powerstation-plus-ultra/">Powerstation Plus Ultra</a> has the same capabilities as the Powerstation Plus with 30W charging and integrated cables, but it also has folding wall prongs so that it can be plugged directly into a power outlet for charging purposes.<br/>
<br/>
All three of Mophie's new power banks support passthrough charging for connected devices and will charge an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> before transferring power to the power station. They also support two-way charging with the built-in cables, and can charge multiple devices at once. Fast charging is also supported, and an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a> can be charged to 50 percent in 25 to 30 minutes.<br/>
<br/>
The Powerstation Plus and Powerstation Mini can be <a href="https://www.zagg.com/">purchased from the Zagg website</a>.

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's latest immersive video series for the Vision Pro is set to launch in early September. "Elevated," a new 3D experience, will be available starting on September 6. A teaser for the show with an upcoming date is listed in the Apple Immersive Video section of the Vision Pro.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/08/apple-vision-pro-elevated-immersive.jpg" alt="" width="1960" height="1102" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-962622" /><br/>
Apple first announced Elevated in July, but did not provide launch timing for the show. According to Apple, the aerial travel series "whisks viewers around iconic vistas from staggering heights" that include volcanoes, waterfalls, and more in Hawaii.<blockquote>Gain an all-new perspective as you take aerial tours of the world's most remarkable landscapes, led by well-known guides with a special connection to each place.</blockquote>While the first episode is set in Hawaii, the second episode, coming at a later date, will feature an autumn scene in New England. Apple is working on multiple new immersive video experiences that are rolling out this year.<br/>
<br/>
Boundless, a series that launched in July, features a first episode with a hot air balloon ride. A second upcoming episode will focus on Arctic Surfing. Apple is planning to release a new immersive performance from The Weeknd, a big wave surfing sports series, a behind-the-scenes view of the 2024 NBA All-Star Weekend, and its first immersive short film called "Submerged."<br/>
<br/>
Vision Pro users can watch the Apple Immersive video content from the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a> app in Australia, Canada, Hong Kong, France, Germany, Japan, Singapore, the U.K., and the U.S. Users in China can watch the content through the Migu Video and Tencent Video apps.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/visionos/">visionOS</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/visionos-2/">visionOS 2</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-vision-pro.209">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/27/vision-pro-immersive-series-elevated/">Apple Immersive Series &#039;Elevated&#039; Coming to Vision Pro on September 6</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-immersive-series-elevated-coming-to-vision-pro-on-september-6.2434540/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/">Apple Music</a> subscribers who want to transfer their playlists over to YouTube Music can now use Apple's Data and Privacy page to do so, Apple says in a <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/120030">new support document</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/08/apple-music.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-962031" /><br/>
After logging in on the Data and Privacy page, &zwnj;Apple Music&zwnj; users can select the "Transfer a copy of your data" option to move playlists from &zwnj;Apple Music&zwnj; to YouTube Music. YouTube Music is the only supported music service for playlist transfers, and Apple does not offer options to transfer to services like Spotify at this time.<br/>
<br/>
To make a transfer, an active &zwnj;Apple Music&zwnj; subscription or iTunes Match subscription and an active YouTube Music account are required. Playlists that are transferred are not deleted from &zwnj;Apple Music&zwnj;, and the transfer process can take anywhere from a few minutes to a few hours depending on how many playlists are being transferred.<br/>
<br/>
Apple has details on what can be transferred and what can't:<br/>
<ul><br/>
 	<li>Only the playlists that you've created (including collaborative playlists that you own) are transferred</li><br/>
 	<li>Music files aren't transferred</li><br/>
 	<li>Non-collaborative shared playlists and curated playlists aren't transferred</li><br/>
 	<li>Folders in which you've organized your &zwnj;Apple Music&zwnj; playlists aren't transferred</li><br/>
 	<li>Playlists can include only songs available on YouTube Music. If your playlists contains other audio files -- such as podcasts, audio books, or user-uploaded audio files -- they won't be transferred.</li><br/>
</ul><br/>
After the transfer process has been completed, playlists from &zwnj;Apple Music&zwnj; will appear in the Library tab in YouTube Music. If a song is missing, it might not be available on YouTube Music.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/27/apple-music-youtube-music-playlist-transfer/">Apple Now Lets Users Transfer Apple Music Playlists to YouTube Music</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-now-lets-users-transfer-apple-music-playlists-to-youtube-music.2434538/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[AT&T will pay a &#36;950,000 fine for failing to notify 911 call centers about a service outage that occurred in 2023, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/document/fcc-settles-att-2023-911-outage-violations-950000">said this week</a>. There was an AT&T outage in Illinois, Kansas, Texas, and Wisconsin in August 2023, and AT&T was penalized both for failing to deliver 911 calls and for not notifying call centers in a timely manner.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/ATT-Banner.jpeg" alt="" width="1200" height="630" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-937556" /><br/>
The outage happened when AT&T was testing its 911 network. A technician accidentally disabled a portion of the network, and AT&T's system did not adjust to accommodate the disabled part of the network. It was not part of planned maintenance, and there was no stringent technical review. During the outage period, which lasted for a little over an hour, there were more than 400 failed 911 calls.<br/>
<br/>
In addition to paying a &#36;950,000 fine, AT&T has implemented a three-year compliance plan to make sure that it does not violate the FCC's 911 and outage notification rules going forward.<br/>
<br/>
Service providers like AT&T are required to let call centers know about an outage right away so that the public can be notified about alternative ways to get emergency assistance.<br/>
<br/>
It's been a bad year for AT&T. <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/01/att-data-leak-notifications/">In March</a>, AT&T confirmed that a 2021 data leak included the passcodes and sensitive info from 7.6 million AT&T customers and 65.4 million former AT&T customers. AT&T claimed that the data was obtained without unauthorized access to its systems, but hackers were able to get their hands on names, addresses, birth dates, phone numbers, social security numbers, and more from customers.<br/>
<br/>
In April, the company was <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/29/fcc-fines-carriers-customer-data-sharing/">fined over &#36;57 million</a> for illegally sharing customer data with third-party data aggregators, an issue that Verizon and T-Mobile also had to shell out money for.<br/>
<br/>
In July, AT&T <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/12/hackers-steal-att-phone-records/">announced a second major data breach</a>. Hackers were able to get into a cloud platform used by AT&T, and stole the records of "nearly all" of its cellular customers.

		<description><![CDATA[Nomad today announced the launch of its latest Apple Watch accessory, the <a href="https://nomadgoods.com/collections/rocky-point">Rocky Point Band</a>. The Rocky Point Band was created with the Apple Watch Ultra in mind, and it has a rugged look that matches well with Apple's watch for outdoor enthusiasts.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/08/nomad-rocky-point-apple-watch-band.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-962640" /><br/>
According to Nomad, the Rocky Point Band is made from "ultra-touch, compression-molded FKM" fluoroelastomer rubber, and it is equipped with grade 2 lightweight titanium hardware to match the Apple Watch Ultra. The company used metal injection molding titanium to create the components for the band.<br/>
<br/>
The design includes ventilation grooves for breathability, and it is entirely waterproof. While designed for the Apple Watch Ultra and Ultra 2, it is also compatible with all Apple Watch models.<br/>
<br/>
Nomad is offering the Rocky Point Band in Storm, Sol, and Atlantic shades, and it can be <a href="https://nomadgoods.com/collections/rocky-point">purchased from the Nomad website</a> for &#36;80.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/27/nomad-apple-watch-ultra-band/">Nomad Debuts New Rocky Point Band for Apple Watch Ultra</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/nomad-debuts-new-rocky-point-band-for-apple-watch-ultra.2434535/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Instagram <a href="https://creators.instagram.com/blog/new-text-tools-to-help-you-personalize-your-content">today announced</a> support for adding text and additional images to photo and carousel posts, a new feature that will let Instagram users do more with still photos.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/03/Instagram-Feature-2.jpg" alt="" width="2250" height="1266" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-786418" /><br/>
There is a new text button that can be used after selecting a photo to upload, and additional images can be added in sticker form by tapping on the gallery button at the top right of the screen. Stickers can be added in several shapes, including rectangle, square, circle, heart, or star.<br/>
<br/>

There are new fonts, animations, and effects that can be used for reels and stories, plus a simplified text tool. Users can open the text tool and tap on the text button to see the new font options. Once a font is chosen, separate animations and effects can be added. The new font options that Instagram is adopting can also be used with photos and carousels.<br/>
<br/>
Earlier this month, Instagram <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/08/instagram-20-photos-carousel-posts/">added support</a> for putting up to 20 photos and videos in a carousel post, plus it introduced a feature for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/23/instagram-song-on-profile-feature/">adding a song</a> to an Instagram profile.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/instagram/">Instagram</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/27/instagram-text-stickers-photos/">Instagram Now Supports Adding Text and Stickers to Photos</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/instagram-now-supports-adding-text-and-stickers-to-photos.2434527/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[While Apple refreshed the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a> and the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/">iPad Air</a> in May 2024, the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-mini/">iPad mini</a> is still in need of an update. Apple last introduced a new &zwnj;iPad mini&zwnj; in September 2021, so it's overdue for an overhaul.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/ipad-mini-blue-2.jpg" alt="" width="1607" height="905" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-937844" /><br/>
Rumors suggest that Apple has plans to refresh its smallest tablet later in 2024, and this guide highlights all of the rumors we've heard about the device so far.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="display_and_design">Display and Design</h2><br/>
We haven't heard rumors of design changes for the &zwnj;iPad mini&zwnj;, which means it will likely feature the same 8.3-inch size and all-display design. The current &zwnj;iPad mini&zwnj; has a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/touch-id/">Touch ID</a> Power Button, which we're also expecting for the new model.<br/>
<br/>
According to a 2023 rumor, Apple will <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/13/jelly-scrolling-reduced-on-ipad-mini-7/">make a small tweak</a> to the &zwnj;iPad mini&zwnj;'s display in an effort to cut down on "jelly scrolling." The screen assembly will be rotated, which is supposed to reduce the effect when using the &zwnj;iPad mini&zwnj; in portrait orientation.<br/>
<br/>
Jelly scrolling refers to noticeable lag when scrolling vertically through text-based context like a webpage. Each line appears to tilt downward toward the left of the screen as it passes, which makes it look like one side of the display is responding faster. Apple says that this is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/28/apple-jelly-scrolling-normal-behavior/">normal behavior</a> for LCD iPads, but the company still wants to make a change to minimize the effect.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="a-series_chip">A-Series Chip</h2><br/>
The &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; and the &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; have M-series chips, but we're not expecting the &zwnj;iPad mini&zwnj; to get a Mac chip this year. Instead, Apple is likely to go with the A17 Pro that was used in the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a> models, or some other A17 variant that's capable of handling Apple Intelligence.<br/>
<br/>
It's also possible that the &zwnj;iPad mini&zwnj; will get an A18 chip if it comes after the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a> lineup, as rumors suggest the &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; models will have chips in the A18 family.<br/>
<br/>
With an A17 Pro or better, the &zwnj;iPad mini&zwnj; would be on par with or faster than the &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; models, but it won't have the speeds of the &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; or &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="new_colors">New Colors</h2><br/>
The &zwnj;iPad mini&zwnj; is available in space gray, starlight, pink, and purple right now. Apple often refreshes color options with updates, so new colors are a definite possibility. With the &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj;, which the &zwnj;iPad mini&zwnj; often mimics, Apple got rid of pink.<br/>
<br/>
If Apple makes the &zwnj;iPad mini&zwnj; available in the same colors as the &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj;, it could come in space gray, purple, blue, and starlight.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="front_camera">Front Camera</h2><br/>
Apple moved the front-facing camera on the &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; to the landscape edge of the device, and it could make the same change for the &zwnj;iPad mini&zwnj;. It may make less sense to have a landscape camera on an &zwnj;iPad mini&zwnj;, though, because it's less often used with keyboards.<br/>
<br/>
The camera could get support for HDR 4 and it could have a wider aperture, if it adopts the camera used in the &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="connectivity">Connectivity</h2><br/>
Apple has been adding Wi-Fi 6E to each product as it's updated, and it should be the &zwnj;iPad mini&zwnj;'s turn this year. Wi-Fi 6E will allow the &zwnj;iPad mini&zwnj; to connect to the 6GHz Wi-Fi band on supported routers.<br/>
<br/>
Bluetooth 5.3 is also expected, as that's another update Apple has been making to new devices, and the &zwnj;iPad mini&zwnj; could lose its nano-SIM slot, with Apple opting only for eSIM.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="apple_pencil_pro">Apple Pencil Pro</h2><br/>
The current &zwnj;iPad mini&zwnj; works with the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-pencil/">Apple Pencil</a> 2, so the new model will likely support the &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; Pro. The &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; Pro has a squeeze gesture, haptic feedback, a gyroscope for barrel roll support, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/find-my-network-accessory-program/">Find My</a> integration.<br/>
<br/>
&zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; hover might also be a new feature, as the current &zwnj;iPad mini&zwnj; does not support it.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="release_date">Release Date</h2><br/>
Apple will likely release a new &zwnj;iPad mini&zwnj; toward the end of the year, likely in September or October. In some years, Apple holds a special October event for Macs and iPads, and we could get that in 2024. Apple is planning to hold an iPhone-centric event on Monday, September 9, so it's also entirely possible the &zwnj;iPad mini&zwnj; will see a debut then.<br/>
<br/>
There are, however, refreshes coming for the MacBook Pro, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-mini/">Mac mini</a>, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/">iMac</a>, so it would also make sense for Apple to hold a second fall event.<br/>
<br/>
Supplies of the current sixth-generation &zwnj;iPad mini&zwnj; are <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/26/ipad-mini-stock-dwindling/">starting to dwindle</a> in stores, which could be a sign that a refresh is coming in the near future.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="future_ipad_mini_models">Future iPad mini Models</h2><br/>
There are rumors that Apple is working on a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/02/apple-foldable-2026-could-replace-ipad-mini/">foldable iPad mini</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/11/apple-planning-to-bring-oled-to-ipad-mini-and-air/">OLED display technology</a> for the &zwnj;iPad mini&zwnj;, but neither of these updates are expected in 2024.<br/>
<br/>
An OLED display or a foldable &zwnj;iPad mini&zwnj; are technologies not expected until 2026, 2027, or even later.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ipad-mini-7/">What to Expect From Apple&#039;s 2024 iPad Mini 7</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/what-to-expect-from-apples-2024-ipad-mini-7.2427857/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<title>AirPods Max 2: What Rumors Say Ahead of the Apple Event Next Month</title>

		<description><![CDATA[It has been nearly four years since Apple released the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-max/">AirPods Max</a>, so an update to the over-ear headphones is highly anticipated.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/Airpods-Max-Feature-Blue.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-936392" /><br/>
Below, we recap the latest rumors about the AirPods Max.<br/>
<br/>
As a refresher, Apple released the AirPods Max in December 2020, after announcing them in a press release shared on the Apple Newsroom website. The headphones have not received any hardware upgrades since, leading some customers to hold off on their purchase and hope that Apple will eventually release AirPods Max 2.<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately, rumors suggest that AirPods Max 2 are not coming any time soon, with only minor revisions expected for the headphones later this year.<br/>
<br/>
<em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman previously reported that Apple is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/29/gurman-usb-c-airpods-max-late-2024/">planning to update the AirPods Max in late 2024</a> with a USB-C charging port, instead of the current Lightning port, and he said new color options are also a possibility for the headphones. Beyond that, Gurman said Apple is planning <a href="https://x.com/markgurman/status/1762690933659988326">no other changes</a> for the revised AirPods Max, to the point that he expects the updated headphones to still be considered first-generation AirPods Max.<br/>
<br/>
If the information shared by Gurman is accurate, that means the AirPods Max would not be updated with the H2 chip that debuted in the second-generation AirPods Pro a few years ago. As a result, the AirPods Max would <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/20/airpods-max-2-could-miss-out-on-adaptive-audio/">miss out on Adaptive Audio features</a>, along with longer battery life afforded by the H2 chip's increased power efficiency.<br/>
<br/>
In the event Apple ever does release AirPods Max 2, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/12/airpods-max-2-launch-next-year-what-to-expect/">plausible upgrades</a> include the H2 chip, longer battery life, improved active noise cancellation, a U2 chip with support for Precision Finding in the Find My app, Bluetooth 5.3, and a redesigned carrying case.<br/>
<br/>
Gurman said the AirPods Max would be updated in late 2024, but it is unclear exactly when. Apple recently announced that it will be <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/26/apple-september-9-iphone-event/">holding a media event on September 9</a>, where it is expected to unveil <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/19/gurman-airpods-4-this-year/">fourth-generation AirPods</a> alongside new iPhones and Apple Watches, but it is unclear if the revised AirPods Max will also be introduced then.<br/>
<br/>
AirPods Max are regularly &#36;549 in the U.S., but <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/26/airpods-max-hit-399/">Amazon has the headphones on sale for &#36;399</a> in all color options, including Green, Pink, Silver, Sky Blue, and Space Gray.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-max/">AirPods Max</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AirPods-Max">AirPods Max (Caution)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/airpods.216">AirPods</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/27/airpods-max-2-rumor-recap/">AirPods Max 2: What Rumors Say Ahead of the Apple Event Next Month</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/airpods-max-2-what-rumors-say-ahead-of-the-apple-event-next-month.2434521/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

Pre-orders are likely to open on Friday, September 13, with launch following one week later on Friday, September 20.

<br/>
<h2 id="will_it_be_worth_upgrading">Will It Be Worth Upgrading?</h2><br/>
The &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; was a fairly significant upgrade over the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-14/">iPhone 14</a> Pro in 2023, introducing a new design with a titanium frame, slimmer bezels, the Action button, a USB-C port, and more. Based on what we know so far, the &zwnj;iPhone 16 Pro&zwnj;'s upgrades will likely not be as substantial as those offered by its predecessor. Most &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; users will probably have little reason to upgrade, but some who would appreciate a slightly larger display, better cameras, and a dedicated button for photography and videography features may find it worthwhile.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/">iPhone 16 Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-15-Pro">iPhone 15 Pro (Don't Buy)</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone-15-pro-vs-iphone-16-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro vs. iPhone 16 Pro: 30+ Rumored Upgrades Compared</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-15-pro-vs-iphone-16-pro-30-rumored-upgrades-compared.2419268/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/05/General-Snapcaht-Apps-Feature-2.jpg" alt="" width="2250" height="1266" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-800481" /><br/>
Snapchat's latest update allows the app to run natively on &zwnj;iPad&zwnj;, utilizing the device's full screen for the first time. Until now, &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; users who wanted to use Snapchat had to run the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> version of the app, which was not optimized for the larger display, leaving it to run at a lower resolution with large surrounding black borders like other unoptimized apps. Snapchat for &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; app currently only supports portrait mode, meaning users cannot rotate the device to use the app in landscape mode. The update comes more than a decade after Snapchat's initial release on iOS back in 2011. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote>Snapchat now offers native support for iPad! This means that Snapchat will fill an iPad's full screen, providing you with a larger canvas when capturing Snaps and allowing you to see more friends on the 2nd and 4th tabs.</blockquote><br/>
<br/>
Earlier this year, Snapchat introduced several AI-powered features, including one called "My AI" that allows users to engage with an AI assistant to create reminders or start countdowns, either in a direct chat or within conversations with friends. <br/>
<br/>
Snapchat continues to be <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/snapchat/id447188370?platform=ipad">available for free on the App Store</a> and requires iOS 13 or iPadOS 13, or later.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/snapchat/">Snapchat</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/27/snapchat-finally-comes-to-ipad/">Snapchat Finally Comes to iPad After 13 Years</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/snapchat-finally-comes-to-ipad-after-13-years.2434502/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[While there have been <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/19/gurman-airpods-4-this-year/">many rumors about the upcoming AirPods 4</a>, a leaker has now shared an alleged upgrade planned for the AirPods Pro 3.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/09/AirPods-Pro-Second-Generation.jpeg" alt="" width="1600" height="895" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-861934" /><br/>
In a post today on social media platform X, the previously-accurate leaker known as Kosutami claimed that the AirPods Pro 3 will feature <a href="https://x.com/Kosutami_Ito/status/1828313529369125020">"much better" active noise cancellation</a> compared to the AirPods Pro 2, which launched nearly two years ago. However, the leaker did not provide any specific details about this alleged upgrade.<br/>
<br/>
Apple already advertises the AirPods Pro 2 as featuring "up to twice as much" active noise cancellation compared to the original AirPods Pro, so the AirPods Pro 3 would be even more improved in this regard.<br/>
<br/>
Apple is expected to announce both low-end and mid-tier AirPods 4 models during its September 9 special event. Kosutami claimed that the AirPods Pro 3 are also <a href="https://x.com/Kosutami_Ito/status/1828351173784674478">coming "soon,"</a> but it is unclear if this information is accurate, as <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman has <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-10-25/apple-airpods-plans-4th-generation-low-end-3rd-generation-pro-and-usb-c-max">previously reported</a> that Apple planned to release redesigned AirPods Pro in 2025.<br/>
<br/>
Both the low-end and mid-tier AirPods 4 are rumored to feature a revised design with better fit in the ear, improved sound quality, and an updated charging case with a USB-C port. The mid-tier AirPods 4 are also said to feature active noise cancellation, and a speaker in the charging case that can play a sound for Find My location tracking.<br/>
<br/>
AirPods Max are also rumored to be updated later this year, but the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/29/gurman-usb-c-airpods-max-late-2024/">only change expected is a USB-C charging port</a> instead of Lightning.<br/>
<br/>
Kosutami is known as a prototype Apple product collector, but he has occasionally shared accurate information about Apple's future plans, including <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/12/exclusive-first-look-finewoven-apple-watch-band/">details about FineWoven accessories</a> before they launched last year. Kosutami also said that iPhone 16 Pro batteries <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/20/iphone-16-pro-leak-reveals-redesigned-battery/">will have a metal enclosure</a>, and this change was later corroborated by other sources.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/">AirPods Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/kosutami/">Kosutami</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AirPods-Pro">AirPods Pro (Neutral)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/airpods.216">AirPods</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/27/airpods-pro-3-much-better-anc-rumor/">AirPods Pro 3 Rumored to Feature &#039;Much Better&#039; Active Noise Cancellation</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/airpods-pro-3-rumored-to-feature-much-better-active-noise-cancellation.2434494/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[On September 9, 2014, towards the end of Apple's iPhone 6 press event, CEO Tim Cook announced "one more thing," and after a brief video, appeared on stage <a href="https://youtu.be/38IqQpwPe7s?t=3428" rel="noopener" target="_blank">wearing the first Apple Watch</a>. The date of the original device's unveiling has led some to wonder whether Apple's upcoming <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/26/apple-september-9-iphone-event/">iPhone 16 event on Monday, September 9</a> could see a special tenth anniversary version of the Apple Watch debut.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/08/Apple-Watch-X-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-906752" /><br/>
The first chatter about a possible "Apple Watch X" appeared back in January 2023, when a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/01/23/sketchy-apple-watch-x-rumor/">French report</a> claimed that Apple planned to skip the Apple Watch Series 9, much like the company did when it launched the iPhone X instead of an iPhone 9 model in 2017. Pronounced "ten," the "X" branding referred to the iPhone's 10th anniversary.<br/>
<br/>
That didn't happen. Indeed, if "Apple Watch X" had launched in 2023, only nine years would have elapsed since Cook unveiled the original model, which is why the rumor was branded "sketchy." For the "X" branding to logically make sense, Apple would have to announce it in 2024 – on Monday, September 9, to be exact, which happens to be the date of Apple's iPhone 16 event.<br/>
<br/>
However, there's still uncertainty about whether Apple will unveil a special edition "Apple Watch X" or a more standard issue Apple Watch Series 10 at next month's event. One reason is that after the original Apple Watch presentation in September 2014, it actually took seven months before customers got their hands on the smartwatch, with the device's official release occurring on April 24, 2015.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/38IqQpwPe7s?si=GnZmquAQ2D326RKC&amp;start=3428" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><div class="center-wrap"><em>Tim Cook unveils the original Apple Watch in Sept 2014</em></div><br/>
Another reason is that the device Apple is rumored to be preparing appears, on paper, to be a rather modest upgrade on its predecessor. According to <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman, Apple is planning to debut a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/07/series-10-larger-screens-and-faster-chip/">thinner version of the Apple Watch</a> this year, but he has said it is "unlikely" that it will look much different than the current models. In August 2023, when Gurman first mentioned a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/13/gurman-apple-watch-x-redesign-planned/">thinner tenth anniversary model</a>, he said that Apple was considering a magnetic band attachment system that would free up space in the Apple Watch. However, his most recent reports have not mentioned this functionality. <br/>
<br/>
Apple has also been working on hypertension and sleep apnea detection for this year's model, but Gurman says these features <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/07/series-10-larger-screens-and-faster-chip/">may not be ready to launch</a>. Apple is reportedly having issues with reliability for the hypertension feature, which could lead to delays, and the sleep apnea detection relies on blood oxygen monitoring that Apple has had to temporarily remove from the Apple Watch due to patent issues.<br/>
<ul><li><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-watch-ultra-3-everything-we-know/">Apple Watch Ultra 3: Everything We Know So Far</a></li></ul><br/>
Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo has also <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/17/kuo-apple-watch-series-10-larger-screen-thinner/">suggested</a> that the 2024 Apple Watch will have a thinner body with larger screen sizes. Kuo expects this year's model to be available in 45mm and 49mm sizes, up from the current 41mm and 45mm size options. However, Kuo made no mention of the possibility that this could be a tenth anniversary edition.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/apple-watch-x-91mobiles.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-956954" /><div class="center-wrap"><em>Alleged next-generation Apple Watch CAD render</em></div><br/>
CAD renders of what might be the next-generation Apple Watch <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/26/alleged-first-look-at-apple-watch-x-series-10/">surfaced in June</a>, allegedly depicting a larger model with a two inch display, which is a bit bigger than the 1.93-inch Apple Watch Ultra. The dimensions are said to measure roughly 46 x 39.7 x 11.6mm, so that would be a bit larger than the Series 9 but smaller than the Apple Watch Ultra. The design seems to have the same Digital Crown and Side Button, and it is overall similar to the Apple Watch Series 9. But there is no evidence of a notably slimmed down case or a magnetic band attachment system.<br/>
<ul><li><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/26/apple-likely-iphone-16-launch-date/">iPhone 16 Likely to Launch on September 20 With These New Features</a></li></ul><br/>
In summary, with the Apple Watch Series 9 available now, an Apple Watch Series 10 or "X" would be more appropriate for 2024, not 2025, but the X naming is just speculation at this point, and Apple may not feel that the device justifies the branding. Alongside the iPhone 16 and new AirPods, Apple plans to introduce the next-generation Apple Watch at its September 9 event, dubbed "It's Glowtime," with a launch likely to follow on September 20.

		<description><![CDATA[Supplies of the sixth-generation <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-mini/">iPad mini</a> are dwindling at "many" Apple retail stores, which is a sign that a new model could be coming, according to <em>Bloomberg</em>'s <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/10/ipad-mini-blue.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-868315" /><br/>
Gurman <a href="https://x.com/markgurman/status/1828188631015792709">said in a tweet</a> that the &zwnj;iPad mini&zwnj; is considered "constrained" internally at Apple, and that might be an indication that a refresh is on the horizon. The sixth-generation &zwnj;iPad mini&zwnj; was initially introduced in September 2021, so it almost three years old at this point.<br/>
<br/>
Apple has been working on a seventh-generation version of the &zwnj;iPad mini&zwnj;, and rumors have suggested that it <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/13/ipad-mini-7-not-expected-before-late-2024/">could come out this year</a>. The next &zwnj;iPad mini&zwnj; is expected to include an A17 Pro or better chip to support Apple Intelligence, along with updated front and rear cameras. Updates that Apple has been making across its product lineup could also be included, such as Wi-Fi 6E and Bluetooth 5.3.<br/>
<br/>
Apple today announced plans to hold a fall iPhone-centric event on September 9 to introduce the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a> models, new Apple Watch models, and new AirPods. It is not clear if Apple will also refresh the &zwnj;iPad mini&zwnj; at that time, but Apple could hold a new version for a second fall event or announcement.<br/>
<br/>
We are still counting on several M4 Macs this year, so there will likely be some kind of second announcement. Apple is rumored to be planning to refresh the MacBook Pro, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-mini/">Mac mini</a>, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/">iMac</a> with M4 chips, so an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> with a similar A-series chip would fit in with those announcements.<br/>
<br/>
Apple updated the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a> models with M4 chips earlier this year, and introduced a two versions of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/">iPad Air</a> with an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m2/">M2</a> chip.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-mini/">iPad mini</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPad_Mini">iPad Mini (Don't Buy)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipad.137">iPad</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/26/ipad-mini-stock-dwindling/">iPad Mini Stock Dwindling at Apple Stores, Refresh Could Be Coming</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ipad-mini-stock-dwindling-at-apple-stores-refresh-could-be-coming.2434457/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>
