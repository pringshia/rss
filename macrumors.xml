<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/paypal.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-915339" /><br/>
The new integration means users can use the cards to make contactless payments in-store, and use iPhones, iPads, and Macs to make purchases in apps and on the web using <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-pay/">Apple Pay</a>.<br/>
<br/>
To get started, users should open the Apple Wallet app, tap the + button, then select the add "Debit or Credit Card" option. Cards can then be scanned or card details entered manually. PayPal says that users will be able to do this directly in the PayPal or Venmo apps in the coming months. <br/>
<br/>
When making payments with &zwnj;Apple Pay&zwnj;, users can earn 2% on purchases with the PayPal Cashback Credit Card, earn PayPal Rewards points when shopping with the PayPal Debit Card and redeem them for cash back or other rewards, and earn cashback with the Venmo Debit Card at participating businesses.

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today released the second beta of an upcoming iOS 17.1 update, and the software further refines some of the new features that were added both in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a> and the initial iOS 17.1 beta.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/iOS-17.1-Feature-Fall-Muted.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-915266" /><br/>
This guide covers everything new in the second iOS 17.1 beta.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>StandBy Display Options</h2><br/>
Apple added a new "Display" section to the StandBy section of the Settings app, which houses some new customization options. The display can be set to turn off automatically, after 20 seconds, or never.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/standby-display-settings-ios-17-1.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-915259" /><br/>
The existing <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/night-mode/">Night Mode</a> function that adds a red tint and dims the screen has been relocated to this section, as has the Motion to Wake toggle. The Display section also replaces the prior Always On toggle that limited the display to turning off intelligently.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Ringtones and Text Tones</h2><br/>
iOS 17.1 beta 1 removed the more than 20 ringtones and text tones that were added in the launch version of &zwnj;iOS 17&zwnj;, but they have been reintroduced.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/ios-17-1-ringtones.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-915262" /><br/>
The new ringtones include Arpeggio, Breaking, Canopy, Chalet, Chirp, Daybreak, Departure, Dollop, Journey, Kettle, Mercury, Milky Way, Quad, Radial, Scavenger, Seedling, Shelter, Sprinkles, Steps, Storytime, Tease, Tilt, Unfold, and Valley. Reflection continues to be the default ringtone option.<br/>
<br/>
Compared to the old ringtones, many of the new ringtones are longer in length and sound more modern. Apple has moved all of the prior ringtones to the "Classic" section so they are still accessible for those who prefer options like Illuminate, Night Owl, Constellation, and Twinkle.<br/>
<br/>
There are more than 10 new text tones that can be used for incoming text messages, voicemails, incoming mail alerts, reminder alerts, and more.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>80% Charging Limit Fix</h2><br/>
With the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a> models, Apple added a toggle that prevents the devices from charging past 80 percent in order to keep the battery healthy for a longer period of time. In the prior beta, the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> would ignore this setting and charge past 80 percent, but that no longer happens following the second beta update.<br/>
<br/>

<h2>Double Tap</h2><br/>
Double Tap is enabled in the second watchOS 10.1 beta that was provided to developers today, but the settings for it can be managed using the Apple Watch app.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/watchos-10-1-double-tap.jpg" alt="" width="2901" height="1632" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-915258" /><br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Netflix plans to increase the price of its ad-free subscription plans a few months after the end of the Hollywood actors strike, reports <em><a href="https://www.wsj.com/business/media/netflix-price-increase-actors-strike-792de9be">The Wall Street Journal</a></em>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/02/Netflix-Smaller-2.jpg" alt="" width="2250" height="1266" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-884792" /><br/>
Prices will go up in the United States and Canada first, and it is not yet clear how much more Netflix will charge. Netflix <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/01/14/netflix-raises-prices/">last raised prices</a> at the beginning of 2022, charging &#36;9.99 per month for the Basic plan, &#36;15.49 per month for the Standard plan, and &#36;19.99 per month for the Premium plan.<br/>
<br/>
Netflix has since eliminated the Basic plan and added a Standard with ads plan that is priced at &#36;6.99 per month. The company has also ended all multi-household sharing, so Netflix users must reside in the same location to share a Netflix plan, otherwise there is an additional cost for another member slot.<br/>
<br/>
Multiple streaming services have been raising their prices this year. Ad-free Disney+ streaming will soon be &#36;13.99 per month, and ad-free Hulu is going to be &#36;17.99 per month following price hikes set to go live this month. There is no specific word yet on when Netflix will raise prices.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/netflix/">Netflix</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/03/netflix-price-increase/">Netflix to Raise Ad-Free Subscription Prices Soon</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/netflix-to-raise-ad-free-subscription-prices-soon.2406185/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<title>iOS 17.1 Code References Apple Pencil With USB-C</title>

		<description><![CDATA[<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-pencil/">Apple Pencil</a> code that was added to the second beta of iOS 17.1 references USB-C charging for the &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj;, a function that does not exist for either of the two current &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; models that Apple sells.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/06/black-apple-pencil-feature-orange.jpg" alt="" width="2404" height="1356" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-744321" /><br/>
"Connect to USB-C to recharge soon," reads the text, which is accompanied by another line that says "&zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; Battery Very Low."<br/>
<br/>
It is not clear if this is a reference to a new version of the &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; or text that is related to the <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MQLU3AM/A/usb-c-to-apple-pencil-adapter">USB-C to Apple Pencil Adapter</a> that allows the first-generation &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; to be charged using a 10th-generation <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>. With this adapter, the &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; plugs in to the Lightning end of the Adapter and the USB-C connector plugs into the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj;, facilitating a charge over USB-C.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">iOS 17.1 Beta 2 (21B5056e) changes:<br><br>- Double Tap support added to watchOS 10.1 Beta 2 for Apple Watch Series 9 and Ultra 2<br>- New Standby settings<br><br>Apple Pencil 3?<br><br>Also, code in beta 2 suggests that Apple might be planning an Apple Pencil 3 with USB-C charging support.

Given that this adapter <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/10/21/apple-pencil-adapter-shipping-delay/">came out last year</a>, it is not quite clear why Apple is just now adding the text, but it is a logical explanation and could be related to the possible launch of a next-generation low-cost &zwnj;iPad&zwnj;. The other option is that Apple is working on a new version of the &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; with a USB-C connector.<br/>
<br/>
Apple could in theory refresh the original &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; to replace the Lightning connector with a USB-C connector without too much hassle, allowing the company to carry on offering the higher-end, slimmer magnetic &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; that works with the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a> and other iPads, and the lower-cost, rounder &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; that charges via a connector and works with Apple's low-cost &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; lineup.<br/>
<br/>
A USB-C port might not make sense if Apple has plans for a third-generation &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; compatible with all iPads, as the new version would likely take after the second-generation &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; and charge magnetically via an &zwnj;iPad&zwnj;. A single &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; that has no connector at all and is able to work with all iPads would simplify the &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; lineup and cut down on any confusion.<br/>
<br/>
Apple is transitioning its products to USB-C because of new European Union regulations that require electronics to use a universal port. Apple could opt for a USB-C charging option for fast charging purposes, but a future &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; would also be able to skirt the USB-C requirement with wireless charging.<br/>
<br/>
Whether or not a new &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; has USB-C, there seems to be a third-generation version in the works. Earlier this week, a rumor suggested that the next &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; would feature magnetic tips with different shapes for drawing, sketching, and painting.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-pencil/">Apple Pencil</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipad-accessories.139">iPad Accessories</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/03/ios-17-1-apple-pencil-usb-c/">iOS 17.1 Code References Apple Pencil With USB-C</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-17-1-code-references-apple-pencil-with-usb-c.2406180/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

Emergency text messages will be set out to cell phones across the United States.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/emergency-test-alert-fema-wea.jpg" alt="" width="2585" height="1454" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-915268" /><br/>
The Wireless Emergency Alert test is scheduled to begin at 2:20 p.m. Eastern Time tomorrow, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> owners can expect to receive a text message in English or Spanish, depending on the language settings of the device. In addition to smartphones, test messages will also be sent to televisions and radios.<br/>
<br/>
Test messages going to smartphones will make it clear that the alert is a test, with the following text: "THIS IS A TEST of the National Wireless Emergency Alert System. No action is needed." An "alert tone" will be played when the notification is initially received.<br/>
<br/>
Wireless Emergency Alerts are used in the United States to allow federal, state, and local agencies to send out short emergency messages from cell towers in a targeted area. They are designed to warn of an impending natural or human-made disaster, though the system is also used for child abductions and public safety alerts.<br/>
<br/>
AMBER Alerts, Emergency Alerts, Public Safety Alerts, and Test Alerts can all be enabled or disabled on an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; by going to the Notifications section of the Settings app and scrolling all the way down to Government Alerts. Turning off the toggles will prevent the alerts from being received.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/03/iphone-emergency-alert-test-october-4/">U.S. iPhone Users to Receive Emergency Test Alert Tomorrow</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/u-s-iphone-users-to-receive-emergency-test-alert-tomorrow.2406166/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[With the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a>, Apple replaced the traditional mute switch with a new multi-function Action Button. The button can be assigned to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/iphone-15-pro-how-to-customize-action-button/">perform a number of tasks</a>, ranging from activating the flashlight to turning on the camera. Perhaps the most useful way to use the Action Button is with Shortcuts, because the single button can perform more than one action at once or bring up a selection of tools.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/le7zAdF36R8" title="iPhone 15 Pro Action Button: Best Custom Shortcuts!" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe><em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/macrumors?sub_confirmation=1">Subscribe to the MacRumors YouTube channel</a> for more videos.</em></div><br/>
We've rounded up three of the best methods for using Shortcuts to get the most out of the Action Button.<br/>
<ol><br/>
 	<li><strong><a href="https://www.macstories.net/ios/introducing-multibutton-assign-two-shortcuts-to-the-same-action-button-press-on-iphone-15-pro/">MultiButton Shortcut</a></strong> - Federico Vittici of <em>MacStories</em> created a way for two separate shortcuts to be assigned to the Action button. With MultiButton, if you press the Action Button once, it runs the primary shortcut, but if you press it twice in quick succession, it will run a secondary shortcut. Since Apple doesn't support multiple presses for the Action Button, this is a clever workaround. The MultiButton Shortcut is available from <em><a href="https://www.macstories.net/ios/introducing-multibutton-assign-two-shortcuts-to-the-same-action-button-press-on-iphone-15-pro/">MacStories</a></em>, and Viticci also has some Shortcut suggestions to use with the MultiButton.</li><br/>
 	<li><b><a href="https://twitter.com/vittortech/status/1705580354218701154">Position-Based Actions</a></b> - YouTuber Dan Vittorini created a Shortcut that performs different actions depending on the orientation of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> when it's activated. If the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; is in portrait orientation, it toggles silent mode. If the phone is held with the top to the left, it takes a photo, and if the phone is held with the top to the right, it takes a video. You can, of course, customize these to your liking.</li><br/>
 	<li><strong>Shortcuts Folder</strong> - Perhaps the simplest way to make use of the Action Button is to set it to show the Shortcuts Folder, a unique action only available to the Action Button. You can set it to show all of your Shortcuts or just your favorites, so when you press the Action Button, you get a menu with your most useful Shortcuts. To set this up, open up the Settings app, choose Action Button, swipe over to Shortcut, tap on Choose a Shortcut... then select Show Folder and choose your preferred folder.</li><br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Three days after Apple said that it <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/30/apple-responds-to-iphone-15-pro-overheating/">would release a software update</a> with a fix for a bug contributing to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/28/iphone-15-pro-overheating-reports/">iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max overheating</a>, <em>MacRumors</em> can confirm that Apple is now internally testing iOS 17.0.3.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/iOS-17.0.3-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-915213" /><br/>
It's unclear when iOS 17.0.3 will be released to the public, but the update will likely be available either later this week or next week.<br/>
<br/>
Apple did not provide any specific details about the bug that it identified, but it said that it will not be reducing the performance of the A17 Pro chip with its planned software update. Apple also said the iPhone 15 Pro's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/30/apple-iphone-15-pro-overheating-details/">titanium frame is not to blame</a>, so it appears that the overheating issues are not the result of hardware deficiencies.<br/>
<br/>
The same bug fix should eventually be included in iOS 17.1, which is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/03/apple-seeds-ios-17-1-beta-2-to-developers/">currently in beta</a> and is expected to be released in late October.<br/>
<br/>
Apple added that the overheating issues were also related to some apps overloading the A17 Pro chip, including Instagram, Uber, and racing game Asphalt 9: Legends. Apple said it was working with the developers of these apps to address the situation. Instagram already released an app update with a fix on Wednesday. Uber also updated its app today, but whether it addresses this issue remains to be determined.<br/>
<br/>
Not all iPhone 15 Pro users have experienced overheating, and it's unclear how many users have been impacted by the issue, but it should be fixed soon.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-17/">iPadOS 17</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-15-Pro">iPhone 15 Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-17.241">iOS 17</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-17.242">iPadOS 17</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/03/apple-preparing-ios-17-0-3/">Apple Preparing iOS 17.0.3, Likely With Bug Fix for iPhone 15 Pro Overheating Issue</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-preparing-ios-17-0-3-likely-with-bug-fix-for-iphone-15-pro-overheating-issue.2406150/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

Double Tap lets Apple Watch users double tap an index finger and thumb together to interact with the Apple Watch using one hand. The sensors in the Apple Watch are able to detect the fine movements, registering it as a tap on the display.<br/>
<br/>
The Double Tap gesture can be used to perform single-tap actions such as answering or ending a phone call, stopping a timer, playing and pausing music, snoozing or turning off an alarm, and more.<br/>
<br/>
Because Double Tap is enabled through the S9 chip in the &zwnj;Apple Watch Series 9&zwnj; and Apple Watch Ultra, it is a feature that is limited to these models.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/watchos-10/">watchOS 10</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-programming.135">Apple Programming</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/03/watchos-10-1-double-tap-support/">watchOS 10.1 Beta 2 Adds Support for Double Tap</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/watchos-10-1-beta-2-adds-support-for-double-tap.2406141/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today seeded the fourth beta of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/visionos/">visionOS</a>, the software that runs on the upcoming Vision Pro headset. The third beta <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/29/apple-releases-third-visionos-beta/">came out in late August</a>, so it has been more than a month since Apple last released a &zwnj;visionOS&zwnj; update.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-898552" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/Apple-Vision-Pro-with-battery-Feature-Orange.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" /><br/>
Only a limited number of developers have access to Vision Pro at this time, with the headsets used for app testing purposes. Most people will not have access to the &zwnj;visionOS&zwnj; beta outside of Xcode, and it is not yet clear what Apple is adding in each &zwnj;visionOS&zwnj; update.<br/>
<br/>
Apple is allowing developers to attend Vision Pro labs around the world, and developers who visit these locations are able to test the Vision Pro in person and get help from Apple engineers on their &zwnj;visionOS&zwnj; apps.<br/>
<br/>
The Vision Pro headset is not expected until early 2024, so Apple still has a lot of work to do on both hardware and software. We are expecting either this beta or a beta shortly after to introduce the official &zwnj;visionOS&zwnj; <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a> that Apple has been working on.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/visionos/">visionOS</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-vision-pro.209">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/03/apple-releases-visionos-beta-4/">Apple Continues Refining visionOS With Fourth Beta Release</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-continues-refining-visionos-with-fourth-beta-release.2406138/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today seeded the second betas of iOS 17.1 and iPadOS 17.1 to developers for testing purposes, with the beta coming one week after Apple released the first betas of iOS 17.1 and iPadOS 17.1.<br/>

Registered developers are able to opt into the betas by opening up the Settings app, going to the Software Update section, tapping on the "Beta Updates" option, and toggling on the ‌<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a> or <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-17/">iPadOS 17</a>‌ Developer Beta. An <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-id/">Apple ID</a> associated with a developer account is required to download and install the beta.<br/>
<br/>
iOS 17.1 adds the option to favorite songs, albums, playlists, artists, and more, with favorited content added to the Library and used for suggestions. Favoriting can be done from the Lock Screen using the Now Playing widget, plus when starting a playlist, you'll now see Song Suggestions.<br/>
<br/>
AirDrop transfers can be finished over the internet so close proximity does not need to be maintained, and an Apple Watch running watchOS 10.1 can now use NameDrop with an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> running iOS 17.1.<br/>
<br/>
Other new features include a flashlight indicator in the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/dynamic-island/">Dynamic Island</a> for non <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a> models, and a Wallet feature that lets those in the UK connect their banks to see balances and transactions.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-17/">iPadOS 17</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-17.241">iOS 17</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-17.242">iPadOS 17</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/03/apple-seeds-ios-17-1-beta-2-to-developers/">Apple Seeds Second Betas of iOS 17.1 and iPadOS 17.1 to Developers</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-seeds-second-betas-of-ios-17-1-and-ipados-17-1-to-developers.2406134/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

<br/>

Registered developers can opt-in to the beta through the Software Update section of the System Settings app. Under Beta updates, simply toggle on the Sonoma Developer Beta. Note that an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-id/">Apple ID</a> associated with an Apple Developer account is required to get the beta.<br/>
<br/>
&zwnj;macOS Sonoma&zwnj; 14.1 includes updates for the Music app, introducing an option to favorite songs, albums, artists, and more. No other major new additions have been found in the beta as of yet, but there are several promised features that did not make it into the &zwnj;macOS Sonoma&zwnj; launch.<br/>
<br/>
Apple says that these features are coming in an update later this year, so we could begin seeing some of them in this beta.<br/>
<br/>
Additions we are waiting on include interactive Music widgets, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/icloud/">iCloud</a> Sync improvements, the option to use Stickers through the Tapback menu in Messages, Intelligent form detection and Enhanced AutoFill for PDF documents and forms, an option to complete words by pressing the space bar, collaborative playlists in the Music app, and a favorite songs playlist.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sonoma/">macOS Sonoma</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macos-sonoma.243">macOS Sonoma</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/03/apple-seeds-macos-sonoma-14-1-beta-2/">Apple Seeds Second Beta of macOS Sonoma 14.1 to Developers</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-seeds-second-beta-of-macos-sonoma-14-1-to-developers.2406130/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

Registered developers are able to download the tvOS 17 update by opting in to the beta through the Settings app on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a>. A registered developer account is required.<br/>
<br/>
tvOS updates are often minor in scale compared to other operating system updates, focusing primarily on bug fixes and smaller improvements rather than notable outward-facing changes. tvOS 17.1 adds a new favoriting option to the Music app on the &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
Apple shares some information on tvOS releases in its <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207936">tvOS support document</a>, which is updated after each tvOS launch, but Apple does not provide notes during beta testing.<br/>
<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Starting with the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/28/apple-seeds-ios-17-1-public-beta-1/">first iOS 17.1 beta</a> released last week, Reachability <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/iOSBeta/comments/16u283t/ios_171_db1_reachability_now_uses_a_pure_black/">now has a solid black background</a> on all iPhone models with the Dynamic Island, instead of a blurred view of the device's wallpaper. This minor change means the Dynamic Island no longer appears twice on the screen when Reachability is being used.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/ios-17-1-reachability.jpg" alt="" width="1363" height="767" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-915195" /><div class="center-wrap"><em>Image Credit: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/iOSBeta/comments/16u283t/ios_171_db1_reachability_now_uses_a_pure_black/">throwmeaway1784</a></em></div><br/>
iPhone models with the Dynamic Island include the iPhone 14 Pro, iPhone 14 Pro Max, iPhone 15, iPhone 15 Plus, iPhone 15 Pro, and iPhone 15 Pro Max.<br/>
<br/>
On older iPhone models without the Dynamic Island, Reachability still shows a blurred wallpaper as the background on the first iOS 17.1 beta.<br/>
<br/>
Reachability is an optional feature that lowers the top half of the screen so it's within easy reach of your fingers. The feature can be enabled in the Settings app under Accessibility → Touch → Reachability. To use the feature, simply swipe down on the bottom edge of the screen. To return to a regular view, tap the upper half of the screen.<br/>
<br/>
iOS 17.1 is expected to be released in late October. Last week, we outlined <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/27/ios-17-1-beta-1-features/">other new features in the first beta</a> for Apple Music, AirDrop, and more.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-17/">iPadOS 17</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/reachability/">Reachability</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-17.241">iOS 17</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-17.242">iPadOS 17</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/03/ios-17-1-beta-reachability-black-background/">iOS 17.1 Beta Gives Reachability a Black Background on iPhones With Dynamic Island</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-17-1-beta-gives-reachability-a-black-background-on-iphones-with-dynamic-island.2406120/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple may be proceeding with plans to release a new Mac model this month, according to potentially related information obtained by <em>MacRumors</em>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/Apple-Logo-Spotlight.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-912758" /><br/>
Details pertaining to imminent changes to Mac trade-ins provided to <em>MacRumors</em> by a verified source suggest that Apple will likely begin accepting new models for trade-in this month. Similar changes in June coincided with WWDC, when Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/06/05/apple-trade-ins-mac-studio-m2-macboook-air/">began accepting</a> trade-ins of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-studio/">Mac Studio</a>, 13-inch <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m2/">M2</a> <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/">MacBook Air</a>, and 13-inch &zwnj;M2&zwnj; MacBook Pro for credit towards new Apple product purchases. Apple simultaneously launched the 15-inch &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj;, second-generation &zwnj;Mac Studio&zwnj;, and Apple silicon <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-pro/">Mac Pro</a>. As such, it seems plausible that a similar, albeit smaller, expansion of the Macs Apple accepts for trade-in this month may correlate with the launch of at least one new machine around mid-October.<br/>
<br/>
In July, <em>Bloomberg</em>'s <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a> said October of this year could see the announcement of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/07/17/apple-m3-macs-october-event/">first Macs with the M3 chip</a>. He said that the 13-inch &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj;, 13-inch MacBook Pro, and 24-inch <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/">iMac</a> are all candidates for potential release this month.<br/>
<br/>
The as-yet-unannounced M3 chip is widely expected to be fabricated with TSMC's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/3nm/">3nm</a> process for performance and power efficiency improvements compared to the current 5nm-based &zwnj;M2&zwnj; chip, which debuted in June 2022. It will also likely feature an all new GPU with hardware ray-tracing, first introduced on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a>'s A17 Pro chip last month.<br/>
<br/>
In September, Apple analyst <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/">Ming-Chi Kuo</a> said that it seemed Apple will <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/08/kuo-first-m3-macbooks-unlikely-2023/">not launch new MacBook models</a> with M3 series chips before the end of this year. This may mean that the most likely Mac to be announced is a refreshed 24-inch &zwnj;iMac&zwnj; with the M3 chip. The current model featuring the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m1/">M1</a> chip has now been on sale for over two and a half years.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/03/trade-in-changes-may-indicate-new-mac-this-month/">Mac Trade-In Changes May Indicate New Model to Launch This Month</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/mac-trade-in-changes-may-indicate-new-model-to-launch-this-month.2406100/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

The refurbished models are priced at &#36;249, down from &#36;299 for a brand new model.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/01/HomePod-2-Midnight-Closeup-Feature-Blue-Orange.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-881768" /><br/>
Apple began selling refurbished HomePods <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/02/apple-refurbished-homepod-2-select-countries/">in the U.K., Australia, Japan, and many other countries</a> last week. Availability has yet to begin in Canada.<br/>
<br/>
Apple says its refurbished HomePods undergo full functionality testing, and they are inspected, cleaned, and repackaged in a plain white box with the power cord and documentation. The refurbished HomePods are covered by Apple's limited one-year warranty policy, and they are eligible for extended AppleCare+ coverage.<br/>
<br/>
The second-generation HomePod has a similar design as the original HomePod that was discontinued in 2021, but with a larger backlit touch surface, two fewer tweeters, two fewer microphones, an indoor temperature and humidity sensor, and a few other changes.

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/microled-apple-watch/">microLED Apple Watch</a> is on track to launch in late 2025, according to Jeff Pu, a tech analyst at Hong Kong investment firm Haitong International Securities.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/09/apple-watch-ultra-1-1.jpg" alt="" width="3840" height="2160" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-866346" /><br/>
In a note to investors seen by <em>MacRumors</em>, Pu said that the first Apple Watch with a microLED display will launch in late 2025. The advanced display technology offers improved brightness, color reproduction, and viewing angles, making images look more like they are "painted" atop the glass.<br/>
<br/>
Yesterday, a Weibo leaker reported that the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/02/next-major-apple-watch-upgrade-to-be-microled/">next worthwhile upgrade</a> for the Apple Watch Ultra users will be Apple's custom microLED display technology. Apple's plan to bring a microLED display to the Apple Watch Ultra is very widely corroborated, starting with a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/01/10/microled-apple-watch-2025/">report</a> from display analyst Ross Young in January.<br/>
<br/>
After initially placing the device's launch in 2024, Young moved his forecast to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/27/apple-watch-ultra-second-half-2025/">second-half of 2025</a>. <em>Bloomberg</em>, on the other hand, reported a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/01/10/apple-custom-displays-microled-apple-watch/">2024 time frame</a> earlier this year. TrendForce <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/07/04/apple-watch-ultra-microled-delayed-early-2026/">claims</a> that Apple's first microLED display will launch on a new Apple Watch Ultra model in 2026, due to supply chain adjustments. With Young and Pu, as well as leaks on Weibo, now pointing to a launch in 2025, the &zwnj;microLED Apple Watch&zwnj; Ultra may launch sooner than previously expected.<br/>
<br/>
The microLED display is expected to be 2.12-inches in size, a 10% increase over the display of the current Apple Watch Ultra. <em>Bloomberg</em>'s <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a> <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/01/15/apple-custom-displays-heading-to-iphone-ipad-and-mac-after-apple-watch/">reported</a> Apple is likely planning to bring custom microLED displays to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>, and Mac after the technology debuts in a new version of the Apple Watch Ultra. He believes Apple's long-term plan is to bring microLED displays to all of its key products. Other reports from <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/10/microled-iphone-report/"><em>DigiTimes</em></a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/18/apple-mass-produce-microled-iphone/"><em>Nikkei Asia</em></a>, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/06/apple-microled-struggle-led-to-reliance-on-samsung/"><em>The Information</em></a> have indicated similar plans for Apple to transition to custom microLED displays across multiple product lines in an effort to become less <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/06/apple-microled-struggle-led-to-reliance-on-samsung/">reliant on Samsung</a>.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch-ultra/">Apple Watch Ultra 2</a></div><div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/micro-led/">Micro-LED</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/jeff-pu/">Jeff Pu</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/microled-apple-watch/">microLED Apple Watch</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch_Ultra">Apple Watch Ultra (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-watch.172">Apple Watch</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/03/microled-apple-watch-still-on-track-for-2025/">MicroLED Apple Watch Still on Track for Late 2025 Launch</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/microled-apple-watch-still-on-track-for-late-2025-launch.2406087/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>
