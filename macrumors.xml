		<description><![CDATA[Two years after Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/07/19/apple-butterfly-keyboard-lawsuit-settlement/">paid &#36;50 million to settle a class-action lawsuit</a> over faulty MacBook butterfly keyboards, funds from the settlement will be going out to affected customers.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-790219" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/03/macbook-pro-butterfly-keyboard.jpg" alt="" width="1955" height="1100" /><br/>
An update on the <a href="https://www.keyboardsettlement.com">MacBook Keyboard Litigation Settlement website</a> says that the court issued a payment order on June 27, 2024, with payments set to be issued for approved claims by August 2024.<br/>
<br/>
Emails about the lawsuit were sent out in December 2022 to MacBook owners eligible for a payment. MacBook owners who had at least two topcase replacements from Apple within four years of purchase are set to receive a maximum of &#36;395, while customers who had one topcase repair will receive up to &#36;125. Those who had keycap replacements are eligible for up to &#36;50.<br/>
<br/>
Claims were accepted through March 6, 2023, and the settlement was ultimately approved on May 25, 2023. There is no word on why there has been more than a year's delay getting payments sent out to customers.<br/>
<br/>
Apple used butterfly keyboards in Macs between 2015 and 2019, and while the design was updated several times during that four-year period, the butterfly mechanism was prone to failure. Thousands of customers had issues with repeating keys, sticking keys, and keyboard failures due to crumbs, dust, and other issues.<br/>
<br/>
Apple launched <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2018/06/22/apple-macbook-pro-keyboard-repair-program/">a repair program</a> in June 2018 covering the MacBook, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/">MacBook Air</a>, and MacBook Pro models manufactured from 2015 on, but it only covered machines for four years after purchase and because butterfly keyboards were replaced with another butterfly keyboard, no permanent fix was available.<br/>
<br/>
Due to the major failure of the butterfly keyboard, Apple swapped back to a scissor switch mechanism. Macs manufactured since late 2019 have had the much more reliable scissor switch keyboard that is able to stand up to wear and tear.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/butterfly-keyboard-issues/">Butterfly Keyboard Issues</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/01/macbook-pro-butterfly-keyboard-payout/">MacBook Owners With Faulty Butterfly Keyboards to Get Payouts Soon</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/macbook-owners-with-faulty-butterfly-keyboards-to-get-payouts-soon.2430485/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

Registered developers are able to opt into the betas by opening up the Settings app, going to the Software Update section, tapping on the "Beta Updates" option, and toggling on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a> or <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-17/">iPadOS 17</a> Developer Beta.

The features Apple promised for &zwnj;iOS 17&zwnj; have all been implemented, so it is not clear what will be included in iOS 17.6, and no major new additions were discovered in the first beta.<br/>

tvOS software releases are usually minor in scale compared to other operating system updates, focusing primarily on smaller improvements rather than outward-facing changes. We don't yet know what's included in tvOS 17.6.<br/>
<br/>
Apple shares some information on tvOS releases in its <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207936">tvOS support document</a>, which is updated after each tvOS launch, but Apple does not provide notes during beta testing.<br/>

		<title>iPhone and Apple Watch Likely to Support NFC Multi-Purpose Tap in the Future</title>

		<description><![CDATA[iPhones and Apple Watches could support multiple actions via NFC simultaneously in the future, the NFC Forum today suggested.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/04/apple-card-via-apple-pay.jpeg" alt="" width="1524" height="909" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-843215" /><br/>
The NFC Forum, the leading standards body for Near Field Communication (NFC) technology, <a href="https://nfc-forum.org/news/2024-07-nfc-forum-defines-next-generation-of-contactless-user-experience-with-multi-purpose-tap/">today published</a> its first overview of NFC Multi-Purpose Tap. The technology, which supports multiple actions with one tap, is designed to bring more convenience to various NFC use cases such as point-to-point receipt delivery, loyalty programs, identification, and total-journey transit ticketing.<br/>
<br/>
Apple is a prominent member of the NFC Forum and likely contributed to the development of the technology. The company first introduced NFC in the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> 6 and original Apple Watch, initially focusing on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-pay/">Apple Pay</a>, allowing users to make contactless payments. <br/>
<br/>
NFC Multi-Purpose Tap would allow &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; users to perform multiple transactions with a single tap. For instance, consumers could make payments, log loyalty points, and receive receipts instantaneously. The potential applications are considerable, from retail payments to public transportation, where users could tap their &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; to pay for a journey, apply discounts, and get travel receipts all at once.<br/>
<br/>
Since Apple is a member of the NFC Forum, it seems highly likely that NFC Multi-Purpose Tap will come to the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; and Apple Watch at some point in the future. The company often adds support for new NFC functionalities, such as reading NFC tags and facilitating more interactions with a broader range of NFC devices. <div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/nfc/">NFC</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/01/iphone-likely-to-support-nfc-multi-purpose-tap/">iPhone and Apple Watch Likely to Support NFC Multi-Purpose Tap in the Future</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-and-apple-watch-likely-to-support-nfc-multi-purpose-tap-in-the-future.2430457/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today reclassified the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> X, first-generation <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod/">HomePod</a>, and first-generation AirPods as "vintage" products.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/03/homepod-feature-blue2.jpg" alt="" width="2144" height="1206" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-788875" /><br/>
The products appeared on Apple's <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/102772">vintage and obsolete products list</a> earlier today. Products are considered vintage when Apple stopped distributing them for sale more than five and less than seven years ago. Apple Stores and Apple Authorized Service Providers continue to offer repairs for vintage products for up to two more years, subject to parts availability.<br/>
<br/>
The &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; X, announced on September 12, 2017 and released on November 3, 2017, represented a significant leap forward in Apple's smartphone design and feature-set. Marking the 10th anniversary of the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;, it introduced several significant changes such as the removal of the home button, allowing for an edge-to-edge 5.8-inch Super Retina OLED display. <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mask-face-id/">Face ID</a>, a facial recognition system, replaced <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/touch-id/">Touch ID</a> for authentication, utilizing a TrueDepth camera system in a "notch" that also enabled Animojis. The &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; X was powered by the A11 Bionic chip, featuring the company's first dedicated Neural Engine for enhanced machine learning capabilities, and it supported wireless charging for the first time. Its stainless steel frame and glass back design marked a return to a more premium aesthetic.<br/>
<br/>
The original &zwnj;HomePod&zwnj; was announced on June 5, 2017, at the Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) and released on February 9, 2018. Initially priced at &#36;349, the &zwnj;HomePod&zwnj; was designed to deliver high-quality audio and integrate closely with Apple's ecosystem, including <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/">Apple Music</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airplay/">AirPlay</a>. It featured a custom-engineered high-excursion woofer and an array of seven beamforming tweeters. The &zwnj;HomePod&zwnj; was powered by the Apple A8 chip, enabling real-time acoustic modeling, audio beamforming, and multi-channel echo cancellation. <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a> came built-in, allowing users to control music playback, manage smart home devices, and access information and services via voice commands.<br/>
<br/>
Apple announced the original AirPods on September 7, 2016 and officially released them on December 13, 2016, with a retail price of &#36;159. The wireless earbuds were groundbreaking due to their seamless integration with Apple's ecosystem, facilitated by the custom-designed W1 chip. The chip enabled effortless pairing with Apple devices, long battery life, and efficient wireless connectivity. The AirPods also featured optical sensors and motion accelerometers, allowing them to detect when they were in the user's ears, automatically pausing playback when removed. Their unusual, compact design, combined with the convenience of a portable charging case, set a new standard for wireless earphones, making them highly popular and influential in the audio accessory market.<br/>

Sometime after becoming "vintage," an Apple product will be reclassified as "obsolete." Apple says it considers a product obsolete once seven years have passed since the company last distributed it for sale. When this happens, Apple Stores and Apple Authorized Service Providers no longer offer repairs or other hardware service for it. <div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods/">AirPods 3</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod/">HomePod</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/vintage-and-obsolete/">Vintage and Obsolete Apple Products</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AirPods">AirPods (Don't Buy)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#HomePod">HomePod (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/airpods.216">AirPods</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99">iPhone</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/01/iphone-x-homepod-and-original-airpods-now-vintage/">Apple Reclassifies iPhone X, HomePod, and Original AirPods as &#039;Vintage&#039;</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-reclassifies-iphone-x-homepod-and-original-airpods-as-vintage.2430454/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Epic Games says it has <a href="https://x.com/epicnewsroom/status/1806819627181219995">submitted</a> the Epic Games Store to Apple for notarization under Apple's alternative app marketplace policy in the European Union.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/08/fortnite-apple-logo-2.5.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="720" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-756080" /><br/>
The ‌Epic Games‌ Store will include popular game Fortnite, which means ‌iPhone‌ users in the EU will be able to install and play the title without having to use a cloud gaming service. Epic said it was "targeting the next couple months for the store and Fortnite on iOS in the EU." An ‌iPad‌ version of Fortnite is expected to follow this year.<br/>
<br/>
Fortnite has been banned from the iOS App Store for the last several years due to the legal dispute between Apple and ‌Epic Games‌. An avenue for its return was only made possible after Apple made it possible for iPhone‌ users in the EU to download apps from alternative app marketplaces rather than the App Store, as well as directly from developer websites.<br/>
<br/>
Apple is charging a 0.50 euro Core Technology Fee per year for apps installed outside of the ‌App Store‌ (and in the ‌App Store‌ for developers who opt in to the new terms and also still choose to use Apple's system), but there are no ‌App Store‌ commissions or in-app fees. While Apple is waiving fees for the first one million installs, the 0.50 per user fee will cost app developers like ‌Epic Games‌ a notable amount of money, especially given that Epic will often be charged twice – once for its app marketplace and once again for every Fortnite install. <br/>
<br/>
Epic CEO Tim Sweeney has been critical of Apple's App Store changes to bring its policies in line with the Digital Markets Act (DMA). Sweeney has <a href="https://x.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1750589570880516402">described</a> the changes as a "devious new instance of malicious compliance," and called Apple's charges "junk fees." The European Commission last week formally announced its preliminary view that <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/24/eu-accuses-apple-violating-dma-rules/">Apple's App Store policies are in breach of the DMA</a>. The Commission also said it would open a new non-compliance procedure against Apple over concerns that its contractual requirements for third-party app developers and app marketplaces, including its Core Technology Fee, "fall short of ensuring effective compliance with Apple's obligations under the DMA."<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/european-union/">European Union</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/epic-games/">Epic Games</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/epic-games-vs-apple/">Epic Games vs. Apple</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/01/fortnite-epic-game-store-submitted-apple/">Fortnite and Epic Games Store Submitted to Apple for iOS Launch in EU</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/fortnite-and-epic-games-store-submitted-to-apple-for-ios-launch-in-eu.2430446/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Google will refresh its product lineup this year in the middle of August rather than its usual October timing, which means its latest flagship Pixel smartphones will debut ahead of Apple's annual iPhone upgrade cycle for the first time.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/google-pixel-announcements.jpg" alt="" width="2060" height="1159" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-915310" /><div class="center-wrap"><em>Google Pixel 8 series</em></div><br/>
Google last week began sending out media invitations to an August 13 hardware event that will "showcase the base of Google AI, Android software and the Pixel portfolio of devices." Google typically holds its annual Made by Google event in early October to unveil its latest Pixel phones, smartwatches, and Nest-branded devices. <br/>
<br/>
Rumors indicate Google will launch three devices in its forthcoming Pixel 9 lineup, with a new larger 6.2-inch Pixel 9 Pro XL device joining the regular Pixel 9 and Pixel 9 Pro. Leaks suggest the Pixel 9 Pro will have a triple rear camera setup. Google is also expected to launch Android 15 touting Gemini AI enhancements and other services. <br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Get ready for magic at <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/MadeByGoogle?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#MadeByGoogle</a> <br><br>Learn more and sign up for updates: <a href="https://t.co/ZnBcg6S6vK">https://t.co/ZnBcg6S6vK</a> <a href="https://t.co/C6Of1L9g4a">pic.twitter.com/C6Of1L9g4a</a></p>&mdash; Made by Google (@madebygoogle) <a href="https://twitter.com/madebygoogle/status/1805713788416434332?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 25, 2024</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div><br/>
Alongside new phones, Google is expected to release a Pixel Fold 2 tablet, a Pixel Watch 3 series, and new Pixel earbuds, all of which will compete with Apple devices. The decision to bring forward the hardware upgrades was likely made with one eye on Apple's hardware launches in September, when the iPhone 16 and Apple Watch Series 9 are expected to be revealed alongside iOS 18 with Apple Intelligence.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/google/">Google</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/01/google-to-unveil-pixel-9-phones-august/">Google to Unveil Pixel 9 Phones Next Month Ahead of iPhone 16 Launch</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/google-to-unveil-pixel-9-phones-next-month-ahead-of-iphone-16-launch.2430443/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple eventually plans to turn some of its artificial intelligence features into paid services, similar to iCloud+ subscriptions, according to <em>Bloomberg</em> reporter Mark Gurman.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/Apple-Intelligence-General-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-956491" /><br/>
Writing in his latest <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-06-30/apple-s-longer-lasting-devices-ios-19-and-apple-intelligence-on-the-vision-pro-ly1jnrw4">Power On newsletter</a>, Gurman said that while Apple Intelligence will be free to start, Apple's long-term plan is to launch something like "Apple Intelligence+," with extra features that users pay monthly fees to access.<br/>
<br/>
Making its own AI features another services revenue stream should allow Apple to compensate for the slowing pace of hardware upgrades and make the company less reliant on hardware tweaks to drive its business, argues Gurman. <br/>
<br/>
Apple is also expected to receive a cut of revenue whenever a user signs up to features offered by its AI partners, such as ChatGPT provided by OpenAI. Gurman says he expects Apple to agree a deal with Google and Anthropic to offer their AI services through its devices, with the former expected to be announced when Apple Intelligence launches in the fall as part of iOS 18, iPadOS 18, and macOS Sequoia.<br/>
<br/>
<em>Bloomberg</em> previously reported that Apple has <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/24/apple-meta-ai-privacy-concerns/">turned down</a> an AI partnership with Facebook parent company Meta due to privacy concerns. Meanwhile, Apple is said to be <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/21/apple-ai-partner-china/">seeking partnerships for the Chinese market</a>, where ChatGPT and other similar AI services are not available. <div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/bloomberg-com/">Bloomberg</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/">Apple Intelligence</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/01/apple-intelligence-features-likely-paid-sub/">Some Apple Intelligence Features Likely to Require Paid Subscription</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/some-apple-intelligence-features-likely-to-require-paid-subscription.2430439/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The upcoming iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max will be the first Apple smartphones to adopt Samsung's high performance "M14" OLED display panel, claims a new report coming out of South Korea.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/iPhone-16-Pro-Front-Update-Blue.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-953750" /><br/>
According to <em><a href="https://www.etnews.com/20240628000294">ETNews</a></em>, Samsung's "M" series of OLED panels are made for flagship smartphones, while "14" refers to the number of high-performance materials used to produce them. "M14" is the first series of its kind, and the panel is said to have been developed to deliver superior brightness and longevity.<br/>
<br/>
Samsung has reportedly placed orders for the M14 materials and is preparing to mass produce the displays in the second half of the year for Apple's iPhone 16 Pro models. Google's Pixel 9 smartphone is the only other device that is expected to adopt the high-performance displays in 2024.<br/>
<br/>
A previous report out of China <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/10/iphone-16-pro-brighter-display/">claimed</a> that this year's ‌iPhone 16 Pro‌ models will feature up to 1,200 nits of typical SDR brightness – a 20% increase over the current models – so Samsung's new panel could be the reason for the expected improvement. That said, peak HDR brightness is expected to remain at 1,600 nits, the same as the current iPhone 15 Pro Display.<br/>
<br/>
Another rumor last year suggested that all iPhone 16 models will adopt new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/01/iphone-16-oled-displays-micro-lens-efficiency/">micro-lens OLED display technology</a> for improved brightness and reduced power consumption, although it's not clear if this is related to M14 panels specifically.<br/>
<br/>
The iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max will have <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/29/iphone-16-preliminary-weights-dimensions/">larger display sizes</a> than the iPhone 15 Pro models, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/16/iphone-16-display-sizes/">according to multiple sources</a>. The iPhone 16 Pro will have a display that's 6.27 inches in size (rounded to 6.3), while the iPhone 16 Pro Max is expected to have a display that's 6.85 inches in size (rounded to 6.9). <br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple is exploring new suppliers for OLED-on-Silicon panels, likely signaling the development of a more affordable headset destined to sit alongside the Vision Pro, <a href="http://www.thelec.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=28806"><em>The Elec</em></a> reports.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/apple-vision-pro-lenses.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-898584" /><br/>
The Korean website has apparently detected a shift in Apple's supply chain management for OLED-on-Silicon (OLEDoS) panels, a key component in the Vision Pro headset. Currently, Sony provides these high-resolution microdisplays, but its limited production capacity of up to 900,000 panels per year and lack of expansion plans have prompted Apple to seek alternatives for the future. Apple has apparently issued a request for information (RFI) to Samsung Display and LG Display to evaluate their capabilities in producing larger OLEDoS panels, ranging from 2.0 to 2.1 inches in size with a display density of around 1,700 pixels per inch (PPI).<br/>
<br/>
These displays would be larger than those currently used in the Vision Pro and feature a lower resolution. The Vision Pro uses Sony's OLEDoS panels featuring a 1.42-inch screen with a pixel density of nearly 3,400 PPI, employing a white OLED display with color filter (wOLED+CF) technology. This sophisticated display technology is one of the main reasons for the headset's high price point.<br/>
<br/>
At Displayweek 2024, both Samsung and LG showcased advancements in OLED microdisplay technology that could appeal to Apple. Samsung presented a 1.03-inch RGB (direct-emission) OLED microdisplay, developed in collaboration with eMagin, which promises higher brightness levels compared to the wOLED+CF method. Meanwhile, LG revealed a 10,000 nits 1.3-inch 4K OLED microdisplay, utilizing a micro lens array (MLA) to boost brightness by around 40 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Apple's interest in larger OLEDoS panels with lower resolution than those used in the Vision Pro suggests these could be intended for a new, lower-cost mixed reality headset. Apple has been rumored to be working on such a device for over a year, and the latest indications suggest that it may be <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/24/cheaper-apple-vision-pro-tethered-iphone-mac/">designed to tether to an iPhone or Mac</a> to eliminate the need for a costly processor. The lower-cost Apple Vision headset could launch as soon as the end of next year.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/oled/">OLED</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/the-elec/">The Elec</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AppleVisionPro">Vision Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-vision-pro.209">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/30/lower-resolution-displays-for-cheaper-headset/">Apple Likely Planning to Use Bigger, Lower Resolution Displays for Cheaper Vision Headset</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-likely-planning-to-use-bigger-lower-resolution-displays-for-cheaper-vision-headset.2430415/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

Writing in his <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-06-30/apple-s-longer-lasting-devices-ios-19-and-apple-intelligence-on-the-vision-pro-ly1jnrw4?srnd=undefined">most recent</a> "Power On" newsletter, Gurman said that Apple has formally begun development of its major operating systems for 2025 with the codenames "Luck" for iOS 19, "Cheer" for macOS 16, "Nepali" for watchOS 12, and "Discovery" for &zwnj;visionOS&zwnj; 3.<br/>
<br/>
While <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a>, macOS 15 Sequoia, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/watchos-11/">watchOS 11</a>, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/visionos-2/">visionOS 2</a> have not yet been released to the public, the initiation of work on the next major software updates for Apple's major devices is in line with its normal schedule. This is partly due to the fact that hardware products destined for launch next year require software for testing purposes, but it is currently too early to know what sort of features the new operating systems will offer.<br/>

Gurman also said that the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/30/gurman-apple-intelligence-coming-to-vision-pro/">Vision Pro headset should gain Apple Intelligence</a> as soon as next year, so this could make sense for &zwnj;visionOS&zwnj; 3.

		<description><![CDATA[A new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> battery with a metal casing should allow for higher energy density to deliver longer battery life, Apple analyst <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/">Ming-Chi Kuo</a> claims. <br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/iphone-16-pro-battery-kosutami.jpg" alt="" width="2048" height="1333" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-923492" /><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/20/iphone-16-pro-leak-reveals-redesigned-battery/"><em>Alleged iPhone 16 Pro battery</a> with new metal casing.</em></div><br/>
In a <a href="https://x.com/mingchikuo/status/1807432542934732953">post on X</a> (formerly Twitter), Kuo said that Apple's adoption of a stainless steel casing for the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;'s battery will allow for five to 10 percent higher cell density while remaining within safety limits, as well as meeting the requirements of new EU regulations. Alleged images of an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/20/iphone-16-pro-leak-reveals-redesigned-battery/">iPhone 16 Pro battery with a metal casing</a> leaked in late 2023 and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/28/new-battery-replacement-method-with-iphone-16/"><em>The Information</em></a> has since detailed Apple's work to simplify &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; battery replacement starting with the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a>.<br/>
<br/>
New EU law requires smartphone manufacturers to ensure batteries can be replaced by owners using easily accessible tools by 2025. Apple plans to achieve this with the use of electrically induced adhesive debonding technology, allowing users to apply a low voltage of electricity to quickly dislodge the battery instead of finicky adhesive strips. This new battery replacement method is anticipated to debut in at least one &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; model later this year and could extend to all versions of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17/">iPhone 17</a> next year.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/">iPhone 16 Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/">Ming-Chi Kuo</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/30/new-iphone-battery-denser-for-longer-life/">New iPhone Battery Should Be Up to 10% Denser for Longer Life</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/new-iphone-battery-should-be-up-to-10-denser-for-longer-life.2430407/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple has no plans to bring Apple Intelligence to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod/">HomePod</a>, but it should arrive on the Vision Pro headset in the future, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-06-30/apple-s-longer-lasting-devices-ios-19-and-apple-intelligence-on-the-vision-pro-ly1jnrw4?srnd=undefined"><em>Bloomberg</em></a>'s <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a> reports.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/Apple-Intelligence-General-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-956491" /><br/>
In the <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-06-30/apple-s-longer-lasting-devices-ios-19-and-apple-intelligence-on-the-vision-pro-ly1jnrw4?srnd=undefined">latest edition</a> of his "Power On" newsletter, Gurman said that Apple is preparing to bring Apple Intelligence to its Vision Pro headset, but not this year. The device has sufficient memory to run on-device Apple Intelligence features such as notification summaries, writing tools, and an updated version of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a>. Apple's user interface design team apparently needs to ensure that Apple Intelligence looks appropriate in a mixed-reality environment. The company also needs to guarantee that it has sufficient cloud-computing capacity to support more devices.<br/>
<br/>
Gurman does not expect the &zwnj;HomePod&zwnj; to offer Apple Intelligence, instead focusing on "an entirely new robotic device with a display that includes Apple Intelligence at its core." Apple Intelligence requires a minimum of eight gigabytes of memory, but the &zwnj;HomePod&zwnj; and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod-mini/">HomePod mini</a> only feature a single gigabyte of memory. The current &zwnj;HomePod&zwnj; is said to be "too low-volume a product to waste the engineering time" bringing Apple Intelligence to the device.<br/>
<br/>
Going forward, Gurman believes that Apple Intelligence will become increasingly critical to Apple devices and form a pillar of its business. Apple Intelligence should get updated more frequently than services like <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/icloud/">iCloud</a>, at least as often as the company's hardware and software offerings. <div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod/">HomePod</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod-mini/">HomePod mini</a></div><div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/bloomberg-com/">Bloomberg</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/">Apple Intelligence</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AppleVisionPro">Vision Pro (Buy Now)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#HomePod">HomePod (Buy Now)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Homepod-Mini">HomePod Mini (Neutral)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-vision-pro.209">Apple Vision Pro</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/homepod-homekit-carplay-home-auto-technology.193">HomePod, HomeKit, CarPlay, Home & Auto Technology</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/30/gurman-apple-intelligence-coming-to-vision-pro/">Gurman: Apple Intelligence Coming to Vision Pro, but Not HomePod</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/gurman-apple-intelligence-coming-to-vision-pro-but-not-homepod.2430404/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple will launch new AirPods featuring infrared cameras to improve spatial experiences with the Vision Pro headset, according to Apple analyst <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/">Ming-Chi Kuo</a>. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/airpods-vision-pro.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-931501" /><br/>
In a <a href="https://medium.com/@mingchikuo/配備ir相機的新款airpods可望提升人機交互體驗與強化apple空間音訊-空間運算生態-new-ir-camera-equipped-airpods-to-enhance-2daa96913d7f">post on Medium</a>, Kuo explained that Apple plans to mass-produce new AirPods with integrated IR camera modules by 2026. These IR cameras will apparently be similar to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>'s <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mask-face-id/">Face ID</a> receiver. <br/>
<br/>
The purpose of IR cameras on AirPods is related to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a> and future headsets from the company, enhancing the spatial computing and audio experience. The IR cameras can detect environmental image changes, facilitating a broader range of gestures to improve user interaction. For example, if a user watches a video using &zwnj;Apple Vision Pro&zwnj; and the new AirPods, and turns their head to look in a specific direction, the sound source in that direction can be "emphasized to enhance the spatial audio/computing experience."<br/>
<br/>
Foxconn is said to be the supplier of the new IR component, with the Taiwanese electronics manufacturer preparing to provide enough parts for about 10 million AirPods initially. It is not clear which AirPods model is likely to get the feature first, but the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/">AirPods Pro</a> may be most likely since they already offer lossless audio exclusively with the Vision Pro.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple is moving right along on iOS 18, macOS Sequoia, and other new operating systems that were unveiled at WWDC earlier this month, releasing the second developer betas of the updates this week with a number of new changes and additions. Public betas will follow sometime next month ahead of a full public release in the fall.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/top-stories-29jun2024.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-957255" /><br/>
Other news and rumors this week included international availability of the Vision Pro headset, upcoming expansion of support for third-party display and battery replacement parts for iPhones, the debut of a revamped Beats Pill speaker, and more, so read on below for all the details!<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Everything New in iOS 18 Beta 2</h2><br/>
Apple this week seeded the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/24/apple-seeds-ios-18-beta-2-to-developers/">second betas of iOS 18</a>, iPadOS 18, macOS Sequoia, watchOS 11, and more to developers for testing. A handful of changes have been discovered on the iPhone in the second iOS 18 beta, as <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/24/everything-new-in-ios-18-beta-2/">outlined in our list of everything new</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/Generic-iOS-18-Feature-Real-Mock.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-954594" /><br/>
The first public beta of iOS 18 will be <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/10/ios-18-macos-sequoia-public-betas/">released at some point in July</a>, according to Apple. However, anyone with a free Apple developer account is able to install the developer beta, as a &#36;99/year Apple Developer Program membership is no longer required for this purpose. As always, make sure to back up your device before installing beta software.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Apple Vision Pro Launches in China, Hong Kong, Japan, and Singapore</h2><br/>
Availability of Apple Vision Pro has <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/28/apple-vision-pro-launches-china-japan-singapore/">expanded beyond the United States for the first time</a>, with the headset now availabile in China, Hong Kong, Japan, and Singapore. <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/28/apple-store-down-uk-canada-vision-pro/">Pre-orders have also gone live</a> in Australia, Canada, France, Germany, and the United Kingdom ahead of a July 12 launch in those countries.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/Apple-Vision-Pro-availability-Wangfujing-Beijing-first-purchase.jpg" alt="" width="1960" height="1306" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-957191" /><br/>
During WWDC earlier this month, Apple announced visionOS 2, the first major update to the Vision Pro's operating system. visionOS 2 includes several new features and changes, including a redesigned Photos app with SharePlay support, the ability to turn existing 2D photos into spatial photos, a larger ultra-wide version of Mac Virtual Display that is equivalent to two 4K monitors side by side, plus support for a physical mouse.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Apple Says iPhones Will Better Support Third-Party Displays and Batteries Later This Year</h2><br/>
Apple this week published a lengthy whitepaper that highlights the company's approach to device repairability and longevity. In the document, Apple revealed that iPhones will <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/26/iphone-third-party-display-battery-support/">better support third-party displays and batteries later in 2024</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/iPhone-15-General-Feature-Black.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-912514" /><br/>
More specifically, Apple said third-party iPhone displays will support True Tone, while battery health metrics will be visible when a third-party battery is installed. However, Apple said it cannot guarantee that the features will work properly.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Beats Pill Speaker Makes a Comeback With Improved Sound, Water Resistance, and Lower Price</h2><br/>
Over two and a half years after Apple discontinued the Beats Pill, the company has <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/25/beats-pill-bluetooth-speaker-announced/">brought the portable Bluetooth speaker back to life</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/beats-pill-1.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-956811" /><br/>
<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/25/beats-pill-bluetooth-speaker-announced/">The new Beats Pill</a> features improved sound, water resistance, a lower &#36;149.99 price, an optional lanyard, Find My support, and other enhancements compared to the previous version. The speaker comes in three colors, and is available to order now on Apple's online store.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>iOS 18 to Bring These 5 New Features to AirPods Pro</h2><br/>
The upcoming iOS 18 update for the iPhone <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/26/ios-18-new-features-airpods-pro/">includes five notable new features for the AirPods Pro</a>, with more details outlined <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/26/ios-18-new-features-airpods-pro/">in our list</a>.<br/>
<br/>

One particular feature that Apple showed off during its WWDC 2024 keynote was hands-free Siri interactions. With the second-generation AirPods Pro and iOS 18, you can <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/10/head-gestures-airpods-pro-later-this-year/">gently nod your head "yes" or gently shake your head "no"</a> to accept or decline an incoming call, without having to speak.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>iPhone 13 Pro vs. iPhone 16 Pro: 60+ Upgrades to Expect</h2><br/>
While the iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max have yet to be announced, there are already <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/">many new features and changes rumored</a> for the devices.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/iPhone-13-Pro-vs-16-Pro-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-956610" /><br/>

Apple's Vision Pro headset is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/28/apple-store-down-uk-canada-vision-pro/">now available</a> to pre-order in Australia, Canada, France, Germany, and the United Kingdom, with availability beginning Friday, July 12. The device also <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/28/apple-vision-pro-launches-china-japan-singapore/">launched today</a> in China, Hong Kong, Japan, and Singapore. It has been available in the United States since February. We discuss key considerations when buying the Vision Pro, such as storage configurations and accessories, as well as the significance of the device's long-awaited rollout around the world. We also look to the future with Apple's rumored low-cost Vision headset, which may <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/24/cheaper-apple-vision-pro-tethered-iphone-mac/">rely on a tethered iPhone</a> for processing power to reduce costs. <br/>
<br/>
In addition, we discuss Apple's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/25/beats-pill-bluetooth-speaker-announced/">new Beats Pill Bluetooth speaker</a>, featuring a completely redesigned speaker system consisting of a single tweeter and a single racetrack woofer, a removable lanyard, USB-C and Bluetooth connectivity, 24 hours of battery life, and IP67 water and sweat resistance. <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/the-macrumors-show/">The MacRumors Show</a> has <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@themacrumorsshow">its own YouTube channel</a>, so make sure you're subscribed to keep up with new episodes and clips:<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Accessory company <a href="https://alogic.co/?ref=y2uwzwu">Alogic</a> recently launched a few new input devices with Mac support as part of its Echelon series, and I've been spending some time testing out the <a href="https://alogic.co/products/echelon-usb-c-rechargeable-wireless-keyboard-for-macos/?ref=y2uwzwu">USB-C Rechargeable Wireless Keyboard for macOS</a> and the <a href="https://alogic.co/products/echelon-usb-c-rechargeable-wireless-mouse-white/?ref=y2uwzwu">USB-C Rechargeable Wireless Mouse</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/alogic-echelon-keyboard-mouse.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-957182" /><br/>
The Echelon series is a budget-friendly line of accessories, seeking to offer a mid-range feature set at value pricing, and the mouse and keyboard do just that. The keyboard is priced at &#36;59.99 and the mouse at &#36;24.99, with Alogic frequently running promotional discounts of around 20% to bring prices down even further.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Echelon USB-C Rechargeable Wireless Keyboard for macOS</h2><br/>
<a href="https://alogic.co/products/echelon-usb-c-rechargeable-wireless-keyboard-for-macos/?ref=y2uwzwu">Alogic's keyboard</a> offers a full-size 109-key layout with function row and number pad. The membrane-style keyboard with chiclet keys has some similarities to Apple's Magic Keyboard for Mac, though you obviously don't have an option for an integrated <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/touch-id/">Touch ID</a> key with Alogic's offering. I've found the keys to be well spaced to allow for smooth typing, and have not experienced any problems with missing keystrokes, double letters, or other issues.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/alogic-echelon-keyboard-front.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-957186" /><br/>
The Echelon keyboard offers a traditional extended keyboard layout, optimized for Mac with key arrangement and labels such as Command. The function keys in the top row include most of the usual Mac-specific functions such as display brightness controls, Spotlight, Mission Control, Launchpad, media playback controls, mute, volume controls, and even one to jump straight to your home folder when you're in Finder. There's also a dedicated system sleep key in that top row. In the bottom row, there's another dedicated key that will open up your Downloads folder when Finder is active. <br/>
<br/>
At the far right of the keyboard is the number pad, which includes the usual layout of number and arithmetic keys, plus a top row that serves double duty for switching among paired devices and as dedicated keys for select all, cut, copy, and paste.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/alogic-echelon-keyboard-rear.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="500" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-957224" /><br/>
Unlike Apple's Magic Keyboard which inexplicably still uses Lightning to charge, Alogic's Echelon keyboard charges over USB-C, and a white braided USB-C to USB-C cable is included in the box. Alogic says the battery lasts "weeks" between charges, but the battery level on my unit has barely dropped at all after several days of heavy usage, so I'm expecting charge intervals to be on the order of a couple of months, similar to what I see with the Magic Keyboard.<br/>
<br/>
It is worth noting that Alogic's keyboard goes to sleep within a few minutes of going idle, even if the computer it's connected to remains active, and you'll need to hit a key on it and wait a beat for the keyboard to wake up before you can begin typing. That took a little getting used to for me given my long-term experience with the Magic Keyboard that pretty much always seems to be ready to go.<br/>
<br/>
The Alogic keyboard easily connects to Apple devices over Bluetooth using the standard pairing steps, with support for both Bluetooth 3.0 and Bluetooth 5.0 included. One distinct advantage compared to Apple's Magic Keyboard is that the Echelon supports connections to up to three devices, so you can pair it to your Mac, your <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>, and even another device and easily switch between those devices with a key combo.<br/>
<br/>
Overall, I've found Alogic's Echelon USB-C Rechargeable Wireless Keyboard for macOS to be a solid budget keyboard, with a slim profile, a solid typing experience, and a nice set of key functions. The matte white plastic is a clean look that complements the Apple aesthetic, though I'll have to see how well it holds up to picking up dirt and stains over time. I do miss having &zwnj;Touch ID&zwnj; right on my external keyboard, but if that's not a deal-breaker for you, this keyboard might be worth a look. It's <a href="https://alogic.co/products/echelon-usb-c-rechargeable-wireless-keyboard-for-macos/?ref=y2uwzwu">normally priced at &#36;59.99</a>, but an Independence Day sale going on now knocks the price down to &#36;48.00 with promo code ID20.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Echelon USB-C Rechargeable Wireless Mouse </h2><br/>
<a href="https://alogic.co/products/echelon-usb-c-rechargeable-wireless-mouse-white/?ref=y2uwzwu">Alogic's new mouse</a> is a well-matched complement to the Echelon keyboard, coming in the same matte white plastic. It's an ambidextrous mouse, so it's a simple matter of switching between left and right hands in macOS settings, though it's not as ergonomic as a handed mouse.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/alogic-echelon-mouse.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-957183" /><br/>
The Echelon mouse includes the standard left and right mouse buttons and a scroll wheel in between them. The scroll wheel can also be pressed to act as a middle mouse button, but that's it as far as input options on this mouse. There are no additional side or thumb buttons, so if those are something that's become part of your workflow, this mouse isn't for you, at least as an everyday mouse.<br/>
<br/>
The left and right mouse buttons have relatively quiet clicks, which I tend to like, but the middle scroll wheel button is quite loud. Fortunately, that one isn't needed nearly as often so it's not a significant issue. The scroll wheel has well-defined clicks as you scroll to help you feel the movement, but there's no inertial free-spinning capability for quickly scrolling long pages or documents as I have come to appreciate on the Logitech MX Master 3 mouse that has been my daily driver for many years.<br/>
<br/>
At just &#36;24.99 for a wireless mouse, this is definitely a budget pick, and it does show in the overall experience, especially when you're used to a more powerful option. Alogic's Echelon mouse is extremely lightweight, and I find it glides best with some sort of desk pad or mat under it for a better feel, though it is certainly usable on a bare desk surface.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/alogic-echelon-mouse-bottom.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-957184" /><br/>
Alogic's Echelon mouse supports both Bluetooth 3.0 and Bluetooth 5.0, and it easily connects to a Mac or &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; using the system settings, but the mouse also supports 2.4GHz connections that can deliver improved performance such as lower latency. That 2.4GHz support comes via a small USB-A dongle that conveniently fits into the underside of the mouse when not in use so you don't lose it. Of course, most modern Macs don't include any USB-A ports, but I typically use my MacBook Pro in a desk setup with a Thunderbolt dock that does include some USB-A ports, and the mouse connects fine via the dongle that way. Regardless, most users will likely opt for a Bluetooth connection given the simplicity.<br/>
<br/>
As with the Echelon keyboard, the mouse goes to sleep after just a few minutes of inactivity, which can be a bit disconcerting when returning to my Mac after a short break. I use a total of three displays in my desk setup, so when I sit down at my desk I usually give my mouse a quick shake to locate my pointer. With this Echelon mouse, the pointer doesn't move if the mouse has gone to sleep, so I have to first click once to wake it up before I shake it, which runs the risk of an inadvertent click if it the mouse hadn't been idle long enough to go to sleep. It's possible I'd get used to this over time, but so far I still find it a bit annoying.<br/>
<br/>
As with most sensible wireless mice (sorry, Apple), the Echelon mouse charges via a USB-C port on the front, meaning it can still be used while it's charging. A white braided USB-C to USB-C cable is included in the box for charging purposes. Alogic says a charge should last two to three weeks with typical office usage, although I haven't been using it long enough to fully test those numbers. But given the small drop in charge I've seen in a few days of use, it seems reasonable, and perhaps even conservative, to me. Alogic indicates it takes about an hour to fully recharge the mouse.<br/>
<br/>
The Echelon mouse can be paired with up to three devices simultaneously, two via Bluetooth and one via the 2.4GHz USB dongle. A small connection button on the bottom of the mouse is used for pairing and cycling through the connected devices. There's also an on/off switch on the bottom to conserve battery life and prevent unintended inputs.<br/>
<br/>
Coming from a more powerful Logitech mouse, I can safely say that Alogic's Echelon mouse isn't going to become a full-time part of my setup. But at its budget price, it's potentially a solid option for tossing in a computer bag to use while on the go. While it doesn't include more advanced features, it does offer the basic mouse buttons and a scroll wheel and can pair to multiple devices, and that's all many users may be looking for. The <a href="https://alogic.co/products/echelon-usb-c-rechargeable-wireless-mouse-white/?ref=y2uwzwu">Echelon USB-C Rechargeable Wireless Mouse is normally priced at &#36;24.99</a>, but the Independence Day sale with promo code ID20 brings the price down to just &#36;20.00.<br/>
