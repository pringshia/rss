		<description><![CDATA[Amazon today has a pair of discounts on both models of the 15-inch M2 MacBook Air, thanks to a few on-page coupons found on their product pages. Many of the notebooks can be delivered as soon as January 13, although some models do have delayed shipping estimates ranging into late January.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/MacBook-Air-15-Inch-Feature-Blue.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="894" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-898578" /><em><small>Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with Amazon. When you click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment, which helps us keep the site running.</small></em><br/>
<br/>
The 256GB 15-inch M2 MacBook Air is available for <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0C75ZRQLB%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1"><strong>&#36;1,049.99</strong></a> in three colors, down from &#36;1,299.00. There's a hefty on-page coupon worth around &#36;152 that'll net you this second-best price, which is just about &#36;50 higher than the previous record low price we saw over the holidays.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><em><strong>Note: You won't see the deal price until checkout.</strong></em></div><br/>

For more storage, Amazon has the 512GB 15-inch M2 MacBook Air for <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0C76B7QHC%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1"><strong>&#36;1,249.99</strong></a> in two colors, down from &#36;1,499.00. You'll again need to clip the on-page coupon in order to see this discount, and this is another second-best price on the MacBook Air.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Amazon today announced Matter Casting, an interoperable rival to Apple's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airplay/">AirPlay</a> feature, at <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ces-2024/">CES 2024</a> (via <em><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-01-09/amazon-debuts-video-streaming-feature-that-rivals-apple-airplay">Bloomberg</a></em>).<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/09/echo-show.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-818290" /><br/>
Matter Casting will initially only support streaming content from Amazon's Prime Video app to Echo Show devices, but the feature will support Fire TV in the coming months. Later in the year, it will work across a range of other video services, including Plex, Starz, Pluto TV, Sling TV, and ZDF.<br/>
<br/>
&zwnj;AirPlay&zwnj; allows Apple device users to wirelessly stream video from an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>, or Mac to an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a> or another Mac, as well as stream audio from almost any Apple device to any <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod/">HomePod</a>, &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj;, or compatible third-party speaker. Google has a similar equivalent for its Chromecast devices called Google Cast. Both &zwnj;AirPlay&zwnj; and Google Cast are proprietary technologies, so Amazon's new feature is designed to be interoperable across platforms.<br/>
<br/>
Apple and Google worked with Amazon on the Matter home standard, but they have not yet announced any plans to support Matter Casting and could choose to remain uninvolved. Nevertheless, it is clearly Amazon's wish to make video streaming apps and TV accessories work together more seamlessly, regardless of their platform.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/amazon/">Amazon</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airplay/">AirPlay</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ces-2024/">CES 2024</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/09/amazon-unveils-matter-casting/">CES 2024: Amazon Unveils Matter Casting Standard as Interoperable Alternative to AirPlay</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ces-2024-amazon-unveils-matter-casting-standard-as-interoperable-alternative-to-airplay.2415868/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Popular smart lighting company Nanoleaf today announced the launch of several new Matter-enabled lighting options, including its first outdoor lights. The company is also debuting a new music feature and accepting pre-orders for the Nanoleaf Skylight.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/nanoleaf-permanent-outdoor-lights.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-929046" /><br/>
Nanoleaf's Matter-enabled lights include the Smart Multicolor Lightstrip, the Smart Multicolor Outdoor String Lights, and the Smart Multicolor Permanent Outdoor Lights. The Outdoor String Lights feature large bulbs for decorating a front entryway, patio, or deck, while the permanent lights are designed to be installed under the eaves of a house in lieu of holiday string lights.<br/>
<br/>
The Matter lights from Nanoleaf are <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/homekit/">HomeKit</a> compatible and can be controlled using the Nanoleaf app, the Home app, or <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a> voice commands. They support more than 16 million colors and several shades of white, and can be used with all of the Nanoleaf lighting scenes and app customization features.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/nanoleaf-outdoor-light-bulbs.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-929047" /><br/>
To go along with the lights, Nanoleaf announced new Orchestrator software for the Nanoleaf Desktop App, which will use real-time music analysis to create light shows that match with the beat. Orchestrator is able to connect directly with the sound source of a computer for a more accurate real-time audio visual experience.<br/>
<br/>
Compared to the Rhythm feature that reacts to sound, Orchestrator is designed to react to music. It can separate beats, melodies, and audio spectrum, timing the light activation to the songs that are playing.<br/>
<br/>
Both the new Matter-enabled lights and the Orchestrator will be available in the spring, but Nanoleaf is accepting pre-orders for the Skylight <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/01/03/nanoleaf-ces-2023/">first announced at CES 2023</a>. The Skylight is a square-shaped modular ceiling light panel setup that is hardwired and supports up to 100 squares.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/12/nanoleaf-skylight.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-878921" /><br/>
Nanoleaf's Skylight offers millions of color options like other Nanoleaf panels, and it can be controlled via the Nanoleaf app and the Home app. There are special scenes like Gentle Rain and Sun Shower, plus support for the Rhythm Music Visualizer. Each panel offers 1400 lumens of light.<br/>
<br/>
The Nanoleaf Skylight can be <a href="https://nanoleaf.me/en-US/">pre-ordered from the Nanoleaf website</a> for &#36;250 for three panels, with an additional panel expansion pack available for &#36;70.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/nanoleaf/">Nanoleaf</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ces-2024/">CES 2024</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/09/nanoleaf-ces-2024/">CES 2024: Nanoleaf Debuts Matter-Enabled Outdoor Lights and New Music Feature, Accepts Pre-Orders for Skylight</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ces-2024-nanoleaf-debuts-matter-enabled-outdoor-lights-and-new-music-feature-accepts-pre-orders-for-skylight.2415865/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

<br/>
The app is available on the iPhone, iPad, and Android devices. It is built upon Primephonic, a classical music streaming service acquired by Apple in 2021.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Images of an Alpine Loop prototype designed for a black Apple Watch Ultra model today surfaced online, supporting rumors that Apple had plans to release a darker version of the device last year.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/black-apple-watch-ultra-band.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-929756" /><br/>
Prior to the release of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch-ultra/">Apple Watch Ultra 2</a>, multiple rumors <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/01/apple-watch-ultra-2-black-titanium-rumor/">suggested</a> that Apple had plans to release a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/07/31/2023-apple-watch-ultra-new-dark-color/">new darker color option</a> that was originally tested for the previous model but ultimately canceled. When the device was announced in September 2023, it continued to only be available in the same natural titanium color as the first-generation model. <br/>
<br/>
Now, further indication has emerged that Apple had plans to release a darker color option. The latest images, <a href="https://x.com/DongleBookPro/status/1744716821553676298?s=20">shared by "DongleBookPro" on X</a>, show a blue Alpine Loop prototype with an anodized black titanium hook and lugs. The released version of the Alpine Loop has natural titanium trim to match the Apple Watch Ultra's casing.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Space Black Apple Watch Ultra Confirmed? <a href="https://t.co/aLjkJGCsg7">pic.twitter.com/aLjkJGCsg7</a></p>&mdash; Dongle (@DongleBookPro) <a href="https://twitter.com/DongleBookPro/status/1744716821553676298?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 9, 2024</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div><br/>
Apple released the blue version of the Alpine Loop alongside the &zwnj;Apple Watch Ultra 2&zwnj;, supporting previous indications that the company had concrete plans to release the &zwnj;Apple Watch Ultra 2&zwnj; with a black color option. In November, documents filed with the United States Federal Communications Commission <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/17/new-apple-watch-ultra-black-prototype-images/">revealed a black Apple Watch Ultra</a> with a matching dark ceramic back, cementing the validity of earlier rumors.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/apple-watch-ultra-prototype-fcc.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-922908" /><br/>
The reason for Apple's decision to cancel the new colorway is unknown, but there is a chance that the company deemed the finish insufficiently durable for a device focused on withstanding extreme challenges. There have not yet been any rumors to suggest that Apple plans to revive the black colorway for the third-generation version of the device, but it could still be a possibility given how far developed the darker finish was for the current model prior to its release.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch-ultra/">Apple Watch Ultra 2</a></div><div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/donglebookpro/">DongleBookPro</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/prototypes/">Prototypes</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch_Ultra">Apple Watch Ultra (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-watch.172">Apple Watch</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/09/band-designed-for-black-apple-watch-ultra-surfaces/">Band Designed for Black Apple Watch Ultra Surfaces Online</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/band-designed-for-black-apple-watch-ultra-surfaces-online.2415859/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[At <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ces-2024/">CES 2024</a> this week, accessory company <a href="https://alogic.co/?ref=y2uwzwu">Alogic</a> is launching several new products in the display and charging categories, with both lineups offering some innovative features.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/alogic-clarity-32-display-matrix-ultimate.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-929726" /><br/>
First, Alogic's new Matrix lineup will offer an array of wireless chargers and power banks such as the Matrix Ultimate that I've had a chance to try out.<br/>
<br/>
The <a href="https://alogic.co/products/matrix-ultimate-3-in-1-wireless-charger-with-5-000mah-magsafe-power-bank/?ref=y2uwzwu">Matrix Ultimate</a> is a 3-in-1 folding stand with an integrated power bank. In stand mode, it's a fairly typical 3-in-1 charger, with an official <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe-battery-pack/">MagSafe</a> charging pad for your phone plus an elevated Apple Watch charger on behind the device and a spot on the rear portion of the base for AirPods or another Qi device.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/alogic-matrix-ultimate-front.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-929712" /><br/>
The AirPods charging spot is unfortunately not magnetic, so you'll need to manually ensure your AirPods are properly aligned for charging, but it seems pretty forgiving on the placement and with supported AirPods you can also use the magnetic Apple Watch charger on the stand.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/alogic-matrix-ultimate-rear.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-929713" /><br/>
Beyond being a typical 3-in-1 charger, the Matrix Ultimate has a few tricks up its sleeve. First, the &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; charging pad is actually part of a 5,000 mAh power bank that slides into the stand where it supports the phone and receives fixed power from the base unit. Even in power bank mode, it still supports 15-watt &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; charging.<br/>
<br/>
The power bank is fairly compact, but it's a little thicker than some other 5,000 mAh options on the market and only the &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; pad portion of it sits flush against the back of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>, so it will pop loose from the phone if you press the lower portion of the power bank toward the phone. As a result, this isn't the type of magnetic power bank I would want to leave attached to my phone throughout the day, but for periodic charging while in a fixed location it would be perfectly fine.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/alogic-matrix-ultimate-power-bank.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-929715" /><br/>
In addition to the removable power bank, the Matrix Ultimate also features a removable Apple Watch charging puck that connects to the body of the stand via USB-C. The puck supports Apple Watch fast charging, and the removable design gives you the flexibility to take just the Apple Watch charger with you depending on what you need. You can then just plug it directly into a power adapter, a computer USB port, or even the USB-C port on the Matrix Ultimate power bank in order to recharge your watch.<br/>
<br/>

The third trick up the Matrix Ultimate's sleeve is that the whole things folds down for travel and can be stored in a felt travel case alongside the provided USB-C to USB-C cable and 30-watt power adapter with folding prongs in the U.S. The whole thing remains a bit on the bulky side due in part to the hardware needed for the removable power bank, but it should still pack easily in most computer bags, backpacks, or suitcases.<br/>
<br/>

The Matrix Ultimate is largely constructed of a matte white plastic with a shiny chrome-colored hinge between the stand and base, though this is essentially hidden unless the stand is viewed from the rear. It's <a href="https://alogic.co/products/matrix-ultimate-3-in-1-wireless-charger-with-5-000mah-magsafe-power-bank/?ref=y2uwzwu">priced at &#36;169.99</a> in the U.S. and roughly equivalent amounts in the UK, EU, and Australia. A multi-country model including a 35-watt adapter with plugs for the US, UK, EU, and Australia will be &#36;10 more. Alogic currently has a sale going that knocks 20% off of those prices with coupon code CS20, bringing the U.S. model down to &#36;136.00.<br/>
<br/>
Second, the company is expanding its line of Clarity displays to include a trio of 32-inch models. Just like with the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/review/alogic-clarity-pro-touch-displays/">27-inch Clarity displays</a> released last year, the 32-inch options include a <a href="https://alogic.co/products/clarity-max-32-uhd-4k-monitor-with-usb-c-power-delivery/?ref=y2uwzwu">base model</a>, a <a href="https://alogic.co/products/clarity-max-pro-32-uhd-4k-monitor-with-usb-c-power-delivery-and-webcam/?ref=y2uwzwu">middle-tier model</a> with a motorized retractable 8-megapixel webcam, and a <a href="https://alogic.co/products/clarity-max-touch-32-uhd-4k-monitor-with-usb-c-power-delivery-webcam-and-touch-screen/?ref=y2uwzwu">high-end model</a> with both webcam and touchscreen support.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/alogic-32-clarity-display.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="970" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-929717" /><br/>
All three displays offer 4K resolution at 60 Hz, which still looks decent at reasonably scaled desktop sizes, but you won't get the true Retina quality you see on higher-density displays like 27-inch 5K displays and you won't get the benefit of higher refresh rates.<br/>
<br/>
The 32-inch models all provide up to 65-watts of passthrough power via USB-C to keep your laptop charged, which should be sufficient for most users, although the most powerful MacBook Pro models could draw more than that under heavy load.<br/>
<br/>
All three models also have a small USB hub on the rear of the display with a pair of USB-A ports (5 Gbps and 7.5 watts) plus a 3.5mm combo audio jack. If you want or need to use something other than USB-C, the display also include a pair of HDMI 2.1 ports and a DisplayPort 1.4 port<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/alogic-32-clarity-display-ports.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-929720" /><br/>
The included stand on all Clarity Max models supports tilt and height adjustments, as well as the ability to pivot the display to portrait mode. The display can also be used with 100x100 VESA mounts.<br/>
<br/>
I've had a brief opportunity to try out the high-end Clarity Max Touch model, and my impressions are very similar to those from the corresponding 27-inch model, just with a bigger display. The touchscreen functionality is highly customizable on a per-app basis with the system able to recognize several different gestures, which is fantastic.<br/>
<br/>
I still don't see myself using the touchscreen capabilities (which can be used with fingers or a capacitive stylus, but not an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-pencil/">Apple Pencil</a>) on a full-time basis, but especially in a multi-monitor setup it can be handy to be able to quickly tap on the screen rather than having to move a mouse cursor across multiple displays.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/alogic-32-clarity-display-camera.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-929721" /><br/>
The retractable webcam offers some nice peace of mind, as once it's tucked away you can be sure that it's not being used to surreptitiously monitor you. And at 8 megapixels, it offers solid quality better than many other built-in webcams found on displays, although it doesn't match what you get when using an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; via Continuity Camera.<br/>
<br/>
The stand is a high-quality two-piece aluminum design that provides very good stability and smooth adjustments, plus a passthrough to help with cable management. The display itself is constructed of a silver plastic shell on the back with nearly edge-to-edge glass on front. There are definite black bezels on all four sides under the glass, with the bottom being somewhat wider than the other three.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/alogic-32-clarity-display-rear.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="920" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-929722" /><br/>
The base <a href="https://alogic.co/products/clarity-max-32-uhd-4k-monitor-with-usb-c-power-delivery/?ref=y2uwzwu">Clarity Max</a> model is priced at &#36;999.99, while the <a href="https://alogic.co/products/clarity-max-pro-32-uhd-4k-monitor-with-usb-c-power-delivery-and-webcam/?ref=y2uwzwu">Clarity Max Pro with retractable webcam</a> is priced at &#36;1,199.99, and the top-of-the-line <a href="https://alogic.co/products/clarity-max-touch-32-uhd-4k-monitor-with-usb-c-power-delivery-webcam-and-touch-screen/?ref=y2uwzwu">Clarity Max Touch with webcam and touchscreen capabilities</a> is priced at &#36;1,399.99, but Alogic's sale currently knocks 20% off of those prices with coupon code CS20.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple is asking developers to avoid mention of "AR" and "VR," as well as the Vision Pro as a generic "headset," when listing their apps on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/visionos/">visionOS</a> <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/visionos-app-preview.jpg" alt="" width="1470" height="827" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-929750" /><br/>
<a href="https://developer.apple.com/visionos/submit/">Apple's developer website</a> now features new requirements for Vision Pro apps (via <em><a href="https://9to5mac.com/2024/01/08/apple-visionos-apps-ar-vr/">9to5Mac</a></em>), including how to appropriately list their apps on the &zwnj;visionOS&zwnj; &zwnj;App Store&zwnj;. Instructions about how developers should describe their apps include specific prohibition of the terms augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), extended reality (XR), or mixed reality (MR).<br/>
<br/>
Instead, developers should adopt the "spatial computing" phrasing that Apple has touted since the Vision Pro's announcement in June last year. The push is likely part of Apple's continued effort to disassociate the Vision Pro headset from other products in the space from the likes of Meta and forge its own path in the minds of customers.<blockquote><strong>Spatial computing</strong>: Refer to your app as a spatial computing app. Don't describe your app experience as augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), extended reality (XR), or mixed reality (MR).</blockquote>Similarly, Apple requests that app developers do not refer to the Vision Pro generically as a "headset."<blockquote><strong>Apple Vision Pro</strong>: Always typeset Apple Vision Pro as three words with an uppercase A, V, and P followed by lowercase letters. Don't break Apple Vision Pro over two lines. Don't use the article the before Apple Vision Pro. Apple Vision Pro apps are available on the App Store or can be downloaded from the App Store. It's acceptable to say Name of app for Apple Vision Pro when your promotion is focused on features and benefits related to Apple Vision Pro. Don't refer to Apple Vision Pro generically as a "headset." The phrase "Apple Vision Pro" can't be included in your app name, but it can be included in your app description.</blockquote>Apple is also continuing to change mentions of "<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a>" to "Apple Vision" throughout its beta cycle. For example, Apple now refers to "Mac, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>, Apple Vision apps" instead of "Mac, &zwnj;iPad&zwnj;, &zwnj;Apple Vision Pro&zwnj; apps." Apple's website features a "Vision" product tab instead of a "Vision Pro" tab, but the gradual shift toward "Apple Vision" branding appears to add credence to the idea of Apple building a "Vision" product line.<br/>
<br/>
The Vision Pro is positioned as a high-end device with a &#36;3,499 price tag, but there have been a multitude of rumors about Apple's plans to release a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/28/work-on-multiple-next-gen-vision-pro-headsets/">cheaper headset</a> in the future. Such a device would make sense as an "Apple Vision" headset, just as the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; is to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a> or the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod/">HomePod</a> is to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod-mini/">HomePod mini</a>.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-vision-pro.209">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/09/vision-pro-developers-asked-to-avoid-vr-branding/">Apple Asks Vision Pro Developers to Avoid &#039;VR&#039; Branding and Hints at &#039;Vision&#039; Product Line</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-asks-vision-pro-developers-to-avoid-vr-branding-and-hints-at-vision-product-line.2415856/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<title>Kuo: Apple Vision Pro to Sell Out Fast, Leading to Long Shipping Delays</title>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple on Monday <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/08/apple-announces-february-2-vision-pro-launch/">announced</a> it would begin accepting pre-orders for its new Vision Pro headset on January 19, with an official launch in the U.S. to follow on February 2. But if you're in the market for one, you may have to move fast, according to Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/Apple-Vision-Pro-Dual-Loop-Band-Teal-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="1960" height="1102" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-929682" /><br/>
"Thanks to the demand from Apple's core fans and heavy users, the Vision Pro should sell out soon after it is available for pre-order or sale, resulting in a longer shipping time," said Kuo in his <a href="https://medium.com/@mingchikuo/對於vision-pro預購與發售-投資人該關注什麼-what-investors-should-look-for-in-the-vision-pro-pre-order-and-launch-6cb2fae053c8">latest report</a> covering Apple's announcement, which the analyst <a href="https://medium.com/@mingchikuo/2024年消費電子產業三大關鍵投資趨勢-android庫存回補-vision-pro與ai-pc-手機-three-key-consumer-electronics-investment-42e680eb253b">accurately predicted</a> ahead of time. <br/>
<br/>
"However, whether the demand for Vision Pro can be sustained after the novelty wears off is even more important, depending on whether Vision Pro's product positioning and key applications are clear and correct," added the analyst.<br/>
<br/>
Kuo noted that Apple may need to reveal more details about the headset in the run-up to pre-order or launch to help maintain sales momentum and attract developers. Currently, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/08/vision-pro-lens-inserts-to-start-at-99/">ZEISS lens inserts</a> starting at &#36;99 are the sole other optional purchase for the Vision Pro headset that Apple has announced.<br/>
<br/>
Beyond that, Apple has said only that the Vision Pro will be available "starting at &#36;3,499 with 256GB of storage," suggesting customers will be offered a series of configuration options at increasing price points. <br/>
<br/>
Included with the Vision Pro headset is a Solo Knit Band, a Dual Loop Band, a Light Seal, two Light Seal Cushions, a cover for the front of the device, a polishing cloth, battery unit, USB-C charging cable, and USB-C power adapter. Despite these details, other questions remain. <br/>
<br/>
For example, Apple previously said the Vision Pro could be used indefinitely if the battery was itself plugged into an external power source, but that text has since been removed from the Vision Pro product page. Apple will likely offer additional battery units for purchase, but even this has not yet been officially confirmed by the company.<br/>
<br/>
Apple is expected to make fewer than 400,000 units in 2024, with previous reports suggesting that Apple has been forced to make "drastic cuts" to its <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/07/03/apple-vision-pro-drastic-production-cuts/">production forecasts</a> because of difficulties with manufacturing. <br/>
<br/>
Apple plans to start offering Vision Pro <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/08/apple-vision-pro-demos-february-2/">demonstrations</a> at Apple retail stores in the U.S. on the official launch date of the device, Friday, February 2.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/">Ming-Chi Kuo</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-vision-pro.209">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/09/kuo-apple-vision-pro-may-sell-out-fast/">Kuo: Apple Vision Pro to Sell Out Fast, Leading to Long Shipping Delays</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/kuo-apple-vision-pro-to-sell-out-fast-leading-to-long-shipping-delays.2415852/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's AirDrop feature has reportedly been cracked by a Chinese state-backed institution, allowing authorities to identify senders who share "undesirable content" over the peer-to-peer wireless protocol (via <em><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-01-09/china-says-cracked-apple-s-airdrop-to-identify-message-sources">Bloomberg</a></em>).<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/airdrop-videos-ios-17.jpg" alt="" width="2484" height="1391" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-900711" /><br/>
AirDrop is Apple's ad-hoc service that lets users discover nearby Macs and iOS devices and securely transfer files between them over Wi-Fi and Bluetooth. Users can send and receive photos, videos, documents, contacts, passwords and anything else that can be transferred from a Share Sheet.<br/>
<br/>
Apple advertises the protocol as secure because the wireless connection uses Transport Layer Security (TLS) encryption, but the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Justice (BMBJ) says it has devised a way to bypass the protocol's encryption and reveal identifying information.<br/>
<br/>
According to the <a href="https://sfj.beijing.gov.cn/sfj/sfdt/ywdt82/flfw93/436331732/index.html">BMBJ's website</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> device logs were analyzed to create a "rainbow table" which allowed investigators to convert hidden hash values into the original text and correlate the phone numbers and email accounts of AirDrop content senders.<br/>
<br/>
The "technological breakthrough" has successfully helped the public security authorities identify a number of criminal suspects, who use the AirDrop function to spread illegal content, the BMBJ added. <br/>
<br/>
"It improves the efficiency and accuracy of case-solving and prevents the spread of inappropriate remarks as well as potential bad influences," the bureau added.<br/>
<br/>
It is not known if the security flaw in the AirDrop protocol has been exploited by a government agency before now, but it is not the first time a flaw has been discovered. In April 2021, German researchers <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/23/airdrop-researchers-security-flaw/">found</a> that the mutual authentication mechanism that confirms both the receiver and sender are on each other's address book could be used to expose private information. According to the researchers, Apple was informed of the flaw in May of 2019, but did not fix it.<br/>
<br/>
Apple limited the use of the AirDrop on devices in China in November 2022, after anti-government activists used the function to spread political leaflets. AirDrop became restricted by default to Contacts Only, and the option to turn on AirDrop for "Everyone" was limited to 10 minutes. <br/>
<br/>
With the launch of iOS 16.2, Apple expanded the AirDrop limitation it introduced in China to all users globally, but Apple said that the feature was actually introduced in an effort to cut down on spam content spread in crowded areas like malls and airports.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/china/">China</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airdrop/">AirDrop</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/09/airdrop-cracked-chinese-authorities/">AirDrop &#039;Cracked&#039; By Chinese Authorities to Identify Senders</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/airdrop-cracked-by-chinese-authorities-to-identify-senders.2415850/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple was granted 2,536 patents in the United States last year, surpassed by only six other companies, IFI Claims reports.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/12/Apple-Logo-16x9-US-Flag-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-926535" /><br/>
In its <a href="https://www.ificlaims.com/rankings-top-50-2023.htm">rankings of the top 50 U.S. patent assignees in 2023</a>, IFI Claims Patent Services shows that Apple was granted 251 more patents by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office in 2023 compared to the previous year, an 11% increase. This moved the company one place up the annual patent rankings.<br/>
<br/>
Apple's number of granted patents was surpassed by Samsung Electronics, Qualcomm, TSMC, IBM, Canon, and Samsung Display. Samsung Electronics again dwarfed the other top companies, with 6,165 patents granted. Apple outranked companies including LG, Micron, Intel, Huawei, Toyota, Google, Microsoft, BOE, and Amazon. Out of IFI's "Magnificent Seven" technology companies, encompassing Google, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Tesla, Apple was the clear leader for new patents in 2023.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="https://www.ificlaims.com/rankings-global-assets-2023.htm">IFI Claims' 2023 Global 250 rankings</a> reveal the world's largest patent holders by looking at all of the patents currently held by companies. In these rankings, Apple takes 51st place with 21,407 active patents. Panasonic is currently the world leader for active patents, with 94,341 in total, edging out Samsung who has 92,593 patents. <br/>

While the Vision Pro will work with any TV show or movie available through the &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj; app on the device, specific titles have been updated with 3D that will make for an even more immersive experience. TV shows and movies that are not 3D will appear on a screen that "feels 100 feet wide," with the Vision Pro offering the resolution of a 4K TV for each eye, along with HDR support.<br/>
<br/>
Apple has created Apple Immersive Video, a "new entertainment format" that is designed to put users inside action with 180-degree 3D 8K video recordings that have been captured with Spatial Audio, plus there will be interactive experiences like "Encounter Dinosaurs."<br/>
<br/>
As for gaming, the Vision Pro will support more than 250 titles on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-arcade/">Apple Arcade</a>, with the content able to be played in 2D using a game controller. There are also select "spatial games" that have been created for the device, including Game Room, What the Golf?, and Super Fruit Ninja. Apple says that these games take advantage of the Vision Pro's capabilities to transform the space around players, providing "unique and engaging gameplay experiences."<br/>
<br/>
The Vision Pro is set to launch on Friday, February 2, with Apple to begin accepting pre-orders on Friday, January 19.

		<description><![CDATA[NuraLogix this week unveiled the <a href="https://www.nuralogix.ai/magic-mirror/">Anura MagicMirror</a>, a new health product that is designed to use a combination of sensors and artificial intelligence to check vital signs and provide disease risk assessments.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe title="AnuraTM MagicMirrorTM Demo - English" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8QWC9J9sfyA" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" data-thumb-size="hqdefault"></iframe></div><br/>
The 21.5-inch tabletop smart mirror takes a 30 second scan when a person sits in front of it, analyzing facial blood flow to provide a wealth of information. It uses a patented Transdermal Optical Imaging technology to detect a person's face and monitor blood flow. Machine learning algorithms use the data to provide information on more than 100 health parameters.<br/>
<br/>
NuraLogix says that the MagicMirror can provide health information that includes blood pressure, BMI, heart rate variability, pulse rate, breathing rate, and facial skin age. It can provide risk assessments for diabetes, cardiovascular disease, stroke, hypertension, fatty liver disease, and more, plus it offers assessments of mental stress and depression risk.<br/>
<br/>

More information on the MagicMirror can be <a href="https://www.nuralogix.ai/magic-mirror/">found on the NuraLogix website</a>. The company has not provided a launch date or a price, but the device appears to be aimed at clinic waiting rooms, retirement homes, and other health-related facilities.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ces-2024/">CES 2024</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/08/ces-2024-anura-magicmirror/">CES 2024: This &#039;MagicMirror&#039; Analyzes Facial Blood Flow to Monitor Vital Signs</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ces-2024-this-magicmirror-analyzes-facial-blood-flow-to-monitor-vital-signs.2415810/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[<a href="https://petcare.invoxia.com/">Invoxia</a> at CES unveiled the Minitailz Smart Pet Tracker, an AI wearable that's designed for dogs and cats. The Minitailz is an all-in-one GPS tracker and wellness device for pets, and it is able to measure respiratory rate and heart vitals, alerting owners about possible health issues.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/invoxia-minitailz.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-929690" /><br/>
Invoxia says that the Minitailz is able to watch for anomalies in pet behavior that can be indicative of a problem, and it can differentiate between walking, running, scratching, eating and drinking, barking, and rest.<br/>
<br/>
In addition to collecting heart health information that is said to be 97 to 99 percent accurate, the Minitailz can detect atrial fibrillation in pets. Detailed health reports are provided in the accompanying app.<br/>
<br/>
A built-in SIM with GPS technology allows for tracking of daily activities or locating a pet should it be lost. There are also geofencing features so that a pet owner can be alerted if a pet wanders outside the boundaries of a property.<br/>
<br/>
The Minitailz measures in at 2.32 inches long, 1.18 inches tall, and 0.9 inches thick, and it can be attached to an existing dog or cat collar.<br/>
<br/>
A dog version of the Minitailz is available as of now <a href="https://petcare.invoxia.com/">from the Invoxia website</a>, with the cat model set to launch in March 2024. Both versions are priced at &#36;99, with a subscription fee that starts at &#36;8.30 per month.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ces-2024/">CES 2024</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/08/ces-2024-invoxia-minitailz/">CES 2024: Invoxia Launches AI Wearable That Monitors Your Pet&#039;s Health</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ces-2024-invoxia-launches-ai-wearable-that-monitors-your-pets-health.2415808/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[An <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> that was expelled from the cabin of Alaska Airlines flight 1282 on Friday survived a fall of more than 16,000 feet and was discovered intact.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/recovered-alaska-phone.jpg" alt="" width="1153" height="648" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-929685" /><br/>
Vancouver, Washington resident Sean Bates shared images of the device on Sunday after he found it on the side of Barnes Road in Portland, Oregon. The &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; was in full working condition and was in fact still open to an Alaska Airlines email. There were no cracks on the display, though it was protected by a case and presumably landed in a forested area with soft ground cover.<br/>
<br/>
Bates alerted the National Transportation Safety Board, and officials came out to collect the device. The NTSB told Bates that it was the second phone to be found from the flight in the area.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Found an iPhone on the side of the road...

The &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; was <a href="https://news.alaskaair.com/alaska-airlines/operations/as-1282/?linkId=100000234605102">expelled from Alaska Airlines flight 1282</a> after a portion of the plane blew out shortly after it took off from the Portland International Airport. The aircraft was able to safely land back at the Portland airport, and all passengers and crew members survived.<br/>
<br/>
The sudden depressurization in the cabin of the plane caused items like smartphones to be sucked out, where they fell to the ground below. In 2011, <em>Wired</em> <a href="https://www.wired.com/2011/04/what-is-the-terminal-velocity-of-an-iphone/">wrote a piece</a> on the terminal velocity of an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; falling from a plane, which is a good explainer how the device was able to survive. In a nutshell, the low weight and maximum speed of the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; leads to a limited amount of force on landing despite the height of the fall, so the end result isn't too much different from dropping it from a lower height.<br/>
<br/>
There were two smartphones found from the plane, along with other debris such as the plug door that may give some insight into what went wrong.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/08/iphone-survives-fall-from-plane/">iPhone Survives 16,000-Foot Drop After Alaska Airlines Plane Incident</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-survives-16-000-foot-drop-after-alaska-airlines-plane-incident.2415799/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today released Xcode 15.2 and <a href="https://developer.apple.com/news/releases/?id=01082024a">TestFlight version 3.5</a>, both of which have been updated with support for the Vision Pro headset that is set to come out in early February.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/12/testflight-icon.jpg" alt="" width="1117" height="629" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-927373" /><br/>
Xcode 15.2 is equipped with the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/visionos/">visionOS</a> SDK, and <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode-release-notes/xcode-15_2-release-notes">the release notes</a> suggest that Apple has implemented several fixes for &zwnj;visionOS&zwnj; into the software. Xcode 15.2 can be used by developers to create &zwnj;visionOS&zwnj; apps for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a> headset, and it also includes SDKs for iOS 17.2, iPadOS 17.2, tvOS 17.2, watchOS 10.2, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sonoma/">macOS Sonoma</a> 14.2.<br/>
<br/>
As for TestFlight, version 3.5 of the app allows for the beta testing of &zwnj;visionOS&zwnj; apps for the first time, plus it allows compatible iOS and iPadOS apps to be used on the &zwnj;Apple Vision Pro&zwnj; headset.<br/>
<br/>
Apps created for &zwnj;visionOS&zwnj; can be submitted to the &zwnj;Apple Vision Pro&zwnj; <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a> starting today. Many <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> apps will work on &zwnj;Apple Vision Pro&zwnj; unmodified, but developers can make device-specific tweaks. Apple plans to publish &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; apps on the Vision Pro store by default, but developers can opt out through &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; Connect.<br/>
<br/>
The Vision Pro headset will launch on Friday, February 2 at retail stores in the United States. Pre-orders for the device will be accepted starting on Friday, January 19 at 5:00 a.m. Pacific Time.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/testflight/">TestFlight</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/xcode/">Xcode</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/08/apple-releases-vision-pro-updates-testflight-xcode/">Apple Releases New Versions of TestFlight and Xcode With Vision Pro Support, Starts Accepting visionOS Apps</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-releases-new-versions-of-testflight-and-xcode-with-vision-pro-support-starts-accepting-visionos-apps.2415797/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

Once you receive that email, you will have until May 15, 2024, to claim your payment.</blockquote>Back in 2021, Apple agreed to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/04/apple-refurbished-lawsuit-settlement/">pay &#36;95 million</a> to settle an AppleCare-related lawsuit that accused the company of violating U.S. law by providing customers with refurbished replacement devices instead of new devices when <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/applecare/">AppleCare</a> repairs were required.<br/>
<br/>
The settlement was approved in April 2022, and Apple sent out some payments <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/08/25/apple-class-action-refurbished-lawsuit-payments/">starting in August 2022</a>, but a new wave of emails went out to customers today. The lawsuit covered iPhones and iPads purchased between July 20, 2012 and September, 30, 2021 and replaced with a refurbished device.<br/>
<br/>
A second wave of payments that are being sent out to disburse remaining funds after the first payments were received. Only 31 percent of those eligible claimed the first payment, leaving money for a second payment. <br/>
<br/>
While Apple paid &#36;95 million to settle the lawsuit, the company admitted no wrongdoing and has denied that refurbished devices are inferior to new devices.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/lawsuit/">Apple Lawsuits</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/applecare/">AppleCare</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/08/apple-refurbished-lawsuit-payments-january-2024/">Second Payment Emails for Refurbished Apple Device Class Action Lawsuit Going Out Tomorrow</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/second-payment-emails-for-refurbished-apple-device-class-action-lawsuit-going-out-tomorrow.2415789/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple plans to start offering Vision Pro demonstrations at U.S. Apple retail stores on Friday, February 2, Apple said today in emails that are going out to select customers. February 2 is the official launch date of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a> headset.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/Apple-Vision-Pro-Dual-Loop-Band.jpg" alt="" width="1960" height="1102" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-929475" /><br/>
The demo sessions will be available at Apple retail stores in the United States. Apple says that demo times will be offered through the weekend on a first-come, first-served basis, with signups to take place starting at 8:00 a.m. on February 2.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">New information regarding Apple Vision Pro demos at Apple Stores<br><br>“Be one of the first to get a demo of Apple Vision Pro. Only at the Apple Store. Starting at 8:00 a.m. on Friday, February 2, we invite you to sign up for a demo of Apple Vision Pro at your local Apple Store. Demo… <a href="https://t.co/tPzgBWwcUK">pic.twitter.com/tPzgBWwcUK</a></p>&mdash; M1 (@M1Astra) <a href="https://twitter.com/M1Astra/status/1744429033171951846?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 8, 2024</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div><br/>
<br/>
It is likely that the available demo spots will fill up quickly, especially in areas with a limited number of Apple Stores, so those interested in testing the headset should plan to sign up early.<br/>
<br/>
Apple plans to begin accepting pre-orders for the Vision Pro on Friday, January 19, with deliveries on February 2. The headset will be available in all U.S. Apple locations on February 2.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-vision-pro.209">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/08/apple-vision-pro-demos-february-2/">Apple Offering Vision Pro Demos Starting on February 2</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-offering-vision-pro-demos-starting-on-february-2.2415787/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The annual CES event kicks off this week, and we sent <em>MacRumors</em> videographer Dan Barbera to hunt down cool new products and technologies that are being previewed this year. CES officially starts tomorrow, but Dan attended CES Unveiled last night, and was able to get an early look at devices from Samsung,<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe title="CES 2024: Insane New Tech from Samsung &amp; CES Unveiled!" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/x8TuG7Or5y8" width="1673" height="807" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div><br/>
Samsung showed off new OLED TVs with an updated anti-reflective coating that makes them much better in bright rooms and with reflective lights, plus there was a new 8K projector and some very impressive transparent OLED screens.<br/>
<br/>
Samsung had a neat 2D/3D display that uses cameras and eye tracking to display content in 3D without the need for glasses, and Dan was also impressed with a customizable music frame that holds artwork but also serves as a speaker for a subtle surround sound system.<br/>
<br/>
At Unveiled, Dan checked out a pet-focused robot vacuum and mop combo from Narwhal, Belkin's Qi2 wireless chargers and StandDock Pro, a Keurig sort of device for ice cream, and some retro Mac power adapters from Sharge.<br/>
<br/>
Make sure to watch the full video to see the products in action, and stay tuned to <em>MacRumors</em> because we'll be sharing CES videos and articles for the next few days.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ces-2024/">CES 2024</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/08/ces-2024-day-1-recap/">CES 2024 Day 1: What&#039;s New From Samsung and CES Unveiled</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ces-2024-day-1-whats-new-from-samsung-and-ces-unveiled.2415785/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>
