		<description><![CDATA[Today is the launch day of the Apple Watch Series 9 and Apple Watch Ultra 2, and we're already tracking the first discounts on both wearables. Available at Amazon, you can get &#36;9 off the Apple Watch Series 9 and &#36;19 off the Apple Watch Ultra 2, with no coupon code required.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Although not particularly steep discounts, given that it's launch day these are pretty solid deals for anyone who planned on picking up one of the new Apple Watch models today. If you want a bigger markdown, and are okay with buying a previous generation device, Amazon has the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/21/deals-apple-watch-ultra-698/">original Apple Watch Ultra at &#36;99 off</a> in select colors right now.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fstores%2Fpage%2F47259FD7-DAA2-4BD0-8CDF-BB87B8981EB6%3Fingress%3D2%26visitId%3D57642ce4-d45d-4563-8ecf-e3fa49fa6837%26ref_%3Dast_bln"target="_blank"><div class="fancybutton"><div class="fancybadge">UP TO &#36;19 OFF</div>Apple Watch Series 9 and Ultra 2 Launch Day Deals</div></a></div><br/>
<br/>
A few of the Apple Watch Ultra 2 models are temporarily out of stock right now, but Amazon notes that you can place your order at the discounted price and they will email you when they have an estimated delivery date. Otherwise, most models of both the Ultra 2 and Series 9 will deliver between September 24 and September 27.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch/">Apple Watch Series 9</a> is available in a range of color options and finishes, with an entirely new hue available alongside some popular classics.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/Apple-Watch-Series-9.jpg" alt="" width="2880" height="1620" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-910331" /><br/>
The &zwnj;Apple Watch Series 9&zwnj; is available in a total of eight colors, one of which is a brand new shade, and two distinct finishes. With an aluminum casing, the &zwnj;Apple Watch Series 9&zwnj;'s four available color options are:<br/>
<br/>
<ul><br/>
<li>Pink</li><br/>
<li>Starlight</li><br/>
<li>Silver</li><br/>
<li>Midnight</li><br/>
</ul><br/>
<br/>
Starlight, Silver, and Midnight were all available on last year's Series 8 models. The only difference with this year's aluminum models is the discontinuation of the (PRODUCT)RED model and its replacement with a new soft pink color. This mirrors the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a> and &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; Plus, where the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-14/">iPhone 14</a>'s (PRODUCT)RED finish was discontinued and replaced with a new pink shade.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/apple-watch-series-9-aluminum-color-options.jpg" alt="" width="3840" height="2160" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-913143" /><br/>
<br/>
Apple's Silver anodized aluminum finish has been available on the company's devices for well over a decade, while Starlight is a warmer shade of silver that subtly angles toward gold or champagne. Midnight is effectively black with a hint of dark blue or navy. Each of the color options has a matching Apple Watch band, except for silver, since it is easily matched with so many other Apple Watch bands.<br/>
<br/>
The &zwnj;Apple Watch Series 9&zwnj; is also available with a polished stainless steel casing in four different color options:<br/>
<br/>
<ul><br/>
<li>Silver</li><br/>
<li>Gold</li><br/>
<li>Graphite</li><br/>
<li>Space Black (Apple Watch Hermès only) </li><br/>
</ul><br/>
<br/>
This selection of stainless steel finishes is identical to the previous generation's offerings. While stainless steel is heavier than aluminum, it is much harder and more durable. It may be more liable to scratch due to its polished finish, but they can be buffed out like a conventional watch or an item of jewelry.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2014/09/apple-watch-series-7-stainless-steel-colors.jpg" alt="" width="1960" height="1102" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-816234" /><br/>
The stainless steel Apple Watch offers a more high-end, fashion-forward aesthetic, especially when paired with a premium band like the Modern Buckle. The Apple Watch Hermès takes the stainless steel Apple Watch to the next level with exclusive watch faces and ultra-premium bands.<br/>
<br/>
The aluminum &zwnj;Apple Watch Series 9&zwnj; starts at &#36;399, while the stainless steel model costs &#36;699. The only difference between the casings other than their material and weight is the front crystal, which is upgraded from Ion-X strengthened glass to sapphire crystal on the stainless steel model.<br/>
<br/>
<h3 id="how_to_decide_on_an_apple_watch_color">How to Decide on an Apple Watch Color</h3><br/>
It is important to consider which band you plan to use with your Apple Watch to ensure that they complement each other. You may prefer more neutral tones such as Midnight or Silver, and then use a more colorful band. Alternatively, you could choose a more striking device color like Pink, and then use a more neutral band. This is also a key consideration if you plan to switch bands regularly.<br/>
<br/>
Silver on both the aluminum and stainless steel models may age better over time as new devices are released since they are more neutral, monochrome shades, and have been offered across multiple Apple Watch generations.<br/>
<br/>
Pink could be a good choice, especially when combined with the Pink Sport Band, for a bold look, especially if you also have a Pink &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; or &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; Plus. If you want an Apple Watch in a brand new shade, Pink is also the only option. It is the color that is most noticeably new and indicates that you have the latest-generation device.<br/>
<br/>
Your choice of color may also be dependent on how often you upgrade your ‌Apple Watch. If you upgrade every year or two, you may be more confident in buying a more striking new color. If you upgrade more often, it can be a good idea to get a different color every time since a new color can certainly add some novelty to purchasing a new ‌Apple Watch and make it feel more different from your previous device. Alternatively, if you plan to keep your ‌Apple Watch for many years and upgrade less often, it may be wiser to consider a neutral color or one that is more similar to one you have enjoyed previously.<br/>
<br/>
Customers with multiple Apple devices may also want to get an Apple Watch color that complements their other devices. For example, if you have a Midnight <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod/">HomePod</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/">MacBook Air</a>, it will be best complemented by the Midnight &zwnj;Apple Watch Series 9&zwnj;. If you already have a Gold &zwnj;iPhone 14&zwnj; Pro, it will likely be best accompanied by a Gold stainless steel &zwnj;Apple Watch Series 9&zwnj;. Likewise, if you have a Starlight Apple Watch, it will obviously match the Starlight &zwnj;iPhone 14&zwnj; and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-mini/">iPad mini</a>.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch/">Apple Watch Series 9</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch">Apple Watch (Buy Now)</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-watch-series-9-colors-and-finishes/">Apple Watch Series 9 Colors and Finishes: Which Should You Choose?</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-watch-series-9-colors-and-finishes-which-should-you-choose.2403871/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[In a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs6nA1egGWg">video interview with Brian Tong</a>, Apple's VP of Sensing and Connectivity Ron Huang explained why only the updated second-generation AirPods Pro with a USB-C charging case <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/13/apple-vision-pro-lossless-new-airpods-pro-2-only/">support lossless audio with Apple's upcoming Vision Pro headset</a>.<br/>
<br/>

Huang revealed that the H2 chip in the USB-C AirPods Pro supports the 5GHz band of wireless frequencies for ultra-low latency and less interference, while the H2 chip in the original second-generation AirPods Pro with a Lightning case is limited to the 2.4GHz band. Apple says it is this 5GHz support that enables the updated AirPods Pro to support lossless audio with the Vision Pro, which is slated for release in the U.S. in early 2024.<br/>
<br/>
The topic is briefly discussed at around the 26-minute mark of the video, as highlighted by <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2023/09/22/airpods-pro-2-apple-vision-pro-lossless-explanation/"><em>9to5Mac</em>'s Zac Hall</a> earlier today:<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Amazon has all-time low prices on Apple's new 15.3-inch MacBook Air notebooks, with the highlight of the sale being a new &#36;250 discount on the 512GB model. You can get the 512GB 15.3-inch MacBook Air for <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0C76D4RWJ%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"><strong>&#36;1,249.00</strong></a>, down from &#36;1,499.00.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/MacBook-Air-15-Inch-Feature-Purple.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="894" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-898576" /><em><small>Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with Amazon. When you click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment, which helps us keep the site running.</small></em><br/>
<br/>
This sale is available in all four colors: Space Gray, Midnight, Starlight, and Silver. All models are in stock and have an estimated delivery date between September 24 and September 28. These notebooks debuted in June and this is a new all-time low price on the 512GB model.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0C75NTC96%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1"target="_blank"><div class="fancybutton"><div class="fancybadge">&#36;250 OFF</div>15-inch MacBook Air (512GB) for &#36;1,249.00</div></a></div><br/>
<br/>
Additionally, Amazon has the 256GB 15.3-inch MacBook Air on sale for <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0C75NSLJY%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"><strong>&#36;1,099.00</strong></a>, down from &#36;1,299.00. This one is available in two colors (Midnight and Starlight), and has an estimated delivery date between September 24 and September 28 as well.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0C75NSLJY%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"target="_blank"><div class="fancybutton"><div class="fancybadge">&#36;200 OFF</div>15-inch MacBook Air (256GB) for &#36;1,099.00</div></a></div><br/>
<br/>
The new MacBook Air features a large 15.3-inch Liquid Retina display, M2 processor, six-speaker system, two Thunderbolt ports, a 3.5mm headphone jack, and MagSafe. The 15.3-inch MacBook Air is mostly similar to the 2022 13.6-inch MacBook Air, but there are some key differences that we highlighted <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/13-vs-15-inch-macbook-air/">in our buyer's guide</a>.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[If you are unboxing an iPhone 15, iPhone 15 Plus, iPhone 15 Pro, or iPhone 15 Pro Max today, make sure to update the device to iOS 17.0.2 before transferring data to the device from another iPhone, or else you <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT213933">might encounter issues</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/Update-Your-iPhone-15-to-iOS-17.0.2-Before-Transferring-Data-From-Another-iPhone-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-913145" /><br/>
iOS 17.0.2 is only available for the iPhone 15 lineup. Apple <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT213781">says</a> the update fixes an issue that may prevent transferring data directly from another iPhone during the device setup process, so installing it is very important. The update should appear during the setup process, or it can be installed via the Settings app under General → Software Update if you proceeded to set up the device as new and transfer data later.<br/>
<br/>
If you already attempted to transfer data from another iPhone before updating to iOS 17.0.2, and your iPhone 15 is now stuck showing an Apple logo, Apple has shared a new <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT213933">support document</a> with steps on how to restore the iPhone:<blockquote>1. Connect your new iPhone to a computer with a cable.<br/>
2. Press and quickly release the volume up button. Press and quickly release the volume down button. Then, press and hold the side button. <br/>
3. Continue to hold while the Apple logo appears and don't let go until an image of a computer and cable appears.<br/>
4. On your computer, locate your new iPhone in the Finder or in iTunes. <br/>
5. Choose Restore when you see the option to Restore or Update.</blockquote>After restoring the iPhone 15 and updating it to iOS 17.0.2, the process of transferring data from another iPhone can be restarted.<br/>
<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Happy launch day! The new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a>, &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; Plus, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a>, and &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; Max devices are in the hands of Apple customers as of today. We'll have a full unboxing coming later, but we thought we'd take a quick look at the star of today's launch, the &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; Max.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7aoLVRpCjxQ" title="5 Best iPhone 15 Pro Max Features!" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe><em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/macrumors?sub_confirmation=1">Subscribe to the MacRumors YouTube channel</a> for more videos.</em></div><br/>
Of the four new iPhones that Apple made available today, the 15 Pro Max has the best feature set and it's the device to choose if you want top-of-the-line capabilities. Here's why it stands out:<br/>
<ul><br/>
 	<li><strong>USB-C Port</strong> - With USB-C, you can charge your <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>, and Mac with the same USB-C to USB-C cable. The &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; can also be used to charge devices like the AirPods and the Apple Watch, and on the Pro and Pro Max, you can transfer content at up to 10Gb/s with an appropriate cable.</li><br/>
 	<li><strong>Action Button</strong> - The Action Button replaces the mute switch on the Pro models. It can be set to do all kinds of things like activate a Focus mode, turn on the camera, turn on the Flashlight, activate a Shortcut, and more.</li><br/>
 	<li><strong>A17 Pro Chip</strong> - The A17 Pro chip enables console gaming on the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; for the first time with support for hardware-accelerated ray tracing. You'll be able to play games like Resident Evil 4 and Death Stranding, and it's going to be just blazing fast for checking email, sending text messages, and scrolling social networks.</li><br/>
 	<li><strong>Titanium</strong> - The &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; and Pro Max have a titanium chassis that's lighter than the stainless steel chassis, so even though these iPhones are the same size as last year's iPhones, they'll feel less weighty in the hand. As a bonus, Apple changed the design to make them more repairable so it's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/17/iphone-15-pro-cracked-glass-repair-fees-lower/">less expensive</a> if you break the back glass. Other design changes include more contoured edges and slimmer display bezels.</li><br/>
 	<li><strong>5x Telephoto Lens</strong> - The 5x telephoto lens is a Pro Max exclusive feature, with the standard 15 Pro limited to 3x optical zoom. 5x optical zoom was made possible with Apple's new tetraprism technology so you can zoom in further than ever before. You'll get 25x zoom in total, and Apple also made a bunch of other improvements to the camera that you can see <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">detailed in our iPhone 15 Pro roundup</a>.</li><br/>
</ul><br/>
With all of the features available in the &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; plus a larger battery because of more physical space, a larger 6.7-inch display, and the 5x Telephoto lens, the &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; Max is hard to beat.

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's retail employees are receiving raises between two and five percent this year, which is a smaller pay increase than Apple provided during the pandemic, reports <em><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-09-21/apple-stores-give-out-smaller-raises-in-post-pandemic-slowdown">Bloomberg</a></em>. Annual raises are at about four percent on average, with the increases applying to retail employees and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/applecare/">AppleCare</a> technical support employees.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/03/apple-store-palo-alto.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-786171" /><br/>
Raises are provided alongside employee reviews, which are done in the fall. Last year, Apple was offering bigger raises of eight to 10 percent to combat labor shortages and employee unionization efforts, but as <em>Bloomberg</em> notes, unionization campaigns have not gained traction and wage growth in the United States is down.<br/>
<br/>
Most of Apple's retail employees in the United States earn now &#36;22 to &#36;30 per hour, and are given restricted stock units valued at up to &#36;2,000 annually. <br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/21/apple-retail-employees-2023-raises/">Apple Retail Employees Getting Smaller Raises of Approximately 4% in 2023</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-retail-employees-getting-smaller-raises-of-approximately-4-in-2023.2403745/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[In a <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207123">support document</a> updated today, Apple indicates that fingerprints might "temporarily alter the color" of the titanium frame on the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max. Fortunately, Apple says this is not a permanent condition, as the fingerprints can be wiped off just like on any other iPhone to restore a clean finish.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/iPhone-15-Pro-Fingerprints.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-913020" /><br/>
"For iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max, the oil from your skin might temporarily alter the color of the outside band," says Apple. "Wiping your iPhone with a soft, slightly damp, lint-free cloth will restore the original look."<br/>
<br/>
Photos of iPhone 15 Pro models with visible fingerprints on the titanium frame have been circulating on social media since the devices were announced last week, but customers should not be concerned about permanent damage. None of this information should be a surprise, but now it is on the record from Apple.<br/>
<br/>
All of the iPhone 15 models launch this Friday, with orders already beginning to arrive to customers <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/21/iphone-15-orders-nz-australia/">in Australia and New Zealand</a>.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-15-Pro">iPhone 15 Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/21/apple-on-iphone-15-pro-fingerprints/">Apple Says Fingerprints Can &#039;Temporarily Alter the Color&#039; of iPhone 15 Pro&#039;s Titanium Frame</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-says-fingerprints-can-temporarily-alter-the-color-of-iphone-15-pros-titanium-frame.2403741/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It is already Friday, September 22 in New Zealand and Australia, which means customers in those countries who pre-ordered an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch/">Apple Watch Series 9</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch-ultra/">Apple Watch Ultra 2</a>, or <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/">AirPods Pro</a> with USB-C case are beginning to receive their devices.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/iphone-15-blue-23.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-911509" /><br/>
Apple fans receiving new &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/iphone/comments/16oq5gz/just_received_the_new_iphone_in_new_zealand/">are now sharing</a> photos and first impressions on Instagram, Twitter, Reddit, the <em>MacRumors</em> forums, and other social networks. If you've already received your new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>, let us know in the comments below and make sure to share pictures and your first impressions!<br/>
<br/>
There are no Apple retail locations in New Zealand, which means customers in Australia are always the first to be able to pick up new devices or purchase an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; in an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-store/">Apple Store</a>. Available in-store stock in Australia will provide insight into what we can expect in other Apple Stores around the world.<br/>
<br/>
&zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; Max models sold out during the pre-order period, and orders placed now from Apple's online store will not ship out until late October or even into November for some devices. The standard &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; models are not as hard to come by.<br/>
<br/>
If you missed out on pre-orders, purchasing at an &zwnj;Apple Store&zwnj; or another location like Target, Walmart, or Best Buy is the only way to get a new &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; on launch day. While retail stores are expected to have stock, popular &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; Max models could be in short supply and may sell out quickly.<br/>
<br/>
Following New Zealand and Australia, sales and deliveries of the new &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; models and the new Apple Watches will begin in Asia, the Middle East, Europe, and finally, North America. Many Apple Stores worldwide will be opening up early at around 8:00 a.m. local time to allow customers to pick up reserved devices and make walk-in purchases.<br/>
<br/>
Make sure to stay tuned to <em>MacRumors</em>, as we'll have a hands-on and unboxing tomorrow, followed by deep dives into the feature set of the new devices, camera comparisons, and more.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-15">iPhone 15 (Buy Now)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-15-Pro">iPhone 15 Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99">iPhone</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/21/iphone-15-orders-nz-australia/">First iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Pro Orders Arriving to Customers in Australia and New Zealand</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/first-iphone-15-and-iphone-15-pro-orders-arriving-to-customers-in-australia-and-new-zealand.2403731/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/pixel-pals-widget.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-912995" /><br/>
With Pixel Pals 2.0, you can adopt a digital pet that lives on your &zwnj;Home Screen&zwnj;, and you can interact with it in all new ways without the need to open up the app.<br/>
<br/>
You can feed and play with your Pixel Pals, and add your friends so their Pixel Pals can visit your &zwnj;Home Screen&zwnj;. Two Pixel Pals together can battle one another, and in StandBy mode, your Pixel Pal can hang out next to you or you can use a new sheep counting feature.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I just released Pixel Pals 2! &#x1f389; With iOS 17 you now have a FULL virtual pets experience where you can add and battle friends, and play full games, like PixelQuest, 2048, and Eternal Stroll, all right on your literal home screen! (Plus fidget spinners, mech keyboards, and more!) <a href="https://t.co/BAFmERPpXu">pic.twitter.com/BAFmERPpXu</a></p>&mdash; Christian Selig (@ChristianSelig) <a href="https://twitter.com/ChristianSelig/status/1704937324168004016?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 21, 2023</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> </div><br/>
You can also plant seeds on a farm to grow food for your pet, and there are new animals and morphs to unlock. As your friendship with your Pixel Pal grows, you will unlock more morphs. Selig has also added in full games that can be played on the &zwnj;Home Screen&zwnj; in a widget, including PixelQuest, 2048, and Eternal Scroll.<br/>
<br/>
Christian Selig is the developer behind the now-defunct Apollo app for Reddit, which was removed for sale earlier this year. He is now focusing his attention on Pixel Pals.<br/>
<br/>
Pixel Pals is <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/pixel-pals-widget-activity/id6443919232">free to download</a>, but unlocking the app's full feature set requires Pixel Pals Premium, priced at &#36;9.99 per year or &#36;1.49 per month.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/21/pixel-pals-2-interactive-widgets/">Pixel Pals 2 Brings an Interactive Friend to Your Home Screen Widgets</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/pixel-pals-2-brings-an-interactive-friend-to-your-home-screen-widgets.2403719/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/12/apple-watch-series-9-double-tap/">Double Tap gesture</a> for the Apple Watch Series 9 and the Apple Watch Ultra 2 will be enabled starting with watchOS 10.1, according to Marques Brownlee, host of the popular tech-focused YouTube channel MKBHD.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/Apple-Watch-Ultra-2-double-tap-gesture-230912.jpg" alt="" width="1960" height="1102" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-910334" /><br/>
The first beta of watchOS 10.1 will likely be available by next week, and Apple announced that the software update will be released next month.<br/>
<br/>
Brownlee shared his impressions of the Series 9 and Ultra 2 in the video below, which was <a href="https://twitter.com/M1Astra/status/1704926733307084862">highlighted by @M1Astra</a> on X, formerly Twitter.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oNCs4C2SMjo?si=qCiHzZDvwasjRE07" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><br/>
Double Tap will allow users to tap their watch hand's index finger and thumb together twice to perform common actions on the Apple Watch, such as stopping a timer, playing and pausing music, snoozing an alarm, answering and ending a phone call, opening the Smart Stack, and more, all without touching the screen.<br/>
<br/>
Apple says Double Tap is enabled by the S9 chip's faster Neural Engine, so the feature is only available on the Series 9 and Ultra 2. Apple said it developed an algorithm that detects the "unique signature" of tiny wrist movements and changes in blood flow when the index finger and thumb are tapped together.<br/>
<br/>
A similar but more limited <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/use-hand-gestures-control-apple-watch/">accessibility feature called AssistiveTouch</a> is already available on the Apple Watch Series 4 and newer.<br/>
<br/>
Both new Apple Watch models launch this Friday, but Double Tap will require watchOS 10.1. For now, the latest version is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/21/apple-releases-watchos-10-0-1/">watchOS 10.0.1</a>, released today.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch/">Apple Watch Series 9</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/double-tap/">Double Tap</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch">Apple Watch (Buy Now)</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/21/watchos-10-1-double-tap/">watchOS 10.1 to Enable Apple Watch&#039;s New &#039;Double Tap&#039; Gesture</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/watchos-10-1-to-enable-apple-watchs-new-double-tap-gesture.2403716/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Google is continuing on with its relentless #GetTheMessage marketing campaign in an attempt to get Apple to adopt the RCS messaging protocol. In its latest ad, Google shows off the "iPager," which Google describes as a device that "uses outdated messaging tech" like Apple uses "when texting with Android."<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe title="Meet iPager - Help Apple #GetTheMessage" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/N_B0riy__rw" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" data-thumb-size="hqdefault"></iframe></div><br/>
RCS, or Rich Communication Services, is a communication protocol designed by and adopted by Google. Google has been pushing Apple to implement support for RCS, but Apple devices continue to support the older SMS protocol. Google claims that Apple is responsible for all the issues that Android and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> users have texting one another, including lack of encryption, broken group chats, pixelated pictures and videos, and the green bubbles.<br/>
<br/>
"iPager isn't real, but the problems that Apple causes by using SMS are. Let's make texting better for everyone and help Apple #GetTheMessage and upgrade to RCS," read's Google's video.<br/>
<br/>
Major U.S. carriers and other carriers worldwide have adopted support for RCS, but Apple has no plans to do so despite <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/01/04/google-apple-rcs-billboard-message/">Google's multi-year effort</a>. Google has used billboards, ads, websites, social media campaigns, and more to get Apple's attention and to try to convince &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; users to request the feature from Apple, but so far, it hasn't worked.<br/>
<br/>
In September 2022, Apple CEO <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tim-cook/">Tim Cook</a> said that RCS is not a priority for Apple. "I don't hear our users asking that we put a lot of energy in on that at this point," he explained. To one reporter who said he was having an issue texting his mother on an Android device, Cook said "Buy your mom an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;."<br/>
<br/>
It is not clear if Apple will ever adopt RCS, but so far, it does not sound like the company has any interest in doing so. If Apple did adopt RCS, it would allow for end-to-end encryption for conversations between &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; and Android users, as well as higher quality media. Apple already offers these features for the iMessage service that works from &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; to &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/google/">Google</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/messages/">Messages</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/rcs/">RCS</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/21/google-ipager-ad-rcs-apple/">Google&#039;s New &#039;iPager&#039; Ad Shames Apple for Using Outdated Messaging Standard</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/googles-new-ipager-ad-shames-apple-for-using-outdated-messaging-standard.2403708/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today seeded a second release candidate version of the upcoming macOS 14 Sonoma update to developers for testing purposes. The software update comes over a week after the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/12/apple-seeds-macos-sonoma-14-rc/">launch of the first RC</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-900182" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/macos-sonoma-4.jpg" alt="" width="2336" height="1314" /><br/>
Registered developers can download the beta through the Apple Developer Center and after the appropriate profile is installed, with the betas available through the Software Update mechanism in System Settings.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sonoma/">macOS Sonoma</a> introduces new Apple TV-like screen savers that also serve as wallpapers after you log in, plus it moves widgets to the desktop. You can use the new widget gallery to choose from a range of widgets, and then drag them to your Mac's desktop.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/home-screen/">Widgets</a> can be arranged in any way that's useful, and when you're using an app, they are designed to fade into the background so they're less distracting. &zwnj;Widgets&zwnj; are more interactive than before, so you can use them to do things like play music, turn off the lights in your home, and more. Through Continuity, your <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>'s widgets can also show up on your Mac's desktop.<br/>
<br/>
Video conferencing has improved with a new Presenter Overlay view that shows your desktop or project in new ways, plus Safari now supports web apps for the Dock and the option to create Profiles so you can separate personal browsing from work browsing.<br/>
<br/>
Other new features include improved search that's faster and more responsive, password and passkey sharing, a revamped stickers interface for the Messages app, PDF integration in notes that makes it easier than ever to manage PDFs, and more.<br/>
<br/>
&zwnj;macOS Sonoma&zwnj; is set to see a launch on September 26.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sonoma/">macOS Sonoma</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macos-sonoma.243">macOS Sonoma</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/21/apple-releases-second-macos-sonoma-rc/">Apple Seeds Second Release Candidate Version of macOS 14 Sonoma to Developers</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-seeds-second-release-candidate-version-of-macos-14-sonoma-to-developers.2403685/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-818315" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/09/iWork-macOS-Trio-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2250" height="1266" /><br/>
On the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; and the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj;, the three iWork apps now support 3D objects in the USDZ file format. Apple says that these can be added to documents to "bring new dimensions" to your work. In Keynote specifically, embedded animations within USDZ files can be played, or Magic Move can be used to animate 3D objects across slides.<br/>
<br/>
The apps support Stickers through the updated emoji interface that allows both stickers and emoji to be used throughout the iOS operating system, plus there are inline predictions for text as you type with <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a> or <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-17/">iPadOS 17</a> installed.<br/>
<br/>
Other new features include options to collaborate on documents over <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/facetime/">FaceTime</a>, the ability to find and open suggested documents when using Spotlight, and an option to drag documents to the Keynote/Pages/Numbers icon on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/home-screen/">Home Screen</a> to import them. Pages also supports new paragraph style options and has a Minimalist Report template, while Keynote has new dynamic themes and live video slide layouts.<br/>
<br/>
On the Mac, Pages, Numbers, and Keynote also now support USDZ files, and the same themes and templates have also been added to Pages and Keynote.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[YouTube channel PBKreviews today shared a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqKYG4HRGEY">teardown of the iPhone 15 Pro</a>, providing a look inside the device. Overall, the iPhone 15 Pro has a similar internal design as the iPhone 14 Pro, but with a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/17/iphone-15-pro-cracked-glass-repair-fees-lower/">redesigned mid-frame chassis</a> that allows for the back glass panel to be easily removed from the device during repairs.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/iPhone-15-Pro-Teardown.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-912884" /><br/>
The teardown confirms that the iPhone 15 Pro is equipped with a 3,274 mAh battery, as revealed <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/15/iphone-15-battery-capacities-revealed/">in a regulatory database last week</a>. While the iPhone 15 Pro has a slightly larger battery than the 3,200 mAh battery in the iPhone 14 Pro, Apple says both devices have the same battery life, with up to 23 hours of offline video playback.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aqKYG4HRGEY?si=Grjhsv1_eLCx9RgP" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><br/>
Since this is an iPhone 15 Pro teardown, there is no look at Apple's new tetraprism lens system, which enables 5x optical zoom on the iPhone 15 Pro Max.<br/>
<br/>
The video provides a brief look at the iPhone 15 Pro's logic board with Apple's new A17 Pro chip, but few other details can be garnered. Repair website iFixit will likely share a more in-depth teardown of the device by next week.<br/>
