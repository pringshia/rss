		<description><![CDATA[Apple has researched a MacBook keyboard that features a removable key designed to be used as a precision mouse, according to a newly granted patent application.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/08/removable-key-patent-1.jpg" alt="" width="1870" height="975" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-812359" /><br/>
The patent, first spotted by <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/21/08/19/future-apple-keyboard-could-have-one-key-that-can-pop-out-and-be-used-as-a-mouse"><em>AppleInsider</em></a>, is titled "<a href="https://image-ppubs.uspto.gov/dirsearch-public/print/downloadPdf/11782519">Deployable Key Mouse</a>." Apple first <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/19/macbook-could-feature-removable-key/">applied for the patent</a> in 2021 and it was today granted by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.<br/>
<br/>
The patent envisages a seemingly conventional MacBook scissor-system keyboard that features a hidden removable key. This key would be designed to be used as a pointing device and contain a position sensor. Apple describes the system as providing a "comfortable, portable, and precise pointer input for a computer input system."<br/>
<br/>
The filing argues that some precise tasks, such as graphic design, computer-assisted design and modeling, and editing large and complex documents, are better suited to a handheld mouse than a trackpad. Apple acknowledges that carrying a separate mouse with the computer can be burdensome and may be "redundant when the computer already has built-in pointing devices."<br/>
<br/>
The removable key is a viable solution to this issue, according to Apple. In some embodiments, the key would be able to work as normal on the keyboard when it is not deployed and feature a small internal battery.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/08/removable-key-patent-2.jpg" alt="" width="1870" height="1200" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-812360" /><br/>
Apple outlines various mechanical systems to facilitate the removable key, including sliding a single or set of multiple keys out of the housing vertically, as well as sliding a key out from the side of the machine horizontally. The patent's illustrations show the deployable key located toward the edge of the keyboard so that it would not be a key that sees near constant use.<br/>
<br/>
Patent filings cannot be taken as evidence of Apple's immediate plans, but they do indicate areas of interest for the company and what it is considering developing behind the scenes. While the prospect of a removable key may seem like an outlandish potential MacBook feature, Apple is clearly interested enough in the prospect as to patent the concept. It may be less obtrusive than other unusual features such as the Touch Bar and could appeal to certain pro-users who require maximum portability but could still benefit from occasional precise input.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/patent/">Patent</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/10/future-macbook-removable-key-patent/">Removable Key That Works as a Mouse Could Come to Future MacBook</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/removable-key-that-works-as-a-mouse-could-come-to-future-macbook.2407077/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Amazon's second major discount event of the year has kicked off, and in this article we're focusing on accessory discounts for smartphones, tablets, smartwatches, and more that are available during Prime Big Deal Days. You'll need an Amazon Prime membership to access the sale, and <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Famazonprime"><strong>you can sign up for Prime on Amazon</strong></a>. There's a 30 day free trial, and the service costs &#36;14.99/month thereafter, or &#36;139/year.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/Prime-Big-Deal-Days-Feature-1.jpg" alt="" width="2002" height="1126" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-915753" /><em><small>Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with Amazon.

<br/>
As is typical for Prime Day deals, these markdowns are very time sensitive, so sales listed below may disappear fast, and new ones may appear even faster. With this in mind, we'll keep this article updated throughout the event, and keep an eye on the MacRumors front page as we'll be posting particularly great deals in separate articles this week.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Anker</h2><br/>

<br/>
As always, some of the best overall deals you'll find during Prime Day will be on Anker accessories. This season, the highlight of the sale is Anker's new <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB09TT8GZK9%3Fref%3Dt_ac_view_request_product_image%26campaignId%3Damzn1.campaign.1HY9ZNVDCHPZF%26linkCode%3Dtr1%26tag%3Dweeno%26linkId%3Damzn1.campaign.1HY9ZNVDCHPZF_1696870847309">MagSafe 3-in-1 Charger Stand</a>, which is on sale at &#36;112.46, down from &#36;149.95. This is a new all-time low price, beating the deal we tracked last month by about &#36;7. Remember you'll need to be signed into a Prime account to see this deal.<br/>
<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Amazon is hosting another Prime Day event this year, called <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2F">Amazon Prime Big Deal Days</a> and offering shoppers the first chance to save on holiday shopping from a major retailer. Similar to the first Prime Day, it will last for two days and you'll find a large selection of deals and offers across Amazon's storefront, covering savings on tech, clothing, video games, groceries, and much, much more.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/Prime-Big-Deal-Days-Feature-1.jpg" alt="" width="2002" height="1126" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-915753" /><em><small>Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with Amazon. When you click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment, which helps us keep the site running.</small></em><br/>
<br/>
For our coverage, we're focusing entirely on Apple and Apple-related discounts that can be purchased during this 48-hour event on Amazon. As of today, this includes deals on AirPods, Apple Watch, iPad, and MacBook Air.<br/>
<br/>
As is typical for Prime Day deals, these markdowns are very time sensitive, so sales listed below may disappear fast, and new ones may appear even faster. With this in mind, we'll keep this article updated throughout the event, and keep an eye on the MacRumors front page as we'll be posting particularly great deals in separate articles this week.<br/>
<br/>
Lastly, and perhaps most importantly, <strong>Amazon Prime Big Deal Days requires you to have an Amazon Prime membership to take advantage of the discounts</strong>. Amazon Prime offers a <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Famazonprime%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26geniuslink%3Dtrue"><strong>one month free trial</strong></a>, and otherwise costs &#36;14.99 per month or &#36;139.00 per year.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>AirPods</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/prime-day-airpods-pro-2.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-915882" /><br/>
<br/>
AirPods are always a hot item during holiday discount events, and Amazon is bringing this trend back for 2023 with solid markdowns on AirPods Pro 2, AirPods 2, and AirPods 3. The highlight this time around is the new AirPods Pro 2 with USB-C at &#36;189.00, &#36;60 off and their best price ever.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Amazon's Prime Big Deal Days event has kicked off today, and a major new discount has hit a popular model of AirPods. You can get the AirPods Pro 2 with USB-C/MagSafe Charging Case for <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0CHWRXH8B%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"><strong>&#36;189.00</strong></a>, down from &#36;249.00.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/prime-day-airpods-pro-2.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-915882" /><em><small>Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with Amazon. When you click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment, which helps us keep the site running.</small></em><br/>
<br/>
This is the lowest price we've ever tracked for the AirPods Pro 2 with USB-C. Apple just launched these earbuds last month and their headlining new feature is the addition of a USB-C port on the MagSafe Charging Case, replacing the Lightning port.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0CHWRXH8B%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"target="_blank"><div class="fancybutton"><div class="fancybadge">&#36;60 OFF</div>AirPods Pro 2 (USB-C) for &#36;189.00</div></a></div><br/>
<br/>
There are a few minor changes to the AirPods Pro 2 besides the addition of USB-C, including additional dust resistance and support for lossless audio with the Vision Pro headset. Apple doesn't sell the USB-C/MagSafe Charging Case separately, so if you want USB-C support you'll have to purchase a full new set of earbuds.<br/>
<br/>

		<title>Upcoming iPad Mini 7 Still Rumored to Lack 120Hz ProMotion Display</title>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple is rumored to be launching a new seventh-generation iPad mini soon, but the new model will not feature a 120Hz ProMotion display, claims a leaker with alleged supply chain sources.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/09/ipad-mini-9.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-818328" /><br/>
According to the Twitter account <a href="https://x.com/Tech_Reve/status/1711700735073890720?s=20">@Tech_Reve</a>, the iPad mini 7 "still doesn't have 120Hz," with only the A-series processor expected to receive an upgrade. <br/>
<br/>
Suggestions that Apple could conceivably adopt ProMotion for a next-generation ‌iPad mini‌ began to receive attention when the "<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/27/ipad-mini-6-jelly-scroll-issue-vertical/">jelly scrolling</a>" phenomenon was identified shortly after the iPad mini 6 was released in September 2021. <br/>
<br/>
"Jelly scrolling" refers to screen tearing, which can cause text or images on one side of the screen to appear to be tilted downwards because of a mismatch in refresh rates. It can cause one side of the display to look as if it's responding faster than the other side, a visual disturbance that's hard to miss once you notice it.<br/>
<br/>
Apple says the phenomenon is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/28/apple-jelly-scrolling-normal-behavior/">normal behavior</a> for LCD iPads. Since LCD screens refresh line by line, there is a tiny delay between when the lines at the top and lines at the bottom are refreshed. But while this may be normal behavior for LCD screens, it can appear more obvious when observed on the ‌‌iPad mini's smaller screen‌‌.<br/>
<br/>
Late last year, a rumor on Korean forums suggested Apple was testing a Samsung-supplied display for a future ‌‌iPad mini‌‌ that would allow for up to 120Hz refresh rates, but no such model has been forthcoming, and Apple's plans for the iPad mini are still unclear, and rumors of an update have only gathered pace over the last couple of months. <br/>
<br/>
<em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman earlier this year <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/01/08/airpods-apple-watch-ipad-apple-tv-2023/">reported</a> that an iPad mini update with a minor "spec bump" is not out of the question in 2024. More recently in August, the leaker known as "ShrimpApplePro" <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/01/ipad-mini-7-could-be-coming-later-this-year/">suggested</a> a seventh-generation iPad mini was in the works at Apple, and said that they had seen evidence that at least one new iPad model is coming this year. A <em>DigiTimes</em> report last month <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/25/apple-ipad-mini-7-release-late-2023/">said</a> Apple plans to release a "small-sized iPad" in the fourth quarter, while <em>9to5Mac</em> just last week <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/05/apple-two-ipad-air-models/">said</a> that its sources believe the ‌iPad mini‌ 7 is coming "soon."<br/>
<br/>
If anything happens before the holidays, a chip upgrade may be the most likely feature of a new ‌iPad mini‌. The ‌sixth-generation iPad mini‌ currently contains the A15 Bionic chip, while the new iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Pro use the A16 and A17 Pro chip, respectively. A minor spec bump could also include upgrades to the front and rear cameras, potentially bringing features like Photonic Engine to the ‌iPad‌ for the first time.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-mini/">iPad mini</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPad_Mini">iPad Mini (Caution)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipad.137">iPad</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/10/ipad-mini-7-no-promotion-display/">Upcoming iPad Mini 7 Still Rumored to Lack 120Hz ProMotion Display</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/upcoming-ipad-mini-7-still-rumored-to-lack-120hz-promotion-display.2407031/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[EU antitrust regulators have asked Apple's users and rivals to rate the importance of Apple's iMessage and Microsoft's Bing versus competing services, reports <em><a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/should-new-tech-rules-apply-microsofts-bing-apples-imessage-eu-asks-2023-10-09/">Reuters</a></em>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/06/iMessages-Microsoft-feature.jpg" alt="" width="2446" height="1369" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-805825" /><br/>
According to people familiar with the matter, the European Commission sent out the questionnaires earlier this month, asking if there was anything specific to iMessage and Microsoft's Bing, Edge, and Microsoft Advertising that business users rely on and how they fit into the companies' ecosystems. The survey also asked for the number of users making use of the services.<br/>
<br/>
The survey comes after Apple and Microsoft contested the EU regulator labeling them as "gatekeepers" ahead of the publication of the first list of services to be regulated by the Digital Markets Act (DMA). Apple last month <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/05/imessage-isnt-popular-enough-for-regulation/">argued</a> that iMessage does not meet the number of users required for the DMA's rules to apply, and should not be obliged to comply with it.<br/>
<br/>
The legislation introduces new rules that apply to services considered to be core platform services and forces them to open up their various services and platforms to other companies and developers. For example, Apple could be forced to allow third-party companies and rival apps like Meta's WhatsApp to integrate directly with iMessage.<br/>
<br/>
Analysts estimate that iMessage has as many as one billion users around the world, but Apple has not disclosed any official numbers about the service for several years. Whether iMessage will be included on the EU's initial list of gatekeeper services will depend on how it defines the market in which it operates.<br/>
<br/>
Apple is expected to add support for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/17/app-sideloading-support-coming-ios-17/">sideloading apps</a> from outside the ‌<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a>‌ on iPhones and iPads in Europe via an update to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a> due to the DMA's requirements, which could ultimately force similar major changes to the way in which the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj;, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/facetime/">FaceTime</a>, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a> work on Apple devices. <br/>
<br/>
Survey respondents were given less than a week to provide feedback, and the Commission wants to complete its investigation "within five months," according to the report.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/imessage/">iMessage</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/european-union/">European Union</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/european-commission/">European Commission</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/antitrust/">Apple Antitrust</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/10/eu-asks-imessage-users-service-regulation/">EU Asks iMessage Users and Rivals If Service Should Be Regulated</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/eu-asks-imessage-users-and-rivals-if-service-should-be-regulated.2407027/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Valve on Monday said it has no plans for a macOS version of the recently released game <em>Counter-Strike 2</em>, the follow-up title replacing the hugely popular FPS <em>Counter-Strike: Global Offensive</em>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/counter-srike-21.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="450" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-914773" /><br/>
Valve confirmed its decision and gave its reasons in a newly published <a href="https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/73EF-08A3-0935-6369">Steam support FAQ</a>:<br/>
<blockquote>As technology advances, we have made the difficult decision to discontinue support for older hardware, including DirectX 9 and 32-bit operating systems. Similarly, we will no longer support macOS. Combined, these represented less than one percent of active CS:GO players.<br/>
<br/>
Moving forward, Counter-Strike 2 will exclusively support 64-bit Windows and Linux.</blockquote>Last month's release of <em>Counter-Strike 2</em> forced a 26GB update for everyone with <em>CS:GO</em>, including Mac users, but after installation those on macOS soon discovered that the update <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/30/counter-strike-2-no-mac-version-available/">makes the original game as well as the update unplayable</a> because of the lack of support and no rollback option. <br/>
<br/>
Valve now says Mac players will be eligible for a Prime Status Upgrade refund if most of their <em>CS:GO</em> playtime was on macOS and they played <em>CS:GO</em> on a Mac between the announcement of the <em>Counter-Strike 2</em> Limited Test (March 22, 2023) and the launch of <em>Counter-Strike 2</em> (September 27, 2023), regardless of when they purchased their Prime Status Upgrade. Valve will offer the refunds until December 1, 2023.<br/>
<br/>
Valve added that those who wish to continue playing <em>CS:GO</em> on macOS will be able to access a legacy version or "frozen build" of the game, which has all the features of <em>CS:GO</em> except for official matchmaking. Support for this version of <em>CS:GO</em> will end on January 1, 2024. After this date, the game will still be available, but certain functionality that relies on compatibility with the Game Coordinator (e.g., access to inventory) may degrade and/or fail, according to Valve.<br/>
<br/>
Despite Valve's refund offer to Mac users, the news that a macOS version of <em>Counter-Strike 2</em> is not in active development will come as a bitter blow to many players. Though <em>CS:GO</em> launched all the way back in 2012, it's still one of the most popular FPS games available today, with tens of millions of players logging in each month. So even if less than 1 percent of the user base is on Mac, that could still account for hundreds of thousands of players.<br/>
<br/>
Regardless of numbers, one of the reasons Valve is reluctant to develop <em>CS2</em> for Mac is that Apple devices do not provide native support for the Vulkan API that the game is based on. Vulkan was designed to succeed OpenGL and address some of the latter's shortcomings, and while there is an open-source library called MoltenVK that provides a Vulkan implementation on top of Apple's Metal graphics API, it still lacks some of Vulkan's advanced features.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/valve/">Valve</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/10/valve-confirms-counter-strike-2-no-macos/">Valve Says Counter-Strike 2 for macOS Not Happening Because There Aren&#039;t Enough Players on Mac to Justify It</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/valve-says-counter-strike-2-for-macos-not-happening-because-there-arent-enough-players-on-mac-to-justify-it.2407023/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The Vision Pro headset that Apple plans to release next year has displays that support up to a 100Hz refresh rate, according to code in the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/03/apple-releases-visionos-beta-4/">latest beta of visionOS</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/vision-pro-headset-1.jpg" alt="" width="2698" height="1518" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-898460" /><br/>
Apple says that the Vision Pro headset runs at a 90Hz refresh rate most of the time, but in an online WWDC session, the company revealed that it is also able to switch to 96Hz to support video content filmed at 24 frames per second.<br/>
<br/>
Code <a href="https://twitter.com/M1Astra/status/1709429656829534557">found by M1 Astra</a> confirms that the actual maximum Vision Pro refresh rate is 100Hz, but 100Hz is a mode that only activates to "compensate for detected 50Hz flicker from artificial lighting."<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Apple Vision Pro refresh rate revealed according to visionOS beta 4. There seems to be refresh rate modes, 100Hz, 96Hz, and 90Hz. &quot;Adjusted to 100Hz to compensate for detected 50Hz flicker from artifical lighting.&quot; &quot;Travel mode requires 90Hz at all times.&quot; <br>More in the images. <a href="https://t.co/KatDpjxIha">pic.twitter.com/KatDpjxIha</a></p>&mdash; M1 (@M1Astra) <a href="https://twitter.com/M1Astra/status/1709429656829534557?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 4, 2023</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div><br/>
The headset will be able to switch between the 90Hz, 96Hz, and 100Hz modes, but for the most part, it will work at 90Hz. In "Travel Mode," which is a mode that can be set when the headset is used on the go such as on a flight, 90Hz is the maximum.<br/>
<br/>
The two displays in the Vision Pro headset are custom micro-OLED screens with a total of 23 million pixels, more pixels than a 4K TV for each eye.

		<description><![CDATA[Device insurance provider Allstate Protection Plans today shared the results of one of its annual device drop tests, and this time around, the company broke some of the most expensive smartphones on the market, including the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a> Max.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe title="Allstate Protection Plans Our Most Expensive Breakability Test Ever" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fbdVZbV2VpU" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div><br/>
The drop and dunk tests included the &#36;1,200 &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; Max, the &#36;1,200 Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra, the &#36;1,799 Samsung Galaxy Z Fold5, and the &#36;1,799 Google Pixel Fold. These are the most expensive smartphone options from Apple, Google, and Samsung, and all of these phones are constructed from glass.<br/>
<br/>
For these tests, Allstate dunked each smartphone in water for 30 minutes and then dropped them onto a sidewalk from six feet up using an apparatus to drop them from the same height and angle.<br/>
<br/>
As all of these smartphones have decent water resistance ratings, they were working fine following the dunk test, but glass and concrete sidewalks don't mix well, so no smartphone fared well on the drop test.<br/>
<br/>
In the front screen-down drop test, the &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; Max shattered on the first drop and was unusable with shards of raised and loose glass. The same thing happened to the Galaxy S23.<br/>
<br/>
The Z Fold5 and the Google Pixel Fold were able to withstand two screen-down drops with frame damage, screen dents, and scuffing, which Allstate attributes to the raised lip around the interior edge of each display. Screen down in this case refers to the "main" screen visible when the device is opened. When the two smartphones were dropped on their closed outer displays, they both shattered.<br/>
<br/>
In back-down drop tests, the &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; Max and Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra both shattered immediately. The &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; Max remained functional, but two of the cameras were no longer working because of damage to the camera glass.<br/>
<br/>
Allstate Protection Plans has been doing these tests for years now on each <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> generation, and there hasn't been a lot of improvement despite Apple's glass upgrades. Apple is using a stronger back glass and a "Ceramic Shield" material for the front, but glass is glass and it continues to break.<br/>
<br/>
Drop tests are variable and the results depend on the angle the smartphone happens to fall at, the material it hits, the speed of the drop, and more. While Allstate Protection Plans uses the same variables for its tests, there's always an element of unpredictability and these experiments don't reflect real-world results.<br/>
<br/>
It should come as no surprise that it's best not to drop a smartphone made of glass onto concrete. Apple sells a range of &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; cases for customers to choose from, plus it offers <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/applecare/">AppleCare</a>+, covering two incidents of accidental damage each year for a &#36;29 deductible. &zwnj;AppleCare&zwnj;+ is a good idea if you plan to go caseless.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/09/iphone-15-breakability-test/">Breakability Test Pits iPhone 15 Pro Max Against Galaxy Z Fold5, Pixel Fold and More</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/breakability-test-pits-iphone-15-pro-max-against-galaxy-z-fold5-pixel-fold-and-more.2406961/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Samsung today joined Google in attempting to convince Apple to adopt the Rich Communication Services or RCS messaging standard that Google has been pushing.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe title="Green bubbles and blue bubbles want to be together. Help Apple #GetTheMessage." src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Rvr6XSFKJA8" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div><br/>
In a short ad that's a riff on Romeo and Juliet, Samsung features two smartphone interfaces texting each other. "Juliet" is the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> in the metaphor and her parents (aka Apple) won't allow for the adoption of RCS. "What did green ever do to them? We're bubbles too," laments the "Romeo" Android smartphone. "And literally everyone wants us to be together. Ugh," writes Juliet.<br/>
<br/>
It's ultimately a bit of a confusing ad, but Samsung makes it clear with the title of the video: "Green bubbles and blue bubbles want to be together." Samsung also includes the "Help Apple #GetTheMessage" tagline and hashtag that Google has been using for its RCS campaign.<br/>
<br/>
Google has been hounding Apple about adopting RCS for several years now using ads, billboards, websites, social media campaigns, and more, but Apple has refused.<br/>
<br/>
RCS, or Rich Communication Services, is a communication protocol designed by and adopted by Google. Google has been pushing Apple to implement support for RCS, but Apple devices continue to support the older SMS protocol. Google claims that Apple is responsible for all the issues that Android and &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; users have texting one another, including lack of encryption, broken group chats, pixelated pictures and videos, and the green bubbles.<br/>
<br/>
Apple CEO <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tim-cook/">Tim Cook</a> <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/09/08/tim-cook-on-ios-rcs-buy-your-mom-an-iphone/">in September 2022</a> said that RCS is not a priority for Apple and that it is not a feature that &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; users are asking for.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/samsung/">Samsung</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/google/">Google</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/rcs/">RCS</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/09/samsung-pushes-apple-to-adopt-rcs/">&#039;Green Bubbles and Blue Bubbles Want to Be Together&#039; Says Samsung Ad Pushing Apple to Adopt RCS</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/green-bubbles-and-blue-bubbles-want-to-be-together-says-samsung-ad-pushing-apple-to-adopt-rcs.2406956/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple is considering bringing OLED displays to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-mini/">iPad mini</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/">iPad Air</a> from 2026, according to a <a href="https://omdia.tech.informa.com/blogs/2023/apple-ipad-panel-purchasing-plan-and-forecast">report</a> from technology research firm Omdia. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/06/OLED-iPad-Air.jpg" alt="" width="2363" height="1329" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-806474" /><br/>
In a detailed report forecasting Apple's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> panel purchasing plans published earlier today, Omdia explains that 2024 will mark the beginning of a transition to OLED in its tablet lineup. The potential transition to OLED on Apple's two mid-range tablets is apparently part of its OLED strategy from 2026 onwards.<br/>
<br/>
Apple has ostensibly not yet committed to bringing the more advanced display technology to its mid-range tablets, and may be planning to review how the market responds to the first <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a> models that feature OLED displays, which are expected to launch next year, before locking in new display panels for the &zwnj;iPad mini&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
The report also corroborates details about the rumored <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/oled-ipad-pro/">iPad Pro models with OLED displays</a> that are widely expected to launch next year, with the panels due to be supplied by LG and Samsung. Apple is said to currently be seeking more suppliers for OLED displays designed for the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
The next-generation &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; is expected to launch in 2024 and be the first major update to the product since 2018, introducing "<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/27/new-ipad-pro-and-redesigned-magic-keyboard/">fundamental changes</a>" that include larger OLED displays, the M3 chip, and support for a completely <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/27/new-ipad-pro-and-redesigned-magic-keyboard/">redesigned Magic Keyboard</a> accessory.<br/>
<br/>
Omdia added that after the 11th-generation &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; launches, Apple may "gradually migrate from 10.2-inch iPads to 10.9-inch iPads," suggesting that the ninth-generation model will be discontinued.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/">iPad Air </a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-mini/">iPad mini</a></div><div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/oled/">OLED</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/oled-ipad-pro/">OLED iPad Pro</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/omdia/">Omdia</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPad-Air">iPad Air (Don't Buy)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#11-iPad-Pro">11" iPad Pro (Caution)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#12-9-iPad-Pro">12.9" iPad Pro (Caution)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPad_Mini">iPad Mini (Caution)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipad.137">iPad</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/09/oled-ipad-mini-and-ipad-air-2026/">OLED iPad Mini and iPad Air Could Follow 2024&#039;s iPad Pro</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/oled-ipad-mini-and-ipad-air-could-follow-2024s-ipad-pro.2406938/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple CEO <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tim-cook/">Tim Cook</a> has explained why the company releases a new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> every year, what the device will be like in the future, what he is personally doing to reduce his carbon footprint, and more in a new <a href="https://brut.media/in/science-and-technology/tim-cook-speaks-to-brut-bc5fd23c-d951-4a9c-850f-55951d24f303">interview with <em>Brut.</em></a><br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/08/tim-cook-2022-iphone-14.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="448" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-906012" /><br/>
The brief interview, shot at an Apple data center and solar power facility in Denmark, delves mainly into Cook's opinion on various environmental issues such as "greenwashing." Cook explained that Apple wants to contrast its secrecy about its products with openness about its environmental efforts because it wants to be copied by others. Cook added that Apple still has more work to do in terms of renewable power and use of recycled materials to reach its environmental goals.<br/>
<br/>
When asked if "we really need a new &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; every year," Cook answered:<blockquote>I think having an iPhone every year for those people that want it is a great thing. And what we do is we allow people to trade in their phone. And so we then resell that phone if it's still working. And if it's not working, we've got ways of disassembling it and taking the materials to make a new iPhone out of.</blockquote><br/>
<br/>
The interviewer then asked what the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; will be like 20 or 30 years into the future:<blockquote>I think it'll be carbon neutral. I think obviously it will be way ahead of where it currently is, but I wouldn't want to give you all of our secrets in that regard. I'll just say from an environmental point of view, it'll be carbon neutral.</blockquote><br/>
<br/>
When asked what Cook does personally to help the environment, he responded:<blockquote>I do drive an electric car. I try to avoid plastics and plastic bottles. I recycle. I compost. All of these things I try to do, everything I do, I try my best to do something that has a lower carbon footprint.</blockquote><br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Early work on Apple's second-generation Vision Pro headset focuses on reducing the device's size and weight, as well as an improved experience for users who need prescription lenses, according to <em>Bloomberg</em>'s <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/Apple-Vision-Pro-with-battery-Feature-Orange.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-898552" /><br/>
In the <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2023-10-08/apple-plans-smaller-lighter-vision-headset-meta-works-on-cheaper-quest-3-ar-lnhh1ulx">latest edition</a> of his "Power On" newsletter, Gurman explained that Apple's Vision Products Group has moved onto next-generation headset models and is considering several options, including lower-end and more powerful versions. The work, which remains early, seeks to make the device lighter and slightly smaller to address complaints that the first-generation Vision Pro feels too heavy on the head.<br/>
<br/>
Apple is also apparently exploring how to make a headset purchase simpler for those who wear glasses. The first-generation Vision Pro requires wearers of glasses to separately purchase Zeiss prescription lenses that snap on to the displays using magnets. The company reportedly made this decision to reduce the overall thickness of the headset, but the need to stock thousands of different lens combinations is reportedly proving difficult.<br/>
<br/>
With the second-generation, Apple is considering shipping custom-built Vision Pro headsets with preinstalled prescription lenses directly from the factory. Gurman notes that this invokes a different set of problems with sharing a headset, reselling it, and when a user's optical prescription changes over time.<br/>
<br/>
According to other reports, the second-generation Vision Pro headset is not expected to launch until around <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/16/apple-second-gen-headset-low-high-end/">2025</a> to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/26/low-cost-vision-pro-canceled/">2027</a>.

		<description><![CDATA[Apple often releases new Macs in the fall, but whether that will happen this year is far from certain. It's the second week of October now, and if Apple plans to launch Macs before the holidays, recent history suggests it will happen this month. Here's what we know so far.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/02/spring-2022-possible-macs.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-837944" /><br/>
It's been over 120 days since Apple released a new Mac, the last being <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m2/">M2</a> versions of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-pro/">Mac Pro</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-studio/">Mac Studio</a>, and 15-inch <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/">MacBook Air</a>, all of which arrived in June. Prior to that, in January, Apple released &zwnj;M2&zwnj; Pro and &zwnj;M2&zwnj; Max versions of the 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro, alongside new M2-powered <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-mini/">Mac mini</a> models.<br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile, the 13-inch &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; and 13-inch MacBook Pro  haven't been updated in over 450 days, and the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/">iMac</a> hasn't seen an update in over 880 days (Apple unveiled the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m1/">M1</a> 24-inch &zwnj;iMac&zwnj; way back in April 2021). It's these last three models that are most due updates, but that's not to say Apple will prioritize them for updates over other Macs.<br/>
<br/>
If you look at the last decade, Apple often holds an annual fall event in which it launches new Macs and iPads. While Apple that didn't happen last year, there were October events in 2013, 2014, 2016, 2018, 2020, and 2021. <br/>
<br/>
<em>Bloomberg</em>'s <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a> recently told <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/the-macrumors-show/">The MacRumors Show</a> that he <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/09/gurman-october-apple-event-unlikely/">does not</a> expect Apple to hold an October event because the company does not have enough new products and features to justify it. <br/>
<br/>
However, that doesn't mean we won't be seeing any more new Macs from Apple this year. Apple could choose to release new models via press release instead, like it did in January 2023 for the 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models. At the same time, Apple may not have any new models forthcoming this side of Christmas 2023. So what do the rumors say?<br/>
<br/>
<h3>Mac Pro, Mac Studio, MacBook Air</h3><br/>
It's worth repeating that Apple this year has already updated the &zwnj;Mac Pro&zwnj;, &zwnj;Mac Studio&zwnj;, and 15-inch &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj;. These updates were released in June 2023, so there is little chance that they will be superseded by newer models before 2024.<br/>
<br/>
However, Apple has not yet updated the smaller 13-inch &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; this year. This model was originally announced in June 2022, so there is scope for a refresh soon. According to <em>Bloomberg</em>'s &zwnj;Mark Gurman&zwnj;, the 13-inch &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; could be one of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/07/17/apple-m3-macs-october-event/">first beneficiaries of Apple's new M3 chip</a>, but it is unclear if this upgrade will arrive in late 2023 or early 2024.<br/>
<br/>
<h3>Mac Mini, 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro</h3><br/>
Apple updated the 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro with &zwnj;M2&zwnj; Pro and &zwnj;M2&zwnj; Max chips in January, and most rumors suggest refreshed models are coming next year. According to Gurman, the next version of these two machines are expected to feature M3 Pro and M3 Max chips and will "<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/07/23/new-macbook-pro-and-mac-mini-with-m3-2024-launch/">probably</a>" launch by the middle of 2024 at the latest.<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/05/new-14-16-inch-macbook-pro-models-2023/">supply chain report in October</a> claimed that Apple is preparing to release new 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models with more power-efficient mini-LED displays before the year is out.<br/>
<br/>
As for the &zwnj;Mac mini&zwnj;, Apple updated the machine with &zwnj;M2&zwnj; chips in January 2023, while M3-powered models are not expected to emerge until late 2024 at the earliest, according to Gurman.<br/>
<br/>
<h3>iMac, 13-inch MacBook Pro</h3><br/>
That leaves the &zwnj;iMac&zwnj; and 13-inch MacBook Pro. Apple's 24-inch &zwnj;iMac&zwnj; was refreshed with a new design, &zwnj;M1&zwnj; chips, and new color options in April 2021. While the ‌&zwnj;iMac&zwnj;‌ did not receive an upgrade to the &zwnj;M2&zwnj; chip this year, a refreshed model with the M3 chip is expected to launch soon, potentially towards the end of this year.<br/>
<br/>
The 13-inch MacBook Pro was updated with the &zwnj;M2&zwnj; chip in June 2022, so this is another model that could see an upgrade soon, possibly later this year. <br/>
<br/>
With that said, supply chain analyst <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/">Ming-Chi Kuo</a> in September <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/08/kuo-first-m3-macbooks-unlikely-2023/">claimed</a> that Apple is unlikely to release any new MacBook models with the M3 chip this year. However, Kuo only ruled out new MacBooks, so there is still potential for a new &zwnj;iMac&zwnj; this year.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Summing Up</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/New-Macs-2023.jpg" alt="" width="1960" height="1102" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-900100" /><br/>
As things stand, we could still see at least one Mac with a new M3 chip before the end of the year. The as-yet-unannounced M3 chip is widely expected to be fabricated with TSMC's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/3nm/">3nm</a> process for significant performance and power efficiency improvements compared to the current 5nm-based &zwnj;M2&zwnj; chip, which debuted in June 2022.<br/>
<br/>
Given that Apple launched new 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models in January, and more recently new 15-inch &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj;, &zwnj;Mac Studio&zwnj;, and &zwnj;Mac Pro&zwnj; models in June, Gurman believes the first beneficiaries of the new M3 chip will be the next &zwnj;iMac&zwnj;, 13-inch &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj;, and 13-inch MacBook Pro.<br/>
<br/>
Gurman has said that if these products do come out in 2023, Apple is likely to unveil them via press release rather than with an event.<br/>
<br/>
Lastly, <em>MacRumors</em> received information in early October indicating that Apple was preparing to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/03/trade-in-changes-may-indicate-new-mac-this-month/">accept some of its latest Mac models for trade-in</a>, suggesting it may be proceeding with plans to release new Mac models. Whether this correlates with the launch of at least one new machine around mid-October however remains to be seen.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/09/will-apple-release-new-macs-this-year/">Will Apple Release New Macs Soon?

		<description><![CDATA[<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/touchscreen-mac/">Touchscreen Mac</a> rumors are not new, but it turns out that neither are touchscreen Macs. In 1999, a company called Elo produced and sold touchscreen versions of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/">iMac</a> G3 through Apple's Value Added Reseller program for use as kiosk machines, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZGswRH4wbM">YouTuber Michael MJD</a> recently managed to get hold of one. <br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oZGswRH4wbM?si=uuHYHNbawfNWWSJ8" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><br/>
The "ready-to-go tabletop kiosks" featured Elo's own iTouch touch-on-tube interface, which used surface acoustic waves instead of an overlay to detect where users touched the screen. You can see a prototype Elo &zwnj;iMac&zwnj; in action in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZGswRH4wbM">Michael MJD's video</a>, which also covers the history of the machine as well as its technical specifications. Given the simplicity of the hardware modification, it's a pretty impressive feat.<br/>
<br/>
Rumors of Apple developing its own touchscreen &zwnj;iMac&zwnj; date back to 2010, initially fueled by Apple patents for a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2010/08/23/apple-discloses-methods-for-transitioning-between-mouse-based-and-touch-interfaces/">touchscreen desktop computer</a> and then reports of touch panels making their way through Apple's supply chain. <br/>
<br/>
Former Apple CEO Steve Jobs appeared to put the kibosh on those rumors in 2010 when he said that "touch surfaces don't want to be vertical" due to arm fatigue associated with holding up a finger to the screen. <br/>
<br/>
In the years that followed, Apple firmly established <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> at its touchscreen products, with no change in its position on touchscreen for Macs. As recently as 2021, Apple's hardware engineering chief John Ternus said the Mac was "totally optimized for indirect input" and said the company did not feel there was a good reason to change that.<br/>
<br/>
Despite the years of resistance, however, Apple has reportedly started working on adding touchscreens to Macs. According to <em>Bloomberg</em>'s <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a>, a new MacBook Pro with an OLED display could be the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/01/11/touchscreen-macs-report/">first touchscreen Mac in 2025</a>.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/09/video-of-prototype-touchscreen-imac-g3/">Video Shows Off Prototype Touchscreen iMac...

		<description><![CDATA[After a few weeks of controversy over potential overheating in the new iPhone 15 Pro models, Apple this week released a software update to help address the issue, which the company says is not the result of the new titanium casing or other thermal design problems.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/top-stories-7oct2023.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-915933" /><br/>
Apple is also continuing work on the next round of more significant software updates led by iOS 17.1, and we're keeping tabs on everything that's new. Notably, the latest watchOS 10.1 beta enables the Double Tap feature that was one of the main promotional selling points of the latest Apple Watch Series 9 and Apple Watch Ultra 2 models, so read on for all the details on these stories and more! <br/>
<br/>
<h2>Apple Releases iOS 17.0.3 With Fix for iPhone 15 Pro Overheating</h2><br/>
Apple this week <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/04/apple-releases-ios-17-0-3/">released iOS 17.0.3 with a fix</a> for an issue that may cause the iPhone 15 Pro models to run warmer than expected. The software update also includes several <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/04/ios-17-0-3-enterprise-bug-fixes/">enterprise-related bug fixes</a> and important security updates, according to Apple.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/iOS-17.0.3-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-915213" /><br/>
Apple said the iPhone 15 Pro's titanium frame was <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/30/apple-iphone-15-pro-overheating-details/">not a contributing factor to the overheating</a>, and it said the software update does not lower the A17 Pro chip's performance to address the issue.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>iOS 17.1 Beta: All the New Features So Far</h2><br/>
Apple this week made the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/04/ios-17-1-public-beta-2/">second beta of iOS 17.1</a> available to developers and public beta testers, and there are some new features as usual.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/iOS-17.1-On-iPhone-15-Feature-2.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-915210" /><br/>
We've put together a list of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ios-17-1-beta-features/">all of the new features and changes introduced in the iOS 17.1 betas so far</a>. The software update is expected to be released later this month for the iPhone XS and newer, so there are likely still a few more beta versions to come.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Warning: BMW Wireless Charging May Break iPhone 15's Apple Pay Chip</h2><br/>
If you have an iPhone 15 and drive a BMW, it might be best to avoid charging the device with the vehicle's wireless charging pad for now.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/BMW-Logo-iPhone-15-Pro.jpg" alt="" width="1489" height="744" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-914891" /><br/>
Over the past few weeks, some BMW owners have complained that their <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/01/bmw-charging-may-break-iphone-15-nfc-chip/">iPhone 15's NFC chip no longer works after charging the device</a> with their vehicle's wireless charging pad. It's unclear if the issue has been resolved with iOS 17.0.3 or the iOS 17.1 beta.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>watchOS 10.1 Beta 2 Adds Support for Double Tap</h2><br/>
The new Double Tap gesture for the Apple Watch Series 9 and Apple Watch Ultra 2 is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/03/watchos-10-1-double-tap-support/">functional starting with the second beta of watchOS 10.1</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/apple-watch-ultra-double-tap-feature-green.jpg" alt="" width="2210" height="1243" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-915455" /><br/>
Double Tap lets you <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/04/new-apple-watch-double-tap-gesture/">tap your index finger and thumb together twice</a> to perform common actions on the Apple Watch, such as stopping a timer, playing and pausing music, snoozing an alarm, answering and ending a phone call, and more, all without touching the screen.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Original Apple Watch is Now Obsolete, Including &#36;17,000 Gold Model</h2><br/>
All first-generation Apple Watch models released in 2015 have now been declared obsolete by Apple, meaning they are no longer eligible for repairs or other service at Apple Stores and Apple Authorized Service Provider locations.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/Apple-Watch-Edition-Gold-2015-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2117" height="1191" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-915086" /><br/>
This includes the original 18-karat gold Apple Watch Edition model which sold for up to &#36;17,000 at launch. The solid-gold Apple Watch option was discontinued in 2016 and replaced with more reasonably priced but still premium-priced Apple Watch Edition models made with cermamic or titanium for future years.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>How to Get the Most Out of the iPhone 15 Pro's Action Button</h2><br/>
On our YouTube channel, we recently shared a video highlighting some <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/03/iphone-15-pro-action-button-tools/">useful ways to take advantage of the customizable Action button</a> on the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/Best-Shortcuts-You-Need-to-Try-Thumb-2.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-915252" /><br/>
For example, Federico Viticci of <em>MacStories</em> came up with a way for two separate shortcuts to be assigned to the Action button. He calls this solution MultiButton, and we provide a closer look at it in our video.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[With every new operating system release and new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>, there are complaints about issues with battery life, and this year is no exception. There are often periods of rapid battery drain following an update or release due to behind-the-scenes syncing, but sometimes problems can persist longer.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/iphone-15-blue-23.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-911509" /><br/>
Battery life problems can be caused by new features Apple has implemented, bugs that need to be fixed, or simply an uptick in usage after an update. Whatever the cause, we've rounded up some suggestions on how you can maximize your &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;'s battery life in situations where every last minute is important.<br/>
<br/>
Note that there aren't many suggestions that don't disable key features on the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;, so you need to balance battery drain with the feature set that you want enabled, turning things off and on as needed when better battery life is required. Not all of these tips are specific to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a> and the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a> models, but these steps will absolutely help preserve battery on your new device.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="1._turn_off_live_activities">1. Turn Off Live Activities</h2><br/>
Live Activities let apps keep an ongoing notification on the Lock Screen or <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/dynamic-island/">Dynamic Island</a>, and in &zwnj;iOS 17&zwnj;, Live Activities are used more than ever before. Combined with the Always-On display of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-14/">iPhone 14</a> Pro and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a> models, Live Activities can noticeably drain the battery.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-849710" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/06/ios-16-live-activities-feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" /><br/>
Live Activities can be disabled by following these steps:<br/>
<ol><br/>
 <li>Open up the Settings app.</li><br/>
 <li>Go to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mask-face-id/">Face ID</a> & Passcode.</li><br/>
 <li>Enter your passcode to unlock the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;.</li><br/>
 <li>Scroll down and toggle off Live Activities.</li><br/>
</ol><br/>
This will prevent Live Activities from showing up on the Lock Screen, but you'll want to take this one step further. In the individual app sections in the Settings app, you can disable Live Activities on an app-by-app basis, or avoid using Live Activities features within apps.<br/>
<br/>
You can't fully disable the &zwnj;Dynamic Island&zwnj;, but you can swipe left on any running animation to dismiss it.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="2._delete_lock_screen_and_home_screen_widgets">2. Delete Lock Screen and Home Screen Widgets</h2><br/>
In &zwnj;iOS 17&zwnj;, Apple further improved widgets, introducing interactivity. <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/home-screen/">Widgets</a> can now be used right on the Lock Screen, so you can do things like control smart home products or check off Reminders without opening an app.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/04/iOS-17-Widgets.jpeg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-892127" /><br/>
If you're not using a particular widget often, it might be best to remove it to preserve battery life, though it is worth exploring whether using a widget is less battery intensive than opening up an app.<br/>
<br/>
On the Lock Screen specifically, you can use an option that doesn't have widgets, which makes it easy to switch over. Specific Lock Screens can be linked to a Focus mode, so you can even set up something that removes widgets and nixes unimportant notifications.<br/>
<br/>
For details on adding widgets, removing widgets, and creating Lock Screens, we have a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ios-16-lock-screen/">dedicated Lock Screen guide</a> and a guide on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ios-17-lock-screen/">interactive widgets</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="_turn_off_live_voicemail"> Turn Off Live Voicemail</h2><br/>
Live Voicemail is a feature that lets you get a real-time readout of a voicemail that someone is leaving so you can answer the phone if it's something important. Since Live Voicemail shows up right on the Lock Screen, it's not doing your battery any favors.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/Live-Voicemail-iOS-17.jpg" alt="" width="1306" height="793" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-898863" /><br/>
If you want to disable it, you can do so by going to Settings > Phone > Live Voicemail and toggling it off.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="4._turn_off_proximity_airdrop_sharing">4. Turn Off Proximity AirDrop Sharing</h2><br/>
When you hold two iPhones running &zwnj;iOS 17&zwnj; together, or an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; running &zwnj;iOS 17&zwnj; and an Apple Watch running watchOS 10.1, the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; initiates a proximity-based AirDrop or contact transfer protocol. If you're continually triggering this, it can drain battery, so if you've got your &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; near another &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; and the AirDrop interface keeps popping up, you might want to turn it off.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/08/airdrop-proximity-sharing.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1327" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-905665" /><br/>
To do so, go to Settings > General > AirDrop and toggle off "Bringing Devices Together."<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="5._take_advantage_of_offline_maps">5. Take Advantage of Offline Maps</h2><br/>
In &zwnj;iOS 17&zwnj;, you can download <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-maps/">Apple Maps</a> for offline usage. It's useful for when you don't have a cellular connection, but it's also good to use even if you do. If you're traveling in an area where you have a somewhat spotty connection, downloading a map for that spot and then turning off cellular will preserve your battery life without impacting your ability to get around.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/Apple-Maps-Offline.jpeg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-899235" /><br/>
We have a dedicated how-to that <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/download-offline-maps-ios-apple-maps/">walks you through downloading a map for offline usage</a>, but it's as simple as searching for a location in Maps, tapping the download button, and then selecting the area of the map to download.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="6._disable_haptic_keyboard_feedback">6. Disable Haptic Keyboard Feedback</h2><br/>
Apple has a keyboard option that gives you haptic feedback when you tap the on-screen keys. It vibrates with each key tap for a more satisfying typing experience, but what you might not know is that it drains battery.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-872406" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/11/haptic-keyboard-feedback.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1961" /><br/>
Apple said <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/09/20/ios-16-haptic-keyboard-battery-life/">in a support document</a> last year that keyboard haptics might affect battery life, so it's not something you want to use when you don't have battery to spare. It's not on by default, but if you've enabled it, you can turn it off by following these steps:<br/>
<ol><br/>
 <li>Open up the Settings app.</li><br/>
 <li>Tap on Sounds & Haptics.</li><br/>
 <li>Tap on Keyboard Feedback.</li><br/>
 <li>Toggle off Haptic.</li><br/>
</ol><br/>
<h2 id="7._turn_off_always-on_display_iphone_15_pro">7. Turn Off Always-On Display (iPhone 15 Pro)</h2><br/>
As the name suggests, the Always-On display on the &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; models leaves the time, your wallpaper, widgets, and Live Activities visible on the Lock Screen even when your &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; is locked.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-864733" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/09/turn-off-always-on-display.jpg" alt="settings" width="640" height="408" /><br/>
The display is using a 1Hz refresh rate to preserve battery, and Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/09/15/apple-details-iphone-14-pro-always-on-display/">has neat tricks</a> like turning off the display when a connected Apple Watch is no longer nearby (signaling that the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; owner is out of the room) or the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; is in a pocket, but Always-On display still drains battery faster than no Always-On display.<br/>
<br/>
You can turn off the Always-On display by following these steps:<br/>
<ol><br/>
 <li>Open up the Settings app.</li><br/>
 <li>Tap on Display & Brightness.</li><br/>
 <li>Tap on Always On Display.</li><br/>
 <li>Toggle off Always On Display.</li><br/>
</ol><br/>
It's not really clear just how much battery life the Always-On display drains because it's going to vary from use case to use case, but even if it's only a few percent, it's worth turning off, especially if it's not a feature that you find useful.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="8._choose_non-animated_wallpapers">8. Choose Non-Animated Wallpapers</h2><br/>
Some of the fancy wallpapers that are available for the Lock Screen are animated, and an animated wallpaper will drain just a bit more battery than a static wallpaper. If you're optimizing and don't care much for the animations, choose something that's not going to update throughout the day.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-860266" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/08/ios-16-weather-lock-screen.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1961" /><br/>
The Weather wallpaper, for example, changes based on the conditions, and the Photo Shuffle option swaps through your selected photos during the day. The Astronomy wallpaper also changes based on current conditions.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="9._use_focus_modes">9. Use Focus Modes</h2><br/>
Using Apple's built-in Focus option can cut down on the number of notifications that you're receiving during the day, and fewer notifications means less opportunity for apps to wake up your display and cause battery drain.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/06/ios-16-lock-screen-focus.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1250" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-850799" /><br/>
Focus modes let you choose which apps and people can send you notifications and when, so during work hours you can make sure you're only getting work notifications, and during personal time, you can limit your work notifications. You can limit notifications when driving, when you're asleep, when you're working out, and in any other scenario you can think of. Focus filters even let you filter out select emails, messages, calendars, and more.<br/>
<br/>
You'll still get all of your notifications when the Focus mode ends, but all in one alert rather than multiple. Turning off unwanted notifications from apps is still the best method for saving battery life, but Focus lets you keep your notifications while still cutting down on the number that you receive at any given time.<br/>
<br/>
Apple made Focus modes are relatively easy to set up, but it still takes some work to get everything running, so <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ios-16-focus/">we have a dedicated Focus guide</a>. You can find all of the Focus features in the Focus section of the Settings app.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="10._use_scheduled_summary">10. Use Scheduled Summary</h2><br/>
It's also worth making sure that any app that sends non-important notifications is relegated to the Scheduled Summary, which saves up notifications and sends them to you once or twice a day.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-823339" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/10/ios-15-2-notification-summary.jpg" alt="" width="773" height="768" /><br/>
You can toggle on Scheduled Summary for apps in the Notifications section of the Settings app, where you can specify which apps should have their notifications include in Scheduled Summary and when you want them delivered.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="11._limit_when_and_how_often_apps_can_access_location">11. Limit When and How Often Apps Can Access Location</h2><br/>
It's always good to check in on privacy and access settings to make sure apps and services aren't doing things you don't want them to be doing.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-872415" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/11/ios-16-location-services.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1299" /><br/>
Limiting the apps that have access to your location and how often apps can access that data can save battery life.<br/>
<ol><br/>
 <li>Open up the Settings app.</li><br/>
 <li>Choose Privacy & Security.</li><br/>
 <li>Tap Location Services.</li><br/>
 <li>Review the list and edit settings by tapping on the name of each app in the list.</li><br/>
</ol><br/>
You have four possible choices for location settings for each app, though not all four choices will always be available for every app depending on what it does. You can select the following: Never, Ask Next Time Or When I Share, While Using the App, and Always.<br/>
<br/>
Never will prevent an app from ever accessing your location, and unless there's a specific need for an app to know where you are, such as a mapping app, setting location access to Never is the best choice.<br/>
<br/>
Ask Next Time Or When I Share will prompt an app to ask you with a pop-up the next time that it wants your location, so you can temporarily approve it. With this setting, location access is off until expressly allowed via the pop-up.<br/>
<br/>
While Using the App allows the app to detect your location only when the app is open and being actively used. If you close the app or switch over to another app, location access ends.<br/>
<br/>
Always allows an app to have access to your location at all times, regardless of whether it's open or closed. This will result in the most battery drain and should be limited to only the apps that you need the most.<br/>
<br/>
A <em>lot</em> of apps will ask for location information that don't really need it to function (for example, a banking app might want location access to show nearby ATMs, which is also available through entering a zip code), so clearing the cruft will ensure no apps are accessing your location without express permission.<br/>
<br/>
You can also turn off Location Services all together, but it's not ideal because it can impact crucial apps like Maps.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="12._limit_apps_using_bluetooth">12. Limit Apps Using Bluetooth</h2><br/>
Your &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; lets you know when apps have requested Bluetooth access, and there are quite a few apps that want Bluetooth access for location tracking, scanning for Chromecast devices, or other not-so-useful reasons.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-872416" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/11/app-bluetooth-permissions.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1961" /><br/>
Checking on the apps using Bluetooth is worthwhile to make sure that you don't have a sneaky app connecting to Bluetooth sources without your permission and draining battery. To get to Bluetooth settings:<br/>
<ol><br/>
 <li>Open the Settings app.</li><br/>
 <li>Tap on Privacy & Security.</li><br/>
 <li>Tap Bluetooth.</li><br/>
</ol><br/>
Apps like Facebook, MAX, Hulu, and others don't need Bluetooth access for the most part, so toggle off any app that doesn't need a Bluetooth connection to function. If a feature in an app stops working, you can just turn it right back on.<br/>
<br/>
Disabling Bluetooth entirely is also an option, but it's used for AirPods, Apple Watches, and other accessories, so turning it off isn't feasible for most people.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="13._use_low_power_mode">13. Use Low Power Mode</h2><br/>
Using Low Power Mode liberally is an obvious choice for maintaining battery without having to hassle with a lot of settings, and you can toggle it on from Control Center, the Battery section of the Settings app, or using <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a>. <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT205234">Low Power Mode</a> cuts down on background activity, turns off your display after inactivity more quickly, limits display refresh rate, limits email fetch, cuts down on visual effects, and more.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-858449" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/08/ios-16-beta-6-battery-percent-low-power.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" /><br/>
Low Power Mode can be set to turn on at a certain battery percentage using Shortcuts, which is a handy way to have it automatically turn on when you need it.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="14._use_wi-fi_and_airplane_mode">14. Use Wi-Fi and Airplane Mode</h2><br/>
When you can, it's best to connect to Wi-Fi to maximize battery life, and it's one of the battery preserving tips that Apple offers. At home or at work, make sure you connect to Wi-Fi rather than using cellular signal. Nothing drains a battery quite like a 5G connection, especially one that's unstable.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-872417" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/11/airplane-mode-ios-16.jpg" alt="" width="1954" height="1099" /><br/>
If you're in an area with no Wi-Fi and you know you have low cellular signal, turn on Airplane Mode or turn off your cellular connection so it's not draining your battery trying to connect. This of course only works when you don't need a cellular connection in the moment, but it can have a big impact and you probably can't do much with low signal anyway.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="15._manage_apps_draining_battery">15. Manage Apps Draining Battery</h2><br/>
Your &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; tells you which apps are eating up the most battery so you can make sure nothing is secretly draining your battery without your knowledge. You can check your battery usage statistics by opening up the Settings app and tapping on the Battery section.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-872418" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/11/ios-16-battery-settings.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1961" /><br/>
Battery usage charts let you see your battery level over the last 24 hours or for the last 10 days, plus you can see which apps have used the most battery life. If there's an app that you don't need that's draining an excessive amount of battery, delete it. If you do need the app, moderate how often you're using it and what permissions it has like location.<br/>
<br/>
Note that with the &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; models, you can preserve your battery health with a new feature that prevents the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; from charging up past 80 percent. This isn't something you're going to want to enable if you're worried about battery life on a long day out, but if you keep it on while you're home, you can have a healthy battery for a longer period of time. Get to this setting by going to Settings > Battery > Battery Health & Charging > Charging Optimization > 80% Limit.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="16._limit_background_activity">16. Limit Background Activity</h2><br/>
Almost all apps use background refresh to update even when they're not open, and limited background activity and background refresh is a longtime favorite option for cutting down on battery usage.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-872419" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/11/ios-16-background-app-refresh.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1961" /><br/>
You can turn off Background App Refresh all together or choose which apps can refresh in the background.<br/>
<ol><br/>
 <li>Open the Settings app.</li><br/>
 <li>Select General.</li><br/>
 <li>Tap on Background App Refresh.</li><br/>
</ol><br/>
From there, you can tap on the Background App Refresh option to turn Background App Refresh off altogether or choose to have it activate only when connected to Wi-Fi, which doesn't drain battery as much as downloading over cellular.<br/>
<br/>
You can also choose to turn Background App Refresh on just for your most used apps by tapping on the toggle next to each app in the list.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="17._turn_down_screen_brightness">17. Turn Down Screen Brightness</h2><br/>
This is a rather obvious suggestion, but the dimmer your display, the less battery you're using. If you're indoors, drop that brightness down as low as you can tolerate, and hold off on using your &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; in the sun until you can find a shady spot if you really want to maximize battery.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/ios-17-display-brightness.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-915944" /><br/>
The easiest way to drop brightness is to swipe down on the right side of the display to access Control Center and lower the brightness slider. It's also a good idea to make sure you have your display set to Auto-Lock after the shortest interval (30 seconds), which you can do by going to Display & Brightness > Auto-Lock.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="18._change_your_mail_settings">18. Change Your Mail Settings</h2><br/>
Along with turning off Background App Refresh, changing when and how often the Mail app checks for new emails can save you some battery.<br/>
<ol><br/>
 <li>Open up the Settings app.</li><br/>
 <li>Tap Mail.</li><br/>
 <li>Tap Accounts.</li><br/>
 <li>Tap "Fetch New Data" at the bottom. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-729024" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/02/mailfetch.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="1557" /></li><br/>
</ol><br/>
You can turn off Push (which lets you know right away when a new email message is available) and adjust Fetch settings on a per account basis for accounts that don't support Push (like Gmail accounts).<br/>
<br/>
Adjusting the Fetch settings to have longer intervals before checking for new messages can help save battery life, as can turning off Fetch all together in favor of manual checks that will download new messages only when the Mail app is opened.<br/>
<br/>
You can choose the following settings: Automatically, Manually, Hourly, Every 30 Minutes, and Every 15 Minutes.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="iphone_15_overheating">iPhone 15 Overheating</h2><br/>
There has been a lot of talk of overheating issues with the &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; models, particularly the &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; models. Apple released iOS 17.0.3 on October 4 to address a bug that could cause the &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; models to run hotter than expected, plus the company said that some apps like Instagram and Uber were causing processor strain that resulted in overheating. Apple has fixed the issue both with the update and by working with app developers to solve any efficiency problems.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/iOS-17.0.3-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-915213" /><br/>
If you're having issues with heat and battery life, make sure your &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/04/apple-releases-ios-17-0-3/">updated to iOS 17.0.3</a> by going to Settings > General > Software Update.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><br/>
There are endless things to do to preserve battery life, and unfortunately, everything you use your phone for is going to drain battery, so it's all about finding what works for you, what you don't need, and where you can compromise to extend battery life.<br/>
