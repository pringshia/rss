		<description><![CDATA[Well-known talk show host Jon Stewart today confirmed that Apple canceled his <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-tv-plus/">Apple TV+</a> series "The Problem with Jon Stewart" over content concerns. In a discussion with <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/video/jon-stewart-on-why-hes-going-back-to-the-daily-show-anchor-desk/">CBS Mornings</a> (via <em><a href="https://variety.com/2024/tv/news/jon-stewart-explains-apple-exit-why-streamer-canceled-the-problem-1235907986/">Variety</a></em>), Stewart said that Apple did not want him to "say things" that might get him into trouble.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/problem-jon-stewart.jpg" alt="" width="3024" height="1700" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-917873" /><br/>
<blockquote>I wanted a place to unload thoughts as we get into this election season. I thought I was going to do it over at -- they call it Apple TV+. It's a television enclave, very small. It's like living in Malibu. But they decided ... they felt that they didn't want me to say things that might get me in trouble.</blockquote><br/>
Stewart's television show <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/20/apple-tv-show-problem-jon-steward-canceled/">was canceled last October</a> ahead of the launch of the third season, and rumors at the time suggested that he had run into "creative differences" with Apple executives. A report from <em>The New York Times</em> claimed that the disagreements were over some planned guests, show topics related to China, and topics related to artificial intelligence.<br/>
<br/>
Stewart did not provide details on the specific things that he and Apple clashed over, but he has now validated the rumors over the reason why his &zwnj;Apple TV+&zwnj; series was canceled. Such a high profile cancelation could impact Apple's ability to get similar hosts for future projects, as there could be worries over Apple's level of control. Stewart's show explored current affairs "problems" and episodes featured everything from news in the national conversation to issues that were part of Stewart's advocacy work.<br/>
<br/>
Apple canceled "The Problem with Jon Stewart" ahead of the 2024 election year. Stewart has decided to make a return to "The Daily Show," where he will appear every Monday night through the election cycle. His first return show airs tonight.<br/>
<br/>
Stewart was the host of "The Daily Show" for more than 15 years, and he stepped down eight years ago to hand the reins over to Trevor Noah. Noah retired last year, and so the series has been looking for a new host.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-tv-shows/">Apple TV Shows</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-tv-plus/">Apple TV Plus</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/12/jon-stewart-confirms-apple-tv-cancelation-reason/">Jon Stewart Confirms Apple Canceled Show: &#039;They Didn&#039;t Want Me to Say Things That Might Get Me in Trouble&#039;</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/jon-stewart-confirms-apple-canceled-show-they-didnt-want-me-to-say-things-that-might-get-me-in-trouble.2419279/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today released a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/visionos/">visionOS</a> 1.0.3 update for the Vision Pro headset, marking the first update that Apple has provided since the device launched. The software comes two weeks after the release of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/31/apple-releases-visionos-1-0-2/">visionOS 1.0.2 update</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/Apple-Vision-Pro-with-battery-Feature-Blue-Magenta.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-898550" /><br/>
The new &zwnj;visionOS&zwnj; update can be installed by opening the settings app and going to the software update section. <br/>
<br/>
With &zwnj;visionOS&zwnj; 1.0.3, Apple added an option to reset the Vision Pro headset if the passcode set on the device has been forgotten. It also includes unspecified bug fixes. Apple's release notes:<blockquote>This update provides important bug fixes and adds an option to reset your device if youâ€™ve forgotten your passcode.</blockquote>The Vision Pro launched without a way to reset the device without first unlocking it with a passcode, so those who did end up forgetting their passcodes had to go to an Apple retail store to reset it. With the update, if a passcode is rejected a certain number of times, users will get an option to erase the Vision Pro.<br/>
<br/>
Note that erasing the Vision Pro does not remove Activation Lock, so a person who stole the headset and used this feature to wipe it would still not be able to log in with their <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-id/">Apple ID</a>.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/12/apple-releases-visionos-1-0-3/">Apple Releases visionOS 1.0.3 With Reset Option for Forgotten Passcode</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-releases-visionos-1-0-3-with-reset-option-for-forgotten-passcode.2419277/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Now that Apple has launched its Vision Pro headset, we can shift our attention towards what is next on the company's agenda for the year.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/New-Macs-iPads-iOS-17-4.jpg" alt="" width="3198" height="1798" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-936049" /><br/>
As usual, March should be a busy time for Apple, as it is expected to release new MacBook Air, iPad Pro, and iPad Air models during the month. In a recent press release, Apple also confirmed that iOS 17.4 will be released in March.<br/>
<br/>
Below, we recap what to expect from Apple next month.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>New Macs and iPads</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/iPad-Air-12.9-Inch-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2192" height="1233" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-917813" /><br/>
Apple will likely launch new MacBook Air, iPad Pro, and iPad Air models "<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/28/gurman-new-ipads-and-macs-in-late-march/">around the end of March</a>," according to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-01-28/apple-eu-changes-sideloading-third-party-app-stores-are-future-of-the-iphone-lrxjzbg6"><em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman</a>.<br/>
<br/>
The 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Air are expected to be updated with the M3 chip simultaneously, with key benefits over the M2 chip including faster performance and hardware-accelerated ray tracing for improved graphics rendering in games.<br/>
<br/>
No major design changes are expected for the MacBook Air this year, but the laptop will likely gain support for Wi-Fi 6E like other Macs.<br/>
<br/>
Apple already updated the 14-inch MacBook Pro, 16-inch MacBook Pro, and 24-inch iMac with the M3 chip in October 2023.<br/>
<br/>
The next iPad Pro models are widely expected to be the first iPads equipped with more vivid OLED displays. Other rumored or likely features for the iPad Pro include the M3 chip, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/18/ipad-pro-magsafe-charging/">MagSafe wireless charging</a>, a redesigned Magic Keyboard with a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/03/gurman-new-ipad-magic-keyboard-to-feature-aluminum/">larger trackpad and an aluminum top casing</a>, and a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/25/ipad-pro-landscape-face-id-camera/">landscape-oriented front camera</a>.<br/>
<br/>
A <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/10/12-9-inch-ipad-air-display-shipments/">larger 12.9-inch iPad Air</a> is expected alongside an updated 10.9-inch model. Other rumored or likely features for the iPad Air include the M2 chip, a redesigned rear camera bump, Wi-Fi 6E support, and Bluetooth 5.3.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>iOS 17.4</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/iOS-17.4-Feature-Blue.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-932462" /><br/>
In its <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2024/01/apple-announces-changes-to-ios-safari-and-the-app-store-in-the-european-union/">press release</a> announcing <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/26/iphone-changes-coming-to-eu-users/">major App Store changes in the EU</a>, Apple confirmed that iOS 17.4 will be released in March:<blockquote>Developers can learn about these changes on the Apple Developer Support page and can begin testing new capabilities today in the iOS 17.4 beta. The new capabilities will become available to users in the 27 EU countries beginning in March 2024.</blockquote>In addition to the changes in the EU, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/04/ios-17-4-new-features-and-changes/">key new features in iOS 17.4</a> include Apple Podcasts transcripts, SharePlay for the HomePod, new emoji, and the ability to use the Apple Cash card on more websites by generating a virtual card number. The update also includes preparations for the launch of next-generation CarPlay later this year.<br/>
<br/>
Other software updates expected to be released in March include iPadOS 17.4, macOS 14.4, watchOS 10.4, tvOS 17.4, and visionOS 1.1. <br/>
<br/>
<h2>New iPhone Color?</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/03/iPhone-14-Yellow-Feature-2.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-887956" /><br/>
Apple often introduces new iPhone colors around March or April, midway through the smartphone's annual release cycle.<br/>
<br/>
<ul><li><strong>March 2023:</strong> Apple made the iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/07/apple-announces-yellow-iphone-14/">available in Yellow</a>.</li><br/>

		<description><![CDATA[After over a year of reports, there are now more than two dozen specific rumors about the features and improvements set to be offered by the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/">iPhone 16 Pro</a> models later this year. <br/>
<br/>

<h3 id="displays">Displays</h3><br/>
Both &zwnj;iPhone 16 Pro&zwnj; models are expected to feature larger displays than their predecessors, pushing the &zwnj;iPhone 16 Pro&zwnj; Max to be the biggest <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> ever offered. There are also reportedly improvements to the underlying OLED technology in store.<br/>

This is the standard glass version of the Studio Display with the tilt adjustable stand. You can find every Studio Display model for <a href="https://howl.me/clCr6sJ5Q77">&#36;300 off right now on Best Buy</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/03/apple-studio-display-blue.jpg" alt="" width="2250" height="1266" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-839183" /><em><small>Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with Best Buy. When you click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment, which helps us keep the site running.</small></em><br/>
<br/>
The Studio Display features a 27-inch 5K retina display with a 5120 x 2880 resolution and up to 600 nits of brightness. Discounts on the Studio Display have been very rare over the past few months, and this is the first time in 2024 that we've tracked a record low price on any version of the monitor.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://howl.me/clCrLDMWE6w"target="_blank"><div class="fancybutton"><div class="fancybadge">&#36;300 OFF</div>Standard Glass Apple Studio Display for &#36;1,299.99</div></a></div><br/>
<br/>
If you want to upgrade to the nano-texture glass option, Best Buy also has this model of the Studio Display on sale. It's available for <a href="https://howl.me/clCrNWURo0s"><strong>&#36;1,599.99</strong></a>, down from &#36;1,899.99, which is a second-best price on the Studio Display with nano-texture glass.<br/>
<br/>
Apple says that the standard display is engineered for "extremely low reflectivity," but for rooms where there is a lot of glare, Apple suggests the nano-texture glass option with even less reflectivity.<br/>

		<title>iPhone 16 Pro Max Could Feature Longest-Ever Battery Life</title>

		<description><![CDATA[The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/">iPhone 16 Pro</a> Max could feature the longest-ever battery life offered in an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>, according to rumors detailing some of the upcoming high-end &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;'s improvements coming out of Korea.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/iPhone-16-Pro-Mock-Header-Updated.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-924442" /><br/>
Citing supply chain sources in a <a href="https://m.blog.naver.com/PostView.naver?blogId=yeux1122&logNo=223348524506&navType=by">post last week</a>, the Naver user known as "yeux1122" corroborates a series of rumors about the &zwnj;iPhone 16 Pro&zwnj;, such as its display size increase from 6.1- to 6.3-inches. They explain that the device's increased chassis size and internal changes enable the device to offer increased optical zoom capabilities, likely referring to the adoption of the tetraprism 5x telephoto camera first introduced last year on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a> Max. <br/>
<br/>
The user added that the size increase will likely be barely noticeable compared to the current model, but it will still have larger bezels than Samsung's Galaxy S24. The device is also set to feature a similar-sized or larger battery. The &zwnj;iPhone 16 Pro&zwnj; was the only device in the lineup missing from a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/07/some-iphone-16s-to-feature-bigger-batteries/">report last week</a> that detailed the next-generation iPhones' battery capacities.<br/>
<br/>
In a <a href="https://m.blog.naver.com/PostView.naver?blogId=yeux1122&logNo=223350403755&navType=by">follow-up post</a>, the Naver user explained that many of the &zwnj;iPhone 16 Pro&zwnj;'s components will benefit from improved power consumption. Most strikingly, the report added that the &zwnj;iPhone 16 Pro&zwnj; Max will contain a larger battery to reach the longest-ever battery life offered in an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;. The &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; Max currently touts a 29-hour battery life, so perhaps the &zwnj;iPhone 16 Pro&zwnj; Max will tick over 30 hours for the first time ever. <br/>
<br/>
Last week's report suggested that the &zwnj;iPhone 16 Pro&zwnj; Max will feature a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/07/some-iphone-16s-to-feature-bigger-batteries/">5% larger battery</a> than its predecessor for a total of 4,676 mAh. While this is only a very small increase, it is possible that other efficiency savings could help boost the device's overall battery life.<br/>
<br/>
Other details outlined on Naver include the rumor that the &zwnj;iPhone 16 Pro&zwnj; models will continue to feature 8GB of memory, and that Apple has apparently improved the manufacturing process of the device's titanium frame while reducing costs. The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a> lineup is expected to be announced in the fall.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Later next month, iPhone owners running iOS 17.4 will be able to generate a virtual card number for spending Apple Cash when Apple Pay isn't an online option, according to reports from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AppleCard/comments/1acdqol/we_finally_have_access_to_the_full_apple_cash/">Reddit users</a> running the latest iOS 17.4 beta (via <em><a href="https://9to5mac.com/2024/02/11/apple-cash-virtual-card-number-feature/">9to5Mac</a></em>).<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/apple-cash-virtual-card-number.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-935966" /><br/>
An Apple Cash pre-paid card allows users to send peer-to-peer Apple Pay payments to friends and family, transfer money to bank accounts, pay off their Apple Card, or spend money online via Apple Pay.<br/>
<br/>
With the new virtual card feature, Apple Cash users will be able to spend their balance even if Apple Pay is not supported by an online store. <br/>
<br/>
According to users with Apple Card on the iOS 17.4 beta, there's new a pop-up inviting them to set up a virtual card number, which Apple says will "keep your card information safe with a new security code for every transaction."<br/>
<br/>
Once generated, the card number can be accessed using Safari AutoFill, and used to shop online "where Apple Pay is not available." Users can also view the card number in Wallet, as well as generate new card numbers and CVC codes.<br/>
<br/>
As <em>9to5Mac</em> notes, the feature may not have been rolled out yet to every beta user. If you're running iOS 17.4 beta and use Apple Cash, you can check by opening the Wallet app, tapping your Apple Cash card, and checking for the option to "Set Up Virtual Card Number."<br/>
<br/>
Apple last month confirmed that iOS 17.4 will be released at some point in March. The upcoming software update includes <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ios-17-4-beta-features/">several new features and changes</a> for the iPhone, as outlined in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ios-17-4-beta-features/">our list</a>.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-pay-cash/">Apple Pay Cash</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-card/">Apple Card</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-cash/">Apple Cash</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/12/ios-17-4-beta-apple-cash-virtual-number/">iOS 17.4 Beta Lets Apple Cash Users Generate Virtual Card Numbers</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-17-4-beta-lets-apple-cash-users-generate-virtual-card-numbers.2419240/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Realizing the Apple Vision Pro headset's "ideal form" could take four successive generations of the device, some people in Apple's Vision Products Group believe. That's according to well-connected <em>Bloomberg</em> reporter Mark Gurman. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/Apple-Vision-Pro-at-Steve-Jobs-Theater.jpeg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-898794" /><br/>
Writing in his latest <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-02-11/apple-vision-pro-review-3-499-headset-will-eventually-replace-the-ipad-lshk59z1">Power On</a> newsletter, Gurman says the feeling amongst some of the team working on Apple's headset is that there is much work to do before the device can be considered refined enough for customers to use on a day-to-day basis.   <br/>
<br/>
While it's not clear what Apple's development team consider to be the device's "ideal form," it's easy enough to take cues from some early adopters, whose issues with the first-generation device have extended to both the hardware and the software. <br/>
<br/>
Many Vision Pro users feel the headset itself is too heavy and unwieldy for extended use, making generational miniaturization a crucial touchstone for improvement. Other criticisms have included poor battery life, not enough dedicated apps, and a preponderance of bugs in visionOS.<br/>
<br/>
If Apple's team can resolve those issues over four generations â€“ similar to the progression of the iPhone, iPad and Apple Watch â€“ Gurman's take is that the Vision Pro could eventually replace the iPad. <br/>
<br/>
Apple has had "mixed results" in attempting to position the iPad as more of a Mac replacement, Gurman says. Despite Apple's efforts to make it a multitasking device with features like Stage Manager, the iPad has struggled to become a true productivity workhorse like the Mac, and now sits in a limbo amongst Apple's other offerings. "The device lost its original purpose and has become a more confusing piece of Apple's product portfolio," writes Gurman. <br/>
<br/>
As for Vision Pro, which starts at &#36;3,500, "it's going to take some hardware upgrades, a slew of software updates, and far better support from app developers and content makers to actually make the headset the iPad replacement that it's capable of being," adds Gurman. "Until then, the Vision Pro is essentially a prototype â€” just one where you have to pay Apple for the privilege of testing it out."<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/bloomberg-com/">Bloomberg</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AppleVisionPro">Vision Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-vision-pro.209">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/11/apple-vision-pro-fourth-generation-ideal/">Apple Vision Pro Could Take Four Generations to Reach &#039;Ideal Form&#039;</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-vision-pro-could-take-four-generations-to-reach-ideal-form.2419188/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[In an <a href="https://twitter.com/StellaFudge/status/1756365322301423616">internal memo</a> shared with Apple Authorized Service Providers this week, Apple said it is "aware of" and "investigating" a touch-related issue affecting some Apple Watch Series 9 and Apple Watch Ultra 2 displays.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/08/apple-watch-series-9-display.jpeg" alt="" width="1960" height="1102" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-913380" /><br/>
"Some customers may report their Apple Watch Series 9 or Apple Watch Ultra 2 is experiencing false touches on their display," reads Apple's memo, obtained by <em>MacRumors</em>. Apple said some customers may describe the issue as "ghost" touches.<br/>
<br/>
The issue may cause the screen on affected Apple Watch models to "jump erratically" or exhibit other unexpected behavior, without any user interaction, according to Apple. The memo said the issue can also result in an Apple Watch starting a phone call unintentionally, and prevent users from entering the device's passcode.<br/>
<br/>
Apple recommends that customers keep their Apple Watch's software up to date, suggesting that the company is hopeful it will be able to address the issue in a future watchOS update. Apple did not say how widespread the issue is, or provide a timeframe for a potential fix. It is unclear if defective hardware is a contributing factor.<br/>
<br/>
Apple has instructed technicians not to repair affected Apple Watch models while it investigates. In the meantime, technicians are told to ask customers who are experiencing this issue to force restart their Apple Watch by holding down the Digital Crown and the side button at the same time for at least 10 seconds, until the Apple logo appears.<br/>
<br/>
Apple Watch Series 9 and Apple Watch Ultra 2 models were released in September 2023.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch/">Apple Watch Series 9</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch-ultra/">Apple Watch Ultra 2</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/aasp/">Apple Authorized Service Providers</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch">Apple Watch (Neutral)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch_Ultra">Apple Watch Ultra (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-watch.172">Apple Watch</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/10/apple-watch-series-9-ultra-2-touch-screen-issue/">Apple Investigating &#039;Ghost Touches&#039; Issue Affecting Some Series 9 and Ultra 2 Watches</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-investigating-ghost-touches-issue-affecting-some-series-9-and-ultra-2-watches.2419114/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple Vision Pro has been out for a week, so regular users are starting to get settled in with the new device and sharing their thoughts on it while teardown experts have been digging into the hardware.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/top-stories-10feb2024.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-935854" /><br/>
Beyond all the news surrounding Apple's long-anticipated headset, this week also saw more progress on iOS 17.4 and related operating system updates expected to launch next month, fresh iPhone 16 rumors, and more, so read on below for all the details on these stories and more!<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Apple Vision Pro Apps to Check Out</h2><br/>
Following the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/02/vision-pro-unboxing/">launch of Apple's new Vision Pro headset</a> on Friday, we shared an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/vision-pro-app-list/">in-depth list of apps optimized for the visionOS operating system</a>, from both larger and smaller developers.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/Vision-Pro-Apps-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-934149" /><br/>
Apple announced that <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/01/apple-vision-pro-over-600-native-apps/">over 600 apps have been optimized for visionOS</a> so far, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/vision-pro-app-list/">our list highlights many notable ones</a>, while we've also <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/09/top-10-vision-pro-apps/">shared a video looking at ten of our favorites</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Vision Pro is also compatible with more than one million iPad and iPhone apps.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>iFixit Shares Apple Vision Pro Teardown</h2><br/>
Repair website iFixit recently shared <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/03/ifixit-apple-vision-pro-teardown/">written and video teardowns of the Apple Vision Pro</a>, providing a closer look inside the headset. The headset is an engineering feat, with an array of cameras, sensors, fans, and many other precisely-arranged components.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/iFixit-Vision-Pro-Teardown.jpeg" alt="" width="1280" height="720" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-934613" /><br/>
iFixit also shared some technical details about the Vision Pro's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/07/ifixit-vision-pro-displays-and-repairability/">internal and external displays, battery pack, repairability, and more</a> in a separate video.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>iOS 17.4 Beta: All the New Features</h2><br/>
Apple last month confirmed that iOS 17.4 will be released at some point in March. The upcoming software update includes <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ios-17-4-beta-features/">several new features and changes for the iPhone</a>, as outlined in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ios-17-4-beta-features/">our list</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/iOS-17.4-Feature-Blue.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-932462" /><br/>
Key new features include <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/26/iphone-changes-coming-to-eu-users/">major App Store changes in the EU</a>, Apple Podcasts transcripts, SharePlay for the HomePod, and new emoji. The update also prepares for the launch of next-generation CarPlay later this year.<br/>
<br/>
Apple also <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/08/apple-releases-ios-17-3-1-with-fix-for-text-bug/">released iOS 17.3.1 with a text-related bug fix</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Apple Testing Slim Camera Bump Design for Base iPhone 16</h2><br/>
The standard iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus models launching later this year <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/06/apple-iphone-16-slim-camera-bump/">could be equipped with a slim, vertical, pill-shaped rear camera bump</a>, according to leaked schematics.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/iPhone-16-Camera-Lozenge-2-Colors-Gray.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-935282" /><br/>
The return to vertically-aligned rear camera lenses would allow for spatial video recording on the iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus. The feature is currently exclusive to the Pro models in the iPhone 15 lineup.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Apple Now Selling Refurbished 14-inch M3 MacBook Pro</h2><br/>
Apple this week <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/07/apple-refurbished-14-inch-m3-macbook-pro/">added the 14-inch MacBook Pro with the standard M3 chip to its online refurbished store</a> for the first time since the laptop was released in November. Prices are discounted by around 15%.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/macbook-pro-bb-cyber.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-924141" /><br/>
Apple's certified refurbished products are nearly indistinguishable from brand new models, in our view, so they can be an attractive choice for customers who are looking for a discount directly from the company.<br/>
<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple has reached an agreement with Rivos, the SoC company <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/05/02/apple-sues-rivos-trade-secret-theft/">that it sued in 2022</a> for theft of trade secrets, reports <em><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-02-09/apple-is-settling-chip-secrets-theft-case-against-startup-rivos">Bloomberg</a></em>. Rivos will submit to a forensic examination of its systems to remove any confidential Apple information.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/apple-silicon-1-feature.jpg" alt="" width="1422" height="800" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-924673" /><br/>
Rivos hired more than 40 employees from Apple, including several former high-ranking engineers, leading Apple to file a lawsuit in May 2022. Apple accused Rivos of poaching employees and stealing chip trade secrets via those employees. Rivos is designing SoCs that would compete with Apple's A-series and M-series chips.<br/>
<br/>
According to Apple, at least two engineers hired by Rivos took "gigabytes of sensitive SoC specifications and design files" during their last few days at Apple. The employees used USB drives and AirDrop to transfer sensitive Apple material to their own personal devices, and allegedly stole presentations on unreleased SoCs.<br/>
<br/>
Apple asked for an injunction against the employees that joined Rivos to prevent them from continuing to leak sensitive data, and it sought compensation for the loss caused by trade secret misappropriation and Rivos' "unjust enrichment" at Apple's expense. Apple wanted a "reasonable royalty rate" from Rivos on future products, and had requested a jury trial.<br/>
<br/>
Rivos and Apple are aiming to finalize their settlement by March 15, and are working through the remediation process.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/lawsuit/">Apple Lawsuits</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/09/apple-settles-rivos-lawsuit/">Apple to Settle Trade Secret Lawsuit With SoC Startup Rivos</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-to-settle-trade-secret-lawsuit-with-soc-startup-rivos.2419053/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The Vision Pro launched with its own dedicated <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a>, and last Friday, there were more than 600 Vision Pro-optimized apps available for download. We thought we'd pull out 10 of the best apps to check out on Vision Pro, both for day-to-day use and for showing off the capabilities of the headset.<br/>

 	<li><strong><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/blackbox-for-vision/id6458588937">Blackbox</a></strong> (&#36;19.99) - Blackbox is a puzzle game where you manipulate orbs, bubbles, and other objects to explore different visuals and sounds on Vision Pro. It is one of the more unique experiences on Apple's headset. The game is under active development and new puzzles will be added over time.</li><br/>
 	<li><strong><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/spatial-symphony/id6476616491">Spatial Symphony</a></strong> (Free, &#36;6.99 for Pro)- Spatial Symphony gives you a way to visually interact with and create music.

		<description><![CDATA[For this week's giveaway, we've teamed up with <a href="https://www.colorware.com/">ColorWare</a> to offer <em>MacRumors</em> readers a chance to win <a href="https://www.colorware.com/p-1466-colorware-apple-number-2-pencil.aspx?c=variant-15y">a custom Apple Pencil 2</a> that's been painted to look like an actual number 2 pencil.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/colorware-apple-2-pencil-1.jpg" alt="" width="2560" height="1536" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-935830" /><br/>
ColorWare is a company that makes custom-painted Apple products and accessories, and ordering from ColorWare is essentially the only way to get a non-standard color for AirPods, the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-pencil/">Apple Pencil</a>, the Magic Mouse, and AirTags.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/colorware-apple-2-pencil-2.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1000" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-935831" /><br/>
Occasionally, ColorWare comes out with super fun special edition products, such as the new <a href="https://www.colorware.com/p-1466-colorware-apple-number-2-pencil.aspx?c=variant-15y">ColorWare Apple Number 2 Pencil</a>. This is an &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; 2 that has a black tip, yellow body, painted-on eraser, and other detailing for a faithful rendering of a number 2 pencil.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/colorware-apple-2-pencil-3.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1000" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-935832" /><br/>
ColorWare is making a limited number of the Apple Number 2 Pencils, and they're priced at &#36;215. That's an &#36;86 premium over the &#36;129 price tag, but the extra cost is worth it for a unique design that will make your <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> stand out. To get the pencil-like effect, ColorWare has combined matte, metallic, and glossy paints for the pencil, and it comes in a special edition box.<br/>
<br/>
ColorWare has been designing and selling custom-painted devices for more than two decades, and it has perfected the steps needed for a gorgeous, durable finish. ColorWare uses a multi-step coating process that includes a primer, the application of a proprietary color formula, and an X2 liquid plastic coating that protects the color. All ColorWare products are warrantied for 12 months.<br/>
<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[On this week's episode of <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/podcast/one-week-with-apple-vision-pro-ft-quinn-nelson-snazzy-labs/id1602394741?i=1000644778180">The MacRumors Show</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@snazzy">Snazzy Labs</a>' Quinn Nelson joins us to talk about the first week using Apple's long-awaited Vision Pro headset.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HRpqWpAHBXE?si=KFaZVrW4_0XwAm62" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe><em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@themacrumorsshow?sub_confirmation=1">Subscribe to The MacRumors Show YouTube channel</a> for more videos</em></div><br/>
Now that they each have one, Quinn and Dan discuss whether the Vision Pro meets their expectations. A significant portion of our dialogue is dedicated to the technical aspects of the Vision Pro, including its display quality, brightness, and the challenges users might face with hand gestures and text selection. The conversation progresses to evaluate the device's text sharpness, its implications for productivity, and how comfortable it feels with the two headband options.<br/>
<br/>
An interesting part of our discussion compares the Vision Pro with other VR headsets in the market. We highlight the distinct features of the Vision Pro that set it apart, especially its distortion correction capabilities and suitability for productivity tasks, contrasting it with the Meta Quest's gaming prowess. We also explore the potential for third-party headbands, future customization, and design possibilities, emphasizing Apple's unique position in the VR landscape and its differing approach from rivals.<br/>
<br/>
We ponder the coexistence of Apple and Meta within the VR space, acknowledging the competition but also recognizing the distinctive strengths and target audiences each company caters to. This leads to a broader discussion about the challenges current VR headsets face, such as eye strain, and the optimistic outlook for technological improvements over time that could mitigate these issues.<br/>
<br/>
A considerable part of our discussion tackles the technicalities and challenges surrounding Personas and face scanning with the Vision Pro, including the influence of factors like face shape, hair, and lighting conditions on the accuracy of these features. Quinn also shares insights on the integration of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> apps with the Vision Pro, highlighting how this has transformed his workflow in certain instances and the potential it unlocks for productivity.<br/>
<br/>
Despite the mix of frustrations and amazement the Vision Pro has brought, we come to a consensus acknowledging the exciting possibilities the device offers for the future of VR and productivity, considering whether or not we would recommend Apple's headset to others.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[iOS 18 and iPadOS 18 will feature visionOS-inspired design elements, according to a rumor shared this week by <a href="https://theverifier.co.il/62189/exclusive-apple-ios-18-visionos/">Israeli website <em>The Verifier</em></a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/visionOS-design.jpeg" alt="" width="1800" height="1012" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-935810" /><br/>
For example, the report claims that the Apple TV app on iPadOS 18 will feature the same translucent navigation bar that was <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/26/apple-tv-app-redesign-tvos-17-2/">introduced in the tvOS 17.2 version of the app</a> last year. The design of this menu draws similarities to visionOS, the operating system that runs on Apple's new Vision Pro headset, which launched in the U.S. last week.<br/>
<br/>
Apple also plans to redesign various other system menus and built-in apps on iOS 18, including Safari, according to the report.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/apple-tv-app-redesign.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-918880" /><div class="center-wrap"><em>Apple TV app menu bar on tvOS 17.2</em></div><br/>
We consider this rumor to be "sketchy" because <em>The Verifier</em> has a <a href="https://appletrack.com/the-verifier/">mixed track record</a> with Apple rumors over the years.<br/>
<br/>
Apple will introduce iOS 18 at its annual developers conference WWDC in June, and the first beta should be available shortly after the announcement. The update will be released to all users in September alongside the iPhone 16 lineup.

		<description><![CDATA[With much of the tech industry's focus recently taken up by <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple's Vision Pro</a> headset, you'd be forgiven for thinking that iPhone rumors have been few and far between over the last few months. Fortunately, that's not the case. Rumors and leaks about the iPhone 16 series continue to surface, and taken together, Apple's next-generation 2024 smartphone lineup looks like it could turn out to be a major upgrade.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/12/iPhone-16-Pro-Sizes-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-927877" /><br/>
To bring you up to speed, we've summarized below the biggest iPhone 16 rumors we've covered so far here on <em>MacRumors</em>. For more details, follow the links, or dive into our dedicated roundups for both <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/">iPhone 16 Pro</a> models, which are expected to arrive in September.<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px; color: #4A90E2; margin-top: 2px;"><br/>
    1. Larger Displays</span><br><br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 14px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #4A90E2; padding: 3px 6px; border-radius: 4px; margin-bottom: 2px;">Biggest Ever iPhones</span><br><br/>
This year's iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max are rumored to be getting <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/08/iphone-16-pro-larger-display-sizes/">bigger display sizes</a>, increasing to 6.27- and 6.86-inches, respectively. For comparison, the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max are equipped with 6.1-inch and 6.7-inch displays, respectively. The new display sizes would be the largest ever for the iPhone.<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px; color: #4A90E2; margin-top: 2px;"><br/>
    2. Vertical Camera Layout</span><br><br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 14px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #4A90E2; padding: 3px 6px; border-radius: 4px; margin-bottom: 2px;">iPhone 16 & iPhone 16 Plus</span><br><br/>
Apple's iPhone 16 base models will feature a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/06/apple-iphone-16-slim-camera-bump/">vertical camera arrangement</a> with a pill-shaped raised surface, instead of a diagonal camera arrangement like the iPhone 15. The new camera bump features two separate camera rings for the Wide and Ultrawide cameras. The vertical camera layout is expected to enable Spatial Video recording, which is currently limited to the iPhone 15 Pro models.<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px; color: #4A90E2; margin-top: 2px;"><br/>
3. Battery Changes</span><br><br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 14px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #4A90E2; padding: 3px 6px; border-radius: 4px; margin-bottom: 2px;">All iPhone 16 Models</span><br><br/>
One rumor suggests the â€ŒiPhone 16â€Œ and iPhone 16 Pro Max will feature <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/07/some-iphone-16s-to-feature-bigger-batteries/">larger batteries</a> than their predecessors, but the â€ŒiPhone 16â€Œ Plus may have reduced capacity. The iPhone 16 is said to have a 6% increase over the iPhone 15, with the iPhone 16 Pro Max gaining a 5% increase. In contrast, the iPhone 16 Plus is rumored to have a 9% reduction in capacity. On the other hand, Apple could also potentially use <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/07/25/iphone-15-hybrid-lens-rumor/">stacked battery technology</a> to increase energy density and prolong lifespan. <br/>

4. Capture Button</span><br><br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 14px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #4A90E2; padding: 3px 6px; border-radius: 4px; margin-bottom: 2px;">New Camera Capabilities</span><br><br/>
All iPhone 16 models will have a new "<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/18/iphone-16-capture-button-touch-pressure/">Capture Button</a>" dedicated to triggering image or video capture. The button will add features like the ability to zoom in and out by swiping left and right on the button, focus on a subject with a light press, and activate a recording with a more forceful press. The Capture Button will be located on the bottom right side of the â€ŒiPhone 16, and will take the place of the mmWave antenna on U.S. â€ŒiPhoneâ€Œ models, with the antenna relocating to the left side of the device below the volume and Action buttons.<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px; color: #4A90E2; margin-top: 2px;"><br/>
5. Ultra Wide Lens Upgrade</span><br><br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 14px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #4A90E2; padding: 3px 6px; border-radius: 4px; margin-bottom: 2px;">iPhone 16 Pro & iPhone 16 Pro Max</span><br><br/>
The iPhone 16 Pro models are expected to feature an upgraded <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/15/iphone-16-pro-wifi-7-48mp-ultra-wide-rumors/">48-megapixel Ultra Wide camera lens</a>, which should allow it to capture more light, resulting in improved photos when shooting in 0.5Ã— mode, especially in low-light environments. This also means that iPhone 16 Pro models should be able to shoot 48-megapixel ProRAW photos in Ultra Wide mode. These photos retain more detail in the image file for more editing flexibility, and can be printed at large sizes.<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px; color: #4A90E2; margin-top: 2px;"><br/>
5. Super Telephoto Camera</span><br><br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 14px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #4A90E2; padding: 3px 6px; border-radius: 4px; margin-bottom: 2px;">iPhone 16 Pro Max</span><br><br/>
The iPhone 16 Pro Max could be the first to feature a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/07/18/iphone-16-pro-max-super-telephoto-camera/">super telephoto periscope camera</a> for dramatically increased optical zoom. "Super" or "ultra" telephoto usually describes cameras with a focal length of over 300mm. The current telephoto lens is equivalent to a 77mm lens, so if accurate, there could be a notable increase in zoom capabilities. Super telephoto cameras are often used for sports and wild animal photography, but the extremely soft backgrounds they create also make them useful for portrait photography, providing there is enough distance between the subject and the photographer.<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px; color: #4A90E2; margin-top: 2px;"><br/>
6. Faster Wi-Fi Support</span><br><br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 14px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #4A90E2; padding: 3px 6px; border-radius: 4px; margin-bottom: 2px;">Wi-Fi 6E & Wi-Fi 7</span><br><br/>
Apple's 2024 iPhone Pro models are expected to get <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/15/iphone-16-pro-wifi-7-48mp-ultra-wide-rumors/">Wi-Fi 7 in the Pro models</a>, enabling data transfer over the 2.4GHz, 5GHz, and 6GHz bands simultaneously. This should result in faster Wi-Fi speeds, lower latency, and more reliable connectivity. With technologies such as 4K QAM, Wi-Fi 7 is  also expected to offer peak data transfer speeds of over 40 Gbps, a 4Ã— increase over Wi-Fi 6E. Meanwhile, the iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/14/iphone-16-and-16-plus-8gb-ram-rumor/">rumored to support Wi-Fi 6E</a>, which works with the 6 GHz band, enabling faster wireless speeds and reduced signal interference.<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px; color: #4A90E2; margin-top: 2px;"><br/>
7. New AXX Series Chips</span><br><br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 14px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #4A90E2; padding: 3px 6px; border-radius: 4px; margin-bottom: 2px;">A17 & A18 Pro Variants</span><br><br/>
Apple's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/27/iphone-16-lineup-a18-a18-pro-chips-analyst-says/">next-generation A18 Pro chip</a> is expected to be manufactured with TSMC's second-generation 3nm process, known as N3E. All four iPhone 16 models will be equipped with A18-branded chips, according to one rumor. Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/25/iphone-16-first-chip-designed-for-standard/">another rumor</a> counter-claims that the iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus will have A17 chips made using a different manufacturing process to the A17 Pro in the iPhone 15 Pro. The â€ŒiPhone 15 Proâ€Œ's A17 Pro chip is fabricated using TSMC's N3B process, but Apple reportedly plans to switch to the lower-cost N3E process for next year's standard A17 chip designed for the â€ŒiPhone 16â€Œ and â€ŒiPhone 16â€Œ Plus. <br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px; color: #4A90E2; margin-top: 2px;"><br/>
7. 5G Qualcomm Modem</span><br><br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 14px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #4A90E2; padding: 3px 6px; border-radius: 4px; margin-bottom: 2px;">iPhone 16 Pro & iPhone 16 Pro Max</span><br><br/>
Apple is expected to use <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/12/iphone-16-pro-5g-advanced-rumor/">Qualcomm's latest Snapdragon X75 modem</a> in this year's Pro and Pro Max models. The Snapdragon X75 includes improved carrier aggregation and other technology advancements for faster 5G download and upload speeds compared to the X70, which is used in iPhone 15 models. The modem's combined mmWave and sub-6GHz 5G transceiver also takes up 25% less circuit board space, and is said to use up to 20% less power. The standard iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus are expected to retain the Snapdragon X70 modem.<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px; color: #4A90E2; margin-top: 2px;"><br/>
8. Tetraprism Lens</span><br><br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 14px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #4A90E2; padding: 3px 6px; border-radius: 4px; margin-bottom: 2px;">iPhone 16 Pro</span><br><br/>
Both iPhone 16 Pro models are <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/18/iphone-16-pro-tetraprism-lens-rumor/">expected to feature 5x optical zoom</a>, which is currently exclusive to the iPhone 15 Pro Max. Apple's tetraprism lens system has a "folded" design that allows it to fit inside the smartphone, enabling up to 5x optical zoom and up to 25x digital zoom. In contrast, the current smaller iPhone 15 Pro is limited to up to 3x optical zoom, which is in line with the iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max.<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px; color: #4A90E2; margin-top: 2px;"><br/>
10. Micro-Lens Technology</span><br><br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 14px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #4A90E2; padding: 3px 6px; border-radius: 4px; margin-bottom: 2px;">More Efficient OLED</span><br><br/>
Apple is said to be weighing up the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/01/iphone-16-oled-displays-micro-lens-efficiency/">use of micro-lens technology</a> to maintain or increase the brightness of OLED displays on next year's iPhone 16 models while potentially reducing their power consumption. MLA works by using a uniform pattern of billions of lenses inside the panel that reduces internal reflections. These lenses turn the path of light reflected backwards from the inside of the panel towards the screen, which can serve either to increase perceived brightness while maintaining the same level of power consumption, or maintain brightness levels while consuming less power compared to conventional OLED panels at the same luminance.<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px; color: #4A90E2; margin-top: 2px;"><br/>
11. Action Button</span><br><br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 14px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #4A90E2; padding: 3px 6px; border-radius: 4px; margin-bottom: 2px;">iPhone 16 & iPhone 16 Plus</span><br><br/>
The iPhone 15 Pro models include an Action Button, and in 2024, the Action Button is expected to be <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/30/iphone-16-action-button-all-models/">expanded to the standard iPhone 16 models</a>. The Action Button used across the iPhone 16 lineup will be identical to the iPhone 15 Pro Action Button. The Action button, which replaces the traditional mute switch, can perform multiple functions such as activating the Flashlight, turning on the Camera, launching a Shortcut, enabling or disabling a Focus mode, using Translate, turning on/off Silent Mode, and more.<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px; color: #4A90E2; margin-top: 2px;"><br/>
12. Generative AI</span><br><br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 14px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #4A90E2; padding: 3px 6px; border-radius: 4px; margin-bottom: 2px;">Large Language Models</span><br><br/>
With iOS 18, Apple is rumored to be introducing new features powered by large language models (LLMs), although additional cutting-edge generative AI features could be <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/09/iphone-16-exclusive-ai-features-ios-18/">limited to the iPhone 16 models</a>. Apple is developing a large array of features that use generative AI, including a smarter version of Siri, improved interactions between Siri and the Messages app, auto-generated Apple Music playlists, integration with productivity apps for AI-assisted content creation, and more. <br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px; color: #4A90E2; margin-top: 2px;"><br/>
13. Upgraded Microphone</span><br><br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 14px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #4A90E2; padding: 3px 6px; border-radius: 4px; margin-bottom: 2px;">Enhanced Siri</span><br><br/>
Apple is said to be planning a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/07/apple-iphone-16-microphone-upgrade-siri-ai/">significant upgrade</a> to the iPhone 16 microphone to improve the new AI-enhanced Siri experience. Apple's Siri AI ambitions will heavily rely on improved voice input processing, and the new mic is expected to offer significantly enhanced signal-to-noise ratio.<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px; color: #4A90E2; margin-top: 2px;"><br/>
14. New Thermal Design</span><br><br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 14px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #4A90E2; padding: 3px 6px; border-radius: 4px; margin-bottom: 2px;">Reduced Heat</span><br><br/>
Apple is rumored to be working on a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/16/iphone-16-new-thermal-design/">graphene thermal system</a> for the â€ŒiPhone 16â€Œ lineup, while the â€ŒiPhone 16â€Œ Pro models could add metal battery casings to reduce overheating. Graphene has high thermal conductivity, surpassing that of copper, which is currently used in iPhone heat-sinks. Apple has been filing patents related to using graphene for thermal management for some time. The move could be in response to widely encountered overheating issues experienced with the iPhone 15 Pro, which Apple addressed through a software update.<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px; color: #4A90E2; margin-top: 2px;"><br/>
15. Expanded Storage</span><br><br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 14px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #4A90E2; padding: 3px 6px; border-radius: 4px; margin-bottom: 2px;">Both iPhone 16 Pro Models</span><br><br/>
The iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max will be available with double the maximum storage capacity as the iPhone 15 Pro models, increasing from 1TB to 2TB, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/19/iphone-16-pro-2tb-option-rumor/">according to one rumor</a>. The move is said to be a result of Apple's switch to higher-density Quad-Level Cell (QLC) NAND flash for higher storage models. Apple's use of QLC NAND could allow Apple to fit more storage into a smaller space and it is less expensive than Triple-Level Cell (TLC) NAND, which current iPhones use. On the downside, QLC has comparatively slower read and write speeds.<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px; color: #4A90E2; margin-top: 2px;"><br/>
15. Increased Memory</span><br><br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 14px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #4A90E2; padding: 3px 6px; border-radius: 4px; margin-bottom: 2px;">iPhone 16 & iPhone 16 Plus</span><br><br/>
Apple's iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus models have been rumored to both <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/14/iphone-16-and-16-plus-8gb-ram-rumor/">feature 8GB of RAM</a>, an increase over the 6GB of RAM in the iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus. More working memory should equate to improved performance for multitasking on the iPhone.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/">iPhone 16 Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/09/every-iphone-16-rumor-weve-covered-so-far/">Every iPhone 16 Rumor We&#039;ve Covered So Far</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/every-iphone-16-rumor-weve-covered-so-far.2419007/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Following a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2020/05/20/spotify-signs-up-the-joe-rogan-experience-podcast/">three-year absence</a>, the hugely popular and controversial podcast <em>The Joe Rogan Experience</em> is back on Apple Podcasts after Spotify gave up exclusivity as part of a multiyear deal renewal with Rogan.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/05/elon-musk-joe-rogan.jpg" alt="" width="1440" height="825" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-742668" /><div class="center-wrap"><em>(Image credit: POWERFULJRE/YOUTUBE)</em></div><br/>
In a <a href="https://x.com/joerogan/status/1755735654225334432?s=20">post on X</a> (formerly Twitter), Rogan on Thursday said that "the podcast is now officially back on @apple. We should be back on @youtube with full episodes in the coming weeks."<br/>
<br/>
Under the new deal, which is said to be worth up to &#36;250 million, Rogan's show will be available on other content platforms, including Apple Podcasts, Amazon Music, and YouTube. The move is part of Spotify's revised strategy to forego exclusive streaming rights in favor of broader distribution.<br/>
<br/>
As part of the renewed deal, first reported by <em><a href="https://www.wsj.com/business/media/joe-rogan-podcast-spotify-deal-28eb5f74">The Wall Street Journal</a></em>, Spotify will handle distribution and ad sales for the podcast. Rogan will receive a guaranteed minimum fee from Spotify as well as a cut of advertising revenue.<br/>
<br/>
"For more than three years, <em>The Joe Rogan Experience</em> has consistently been the No. 1 podcast across the globe," Spotify said when it announced the renewed deal last week. That accords with Edison Research's Q3 2023 survey of most listened-to podcasts, in which <em>The Joe Rogan Experience</em> ranked number 1 for the period. It was also the second most listened-to podcast for women 13 and older in the U.S., according to Edison.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The podcast is now officially back on <a href="https://twitter.com/Apple?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@apple</a><br>We should be back on <a href="https://twitter.com/YouTube?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@youtube</a> with full episodes in the coming weeks.

Since launching in December 2009, Rogan's podcast has involved candid and varied discussions on topics like politics, health, and society. In recent years it has gained notoriety through Rogan's practice of inviting guests that hold extreme or unconventional views. The show has also faced significant criticism for spreading misinformation and giving a platform to divisive figures.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-podcasts/">Apple Podcasts</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/09/joe-rogan-experience-apple-podcasts/">&#039;The Joe Rogan Experience&#039; Returns to Apple Podcasts After 3-Year Hiatus</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/the-joe-rogan-experience-returns-to-apple-podcasts-after-3-year-hiatus.2418999/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[EU developers can now add alternative app marketplaces to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a> Connect, <a href="https://developer.apple.com/news/releases/">Apple said today</a>. Apple is also accepting submissions for the Notarization process, which is required for all apps that will be distributed through alternative marketplaces.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/App-Store-vs-EU-Feature-2.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-932826" /><br/>
Apple is making these changes to &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; Connect ahead of the launch of iOS 17.4, an update that <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/25/ios-17-4-alternative-app-marketplaces-eu/">overhauls the app ecosystem in the European Union</a>. Alternative app marketplaces are special iOS apps that can be downloaded onto an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> from a website or a web browser, serving as an alternative to the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj;. App marketplaces are able to distribute iOS apps, giving developers a way to sell their apps without using the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
Both alternative marketplaces and apps that are added to the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; through one of the marketplaces are checked over by Apple to prevent malware, viruses, and similar malicious content.<br/>
<br/>
To add an alternative app marketplace or submit an app for Notarization, developers must <a href="https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=e59yuu15">agree to Apple's new business terms</a>. The business terms include a Core Technology Fee that requires app marketplaces to pay .50 euros per install, and apps to pay the same fee after 1 million installs.<br/>
<br/>
With alternative app marketplaces able to be added to &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; Connect, marketplace distribution and marketplace apps can be set up, and TestFlight can be used to beta test new features.<br/>
<br/>
TestFlight also supports apps that use alternative browser engines and alternative payments through third-party payment providers.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-developer-program/">Apple Developer Program</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store-connect/">App Store Connect</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/08/app-store-connect-alternative-app-marketplaces/">Apple Starts Letting Developers Add Alternative App Marketplaces to App Store Connect</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-starts-letting-developers-add-alternative-app-marketplaces-to-app-store-connect.2418959/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>
