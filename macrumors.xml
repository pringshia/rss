Amazon has every version of the iPad mini 6 on sale for record low prices today, and in every color, marking the first notable discounts on the tablet since Prime Day.<br/>
<br/>

Steep discounts on the iPad mini 6 have become more frequent recently as we're expecting a refresh of the tablet at <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/07/when-to-expect-next-ipad-mini/">some point later this year</a>, or possibly early next year. The iPad mini is Apple's smallest tablet device and this model features a slim-bezeled design, the A15 Bionic chip, a USB-C port, and Apple Pencil 2 support.<br/>

		<title>iPhone Driver&#039;s License Support Coming Soon to California</title>

		<description><![CDATA[iPhone and Apple Watch users in California will soon be able to add their digital ID and driver's license to the Wallet app, based on the discovery of landing pages on the state government DMV website explaining the feature to consumers.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/08/california-drivers-license.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-960760" /><br/>
"Now you can add your California driver's license or state ID to Apple Wallet on iPhone and Apple Watch so you can present it easily and securely in person and in app," reads the <a href="https://ws.uat.dmv.ca.gov/portal/california-mdl/inapplewallet/">landing page</a>, which contains broken links and placeholder images, and is still missing a proper website security certificate.<br/>
<br/>
The webpages were discovered on Sunday by Jimmy Obomsawin, after someone added a link to the landing pages in an Apple Wallet <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Wallet">Wikipedia entry</a> last Wednesday.<br/>
<br/>
Apple in 2022 enhanced the Wallet app with a new feature that's designed to allow driver's licenses and state ID cards to be stored in the app, but states need to implement support for the option. Rollout has been slow since the support was announced in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/01/apple-shares-us-states-adopting-wallet-ids/">September 2021</a>, with Ohio last week becoming only the fifth state to add support, following Arizona, Maryland, Colorado, and Georgia. The California DMV received permission to start testing mobile driver's licenses and ID cards with a limited number of people soon after Apple announced the support.<br/>
<br/>
If you live in one of the five supported states, you can add your state ID card to iPhone by opening the Wallet app and tapping the + button. After selecting your state ID, simply scan the front and back of the physical card, then send a photo of yourself to the state DMV for additional verification. IDs and licenses stored in the Wallet app can be used in select U.S. airports at TSA checkpoints.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Amazon today has Apple's AirPods Max headphones at a near all-time low price of <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB08PZDSP2Z%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1"><strong>&#36;399.99</strong></a>, down from &#36;549.00. The last time we tracked a deal this low was during Prime Day in July, and today's price is just about &#36;5 higher compared to that sale.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
You'll find all five colors of the AirPods Max on sale this time: Green, Pink, Silver, Sky Blue, and Space Gray. Prime members can get the headphones delivered between August 6 and 7, while regular shipping should have them arrive by August 10.<br/>
<br/>

This includes the AirPods 2 for <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB07PXGQC1Q%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"><strong>&#36;79.99</strong></a>, down from &#36;129.00; the AirPods 3 for <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0D1WXVQTN%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"><strong>&#36;139.99</strong></a>, down from &#36;169.00; and the AirPods Pro 2 for <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0D1XD1ZV3%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"><strong>&#36;189.99</strong></a>, down from &#36;249.00.

		<description><![CDATA[WhatsApp is rolling out a new feature that lets users organize events within group chats, according to the release notes for the latest update.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/whatsapp-attachment-tray.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="880" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-950252" /><br/>
The new event planning feature lets users organize events, meetings, and social gatherings directly within a group chat. The feature was rolled out exclusively to Communities group chats in May, but the Meta-owned messaging platform is now rolling it out to all groups. From the <a href="https://blog.whatsapp.com/new-to-communities-events-and-replies-in-announcement-groups">WhatsApp blog</a>:<br/>
<blockquote>With events it's now easier for people to plan their get togethers directly in WhatsApp, whether it's setting up a virtual meeting or birthday dinner. Anyone can create an event and others can respond so the whole group knows who is coming. Guests can also find the event in the group's information page, and those going will get an automatic notification when it's getting close. </blockquote>To set up an event, tap the + button in the group and select Event. Users can choose an event name, optional description, a start date, location, and a WhatsApp call link (for either voice or video calls). When the event is created, a notification is sent to all the members in the group. WhatsApp says the option is rolling out now and progressively over the coming weeks.<br/>
<br/>
WhatsApp last month reached a significant milestone of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/28/whatsapp-reaches-100-million-monthly-us-users/">100 million monthly active users</a> in the United States, which unlike Europe is a market traditionally dominated by other messaging services such as SMS and iMessage. <div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/whatsapp/">WhatsApp</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/05/whatsapp-rolls-out-events-group-chats/">WhatsApp Rolls Out Events Planning Feature for All Group Chats</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/whatsapp-rolls-out-events-planning-feature-for-all-group-chats.2432960/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple customers who were affected by Apple's flawed MacBook butterfly keyboard design have begun receiving settlement funds, two years after Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/07/19/apple-butterfly-keyboard-lawsuit-settlement/">paid &#36;50 million</a> to settle a class action lawsuit.  <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/03/macbook-pro-butterfly-keyboard.jpg" alt="" width="1955" height="1100" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-790219" /><br/>
Emails about the lawsuit were sent out in December 2022 to MacBook owners eligible for a payment. In June 2024, the court <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/01/macbook-pro-butterfly-keyboard-payout/">issued a payment order</a>, with payments set to be issued for approved claims by August 2024. <br/>
<br/>
MacBook owners who had at least two topcase replacements from Apple within four years of purchase will receive a maximum of &#36;395, while customers who had one topcase repair will receive up to &#36;125. Those who had keycap replacements are eligible for up to &#36;50.<br/>
<br/>
Apple used butterfly keyboards in Macs from 2015 to 2019. Although the design was updated several times during this period, the butterfly mechanism was known for its susceptibility to failure. Thousands of customers experienced issues such as repeating keys, sticking keys, and complete keyboard failures, often due to crumbs, dust, and other debris.<br/>
<br/>
In response, Apple launched a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2018/06/22/apple-macbook-pro-keyboard-repair-program/">repair program</a> in June 2018, covering the MacBook, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/">MacBook Air</a>, and MacBook Pro models manufactured from 2015 onward. However, this program only covered devices for four years after purchase. Additionally, because faulty butterfly keyboards were replaced with the same butterfly mechanism, no permanent fix was provided.<br/>
<br/>
Due to the widespread failure of the butterfly keyboard, Apple eventually switched back to the more reliable scissor switch mechanism. Since late 2019, all new Macs have featured scissor switch keyboards, which are more durable and better able to withstand everyday wear and tear.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/butterfly-keyboard-issues/">Butterfly Keyboard Issues</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/05/macbook-faulty-keyboard-payouts/">MacBook Owners With Faulty Butterfly Keyboards Begin Receiving Payouts</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/macbook-owners-with-faulty-butterfly-keyboards-begin-receiving-payouts.2432952/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple will launch the iPhone 16 series within its traditional September timeframe this year, despite Apple Intelligence set to be absent in the first public release of iOS 18. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/12/iPhone-16-Pro-Sizes-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-927877" /><br/>
Writing in his latest <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-08-04/apple-intelligence-early-preview-in-call-recording-safari-summaries-new-siri-lzfk2949">Power On newsletter</a>, <em>Bloomberg</em> reporter Mark Gurman says his sources tell him that the iPhone launch will occur around the same time as last year, with Tuesday, September 10 suggested as a possible launch day candidate.<br/>
<br/>
Apple will ship the new iPhone lineup with its latest iOS 18 operating system, but users will not get Apple's initial set of AI features, collectively dubbed Apple Intelligence, until the release of iOS 18.1 a few weeks later in October. <br/>
<br/>
Apple and its investors are counting on Apple Intelligence to be a major draw that will attract new and upgrading iPhone customers, particularly since only the Pro models in the current iPhone 15 lineup are capable of powering the new features. But the company is not about to delay the launch of the iPhone 16 series just to coincide with the availability of Apple Intelligence.<br/>
<br/>
Gurman notes that ahead of the 2011 launch of the iPhone, Apple did choose to postpone the device's release from its then-usual June timing to October, in order to align it with the availability of iCloud and Siri, which were new online services at the time. This year, however, Gurman does not see the delayed arrival of Apple Intelligence as being a big enough issue to change Apple's hardware launch plans, especially given that the tools that will be rolled out first aren't particularly game-chaining on their own.<br/>
<br/>
Apple Intelligence features in the iOS 18.1 beta include Writing Tools for proofreading, rewriting, and summarizing text, a new Siri interface with Type to Siri, Mail and Messages app improvements like summarizing emails and Smart Reply, phone call recording, and audio transcription in Notes and other apps, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/29/ios-18-1-apple-intelligence-features/">more</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Some of the more significant and compelling Apple Intelligence features that Apple plans to introduce at a later date include Image Playground, Genmoji, ChatGPT integration with Siri, priority notifications, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/29/ios-18-1-apple-intelligence-unavailable-features/">several other additions</a>.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/">iPhone 16 Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/">Apple Intelligence</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/05/iphone-16-september-launch-on-track/">iPhone 16 Still Coming in September Despite Delayed Apple Intelligence Rollout</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-16-still-coming-in-september-despite-delayed-apple-intelligence-rollout.2432950/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple will update its MacBook Pro, Mac mini, and iMac lines with its latest M4 chip later this year, according to <em>Bloomberg</em> reporter Mark Gurman.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/M4-Real-Feature-Red.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-950311" /><br/>
Writing in his latest <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-08-04/apple-intelligence-early-preview-in-call-recording-safari-summaries-new-siri-lzfk2949">Power On newsletter</a>, Gurman said Apple is preparing to upgrade every Mac to the new Apple silicon processor generation. Following the launch of the M4 iPad Pro in May, Apple will continue the M4 transition with the above mentioned Macs, and complete it with updates for the MacBook Air, Mac Pro, and Mac Studio in 2025.<br/>
<br/>
One interesting tidbit from Gurman's latest report is that while the M4 overhaul is mostly focused on making Apple's machines more powerful – with the M4 processor's enhanced neural engine for handling AI tasks a standout upgrade – there is "at least one Mac model that will get more dramatic changes."<br/>
<br/>
Apple has said the ultra-thin 2024 iPad Pro serves as a model for its upcoming design philosophy, with the company planning to offer "the thinnest and lightest products" in each category across the tech industry. Gurman previously <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/17/apple-plans-thinner-iphone-slimmer-macbook/">reported</a> that Apple is working on a thinner version of the MacBook Pro. <br/>
<br/>
Whether these dramatic changes Gurman foresees relate to the design of Apple's Macs or the addition of a rumored new feature such as Face ID is unknown at this point. "Stay tuned," Gurman added.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/">iMac</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro/">MacBook Pro 14 & 16" </a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-mini/">Mac mini</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iMac">iMac (Neutral)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Pro_16">14" & 16" MacBook Pro (Caution)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Mac_Mini">Mac Mini (Caution)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/imac.91">iMac</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macbook-pro.90">MacBook Pro</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/mac-mini.146">Mac mini</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/05/m4-macbook-pro-mac-mini-imac-2024/">Gurman: M4 MacBook Pro, Mac Mini, and iMac Coming This Year</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/gurman-m4-macbook-pro-mac-mini-and-imac-coming-this-year.2432943/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The highly anticipated developer beta of Apple Intelligence is finally here, with an early limited set of AI-based features in iOS 18.1 and related updates that will expand over time.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/08/top-stories-3aug-2024.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-960691" /><br/>
The new iOS 18.1 beta also includes call recording and transcription, while macOS Sonoma 14.6 that was released to all users this week rolls out previously promised support for dual external displays on the 14-inch M3 MacBook Pro, so read on below for all the details!<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Apple Intelligence Now Available in iOS 18.1 Beta and More</h2><br/>
The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/29/apple-releases-ios-18-1-apple-intelligence/">first Apple Intelligence features are now available to test in the iOS 18.1 developer beta</a>, released earlier this week. The beta and features are limited to the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/Apple-Intelligence-General-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-956491" /><br/>
This means that iOS 18.0 and iOS 18.1 are now in beta testing simultaneously, with the public launch of the first Apple Intelligence features now delayed until iOS 18.1, which is likely to be released in October.<br/>
<br/>
The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/29/ios-18-1-apple-intelligence-features/">first features available to try</a> include new writing tools, suggested replies in the Messages app, email summarization, and more.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>See Apple Intelligence in Action</h2><br/>
As mentioned, Apple Intelligence is now available in the iOS 18.1 developer beta, as well as in the iPadOS 18.1 and macOS Sequoia 15.1 developer betas.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/Apple-Intelligence-Hands-On-Thumb-3.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-960267" /><br/>
We have <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/30/apple-intelligence-hands-on/">shared a video</a> that provides a quick <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/30/apple-intelligence-hands-on/">demonstration of some of the first new Apple Intelligence features</a> available on the iPhone, so be sure to give it a watch for a closer look. Also be sure to check out <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/29/ios-18-1-apple-intelligence-features/">our list of all of the Apple Intelligence features available so far</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>All of the Apple Intelligence Features Not Included in the iOS 18.1 Beta</h2><br/>
Apple Intelligence includes a wide range of new features for the iPhone, but <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/29/ios-18-1-apple-intelligence-unavailable-features/">not all of them are available to test in the first iOS 18.1 developer beta</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/image-playground.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-954521" /><br/>
For example, while Siri has a new design when invoked, the assistant does not yet have features such as deeper in-app controls, on-screen awareness, and personal context for the user. Apple said these additional features will roll out over the course of the next year.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>iOS 18.1 Beta Includes Call Recording and Transcribing</h2><br/>
Included within the first set of Apple Intelligence features in the iOS 18.1 beta is the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/29/ios-18-1-call-recording-and-transcribing/">ability to record phone calls, complete with transcriptions</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/ios-18-1-call-recording-1.jpg" alt="" width="5416" height="3047" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-960199" /><br/>
This feature, exclusive to the iPhone 15 Pro and the iPhone 15 Pro Max, notifies everyone on the call that it is being recorded through an audible message, so it is clear to all participants. After the call, you can play back its audio or read a transcription of what was said.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>macOS Sonoma 14.6 Adds Dual External Display Support to 14-Inch MacBook Pro With M3 Chip</h2><br/>
Apple earlier this year said that it would add support for dual external displays in clamshell mode to the 14-inch MacBook Pro with the M3 chip, and that functionality has <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/29/macos-sonoma-14-6-dual-display-support/">now arrived in macOS Sonoma 14.6</a>, released to the public earlier this week.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/macbook-pro-m3-new-blue.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-959391" /><br/>
This means the latest 14-inch MacBook Pro model now works with dual external displays when the laptop's lid is closed, just like the latest MacBook Air models.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>The MacRumors Show: Apple Intelligence Beta is Here</h2><br/>
With an early set of Apple Intelligence features now available to developers, we're getting our first taste of how well they work in real-world settings as Apple looks toward a public release later in the year.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/08/The-MacRumors-Show-Apple-Intelligence-Beta-Thumb-2.jpg" alt="" width="3840" height="2160" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-960626" /><br/>
On the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/02/the-macrumors-show-apple-intelligence-beta/">latest episode of The MacRumors Show podcast</a>, hosts Dan Barbera and Hartley Charlton discussed the unusual move of having both iOS 18.0 and iOS 18.1 in beta testing and shared their early thoughts on the new Apple Intelligence features.

		<description><![CDATA[Major changes are coming to the Messages app with <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a>, with Apple adding several fun Apple Intelligence features, new formatting, updated effects, satellite support, better texting with green bubble people, and tons more.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/iOS-18-Messages-Feature-1.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-955693" /><br/>
This guide highlights everything that's new in the &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj; Messages app.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="send_later">Send Later</h2><br/>
&zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj; adds the option to schedule an iMessage to be sent to someone at a later time or date. If you know someone's birthday is coming up, for example, you can schedule a happy birthday text to them ahead of the date so it's ready to go.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/08/ios-18-messages-send-later.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-960705" /><br/>
Scheduling a message can be only be done in conversations with other iMessage users, and it is not an option when texting with an Android user. It works in both individual and group chats, as long as all participants have an Apple device and access to iMessage.<br/>
<br/>
To schedule a message, follow these steps:<br/>
<ol><br/>
 <li>Open up a conversation in the Messages app.</li><br/>
 <li>Tap on the "+" button on the left side of the text box.</li><br/>
 <li>Tap on More.</li><br/>
 <li>Choose Send Later.</li><br/>
 <li>Type in your Message.</li><br/>
 <li>To change the send time, tap on the blue bubble that defaults to Tomorrow 9:00 am. From there, you will have a slider that lets you input a date and a time.</li><br/>
 <li>With your time selected and your message typed in, tap on the blue arrow to schedule it.</li><br/>
</ol><br/>
Messages can be scheduled up to 14 days in advance, so if it's August 1, for example, you can schedule up to August 15. Messages are sent even if your <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> is offline without a Wi-Fi or cellular connection.<br/>
<br/>
Scheduled messages are displayed at the bottom of a conversation. If you want to change the time of a message or cancel it, tap on the "Edit" button. You will have options to edit the time, delete the message, or send it immediately.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="tapback_reactions">Tapback Reactions</h2><br/>
Tapbacks are those little characters you can use to respond to a message by long pressing on it, so you don't need to type out a whole response to something that can be answered with a thumbs up or a heart. &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj; has two key updates for Tapbacks.<br/>
<br/>
<h3 id="updated_design">Updated Design</h3><br/>
The six standard Tapback icons now feature color and more detail. You can see the new look when long pressing on a text to respond, and in the Tapbacks that you receive.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/08/ios-18-messages-tapback-colors.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-960707" /><br/>
When you tap on a Tapback you've received on a message, you can now see who sent what, which is useful if you are in a group chat and get multiple Tapback responses.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/08/ios-18-messages-tapback-info.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-960708" /><br/>
<h3 id="emoji_support">Emoji Support</h3><br/>
Along with the six classic Tapback responses, you can now choose any emoji character when using Tapback. After long pressing to respond to a message, swipe to the left to see common emoji responses or tap on the generic emoji icon thought bubble to bring up the emoji picker.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/08/ios-18-messages-tapback-emoji.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-960706" /><br/>
You can choose any emoji, but you can also select from your stickers or your Memoji. Tap on the Memoji icon at the bottom left to get to Memoji, or the sticker icon to see your sticker selections. To add one as a Tapback, just tap on your selection.<br/>
<br/>
Stickers can be hard to see at the small size of a Tapback, but most emoji characters and Memoji work well.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="rcs">RCS</h2><br/>
<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/rcs/">RCS</a>, or Rich Communication Services, is a new text message protocol replacing SMS and MMS. You'll see it when texting people who don't have iMessage, such as Android users. &zwnj;RCS&zwnj; has nothing to do with iMessage conversations, aka the conversations you have with other Apple device owners (blue bubbles), but it does improve texts with green bubble Android users.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/apple-rcs-thumb.jpg" alt="" width="2776" height="1562" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-923042" /><br/>
&zwnj;RCS&zwnj; is a more modern technology than SMS, and it allows for more feature parity in &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; to Android text message conversations. Many of the frustrations you might have encountered when texting someone with an Android device are resolved with &zwnj;RCS&zwnj;, such as errors sending photos and videos.<br/>
<br/>
Here's what you'll get with &zwnj;RCS&zwnj;:<br/>
<ul><br/>
 <li>Support for higher resolution photos and videos.</li><br/>
 <li>Support for larger file sizes and file sharing.</li><br/>
 <li>Audio messages.</li><br/>
 <li>Cross-platform emoji reactions.</li><br/>
 <li>Real-time typing indicators.</li><br/>
 <li>Read receipts.</li><br/>
 <li>Ability to send messages over cellular or Wi-Fi (SMS is cellular only). There is no cost to send an &zwnj;RCS&zwnj; message over Wi-Fi.</li><br/>
 <li>Improved group chats.</li><br/>
</ul><br/>
Again, &zwnj;RCS&zwnj; only comes into play when you're texting someone who has an Android device. iMessage is still the default for conversations between Apple device owners, and blue bubbles and green bubbles are not changing.<br/>
<br/>
We <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/rcs/">have a full guide on RCS</a> if you want to know more about what to expect.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="messages_via_satellite">Messages via Satellite</h2><br/>
Messages via satellite is a new feature that lets you send texts even when you don't have a Wi-Fi or cellular connection, leveraging the satellites that Apple uses for the Emergency SOS via satellite feature.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/08/ios-18-messages-via-satellite.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-960711" /><br/>
Messages via satellite is available on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-14/">iPhone 14</a> or later, and you can send and receive both iMessage and SMS messages, so you're not limited to texting with just &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; users.<br/>
<br/>
Right now, Messages via satellite is free, just like Emergency SOS via satellite. Apple offers two free years of satellite access with an &zwnj;iPhone 14&zwnj; or later, but the company has expanded free access for the &zwnj;iPhone 14&zwnj; until November 2025. Apple has not provided any insight into how much it will eventually charge for satellite access.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="smart_replies_apple_intelligence">Smart Replies (Apple Intelligence)</h2><br/>
Using Apple Intelligence, your &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; can analyze the content in a message that you've received, suggesting Smart Reply options that you can tap for a quick response.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/ios-18-1-messages-smart-reply.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-960223" /><br/>
If someone asks a question like "Do you want to go to the movies?" Messages will suggest responses like "Sure!" or "Sorry, busy tomorrow." Smart Replies aren't an option for every message that you receive, but Apple often has a suggestion.<br/>
<br/>
Smart Replies show up at the top of the keyboard, where suggestions have been in prior versions of iOS. Smart Replies are similar to suggestions, but are more intelligent and are often complete phrases and responses rather than word suggestions that pop up as you type.<br/>
<br/>
To use a Smart Reply, just tap it and it'll populate the text box so you can send it. If you don't care for the suggestion, just ignore it, and type in your own response. You'll still see suggestions once you disregard a Smart Reply.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="writing_tools_apple_intelligence">Writing Tools (Apple Intelligence)</h2><br/>
Writing Tools aren't specific to the Messages app, but are a systemwide option anywhere you can input text. In Messages, you can write out a text and then select it with a tap and drag gesture to bring up the Writing Tools interface.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/08/ios-18-messages-writing-tools.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-960712" /><br/>
Here's what Writing Tools can do for a text message:<br/>
<ul><br/>
 <li>Proofread what you've written for spelling and grammar errors, including word choice and sentence structure.</li><br/>
 <li>Rewrite with a different tone, with options that include Friendly, Professional, and Concise.</li><br/>
 <li>Summarize what you've written. You can get a quick summary, pull out key points, create a list of topics, or make a table.</li><br/>
</ul><br/>
You can tap on the various options to use the Writing Tools, and you can preview changes and decide not to use them or swap them in for what you've written.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/08/ios-18-messages-writing-tools-rewrite.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-960713" /><br/>
<h2 id="notification_summaries_apple_intelligence">Notification Summaries (Apple Intelligence)</h2><br/>
If you have multiple notifications from the Messages app, Apple Intelligence will summarize them for you so you can catch up at a glance and see what's most important without having to read through everything.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/08/ios-18-messages-summary.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-960714" /><br/>
This works for both individual conversations and group conversations, and you can see the summaries on the Lock Screen.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="emoji_design_updates">Emoji Design Updates</h2><br/>
When you send a single emoji to someone in &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj;, the emoji now appears much larger than before so the detail is easier to see. Emojis in other quantities are still displayed at the same size.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/iOS-18-Messages-Emoji.jpg" alt="" width="1179" height="921" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-955798" /><br/>
Apple has also updated the emoji picker. Emoji are displayed larger and with more space between them, plus the Sticker and Memoji interfaces have been integrated into the emoji window.<br/>
<br/>
Tapping on the two icons on the bottom left of the emoji picker will take you to Memoji and Stickers, respectively. You can create Memoji and make new stickers directly from the two sections that are in the emoji picker. For stickers, select the sticker section and tap on the blank sticker icon. For Memoji, tap into the Memoji section, tap the three dots, and then choose New, Edit, or Duplicate.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="stickers_and_memoji_as_emoji">Stickers and Memoji as Emoji</h2><br/>
Stickers and Memoji have new dedicated sections in the emoji picker because you can now use a sticker or a Memoji just like an emoji. If you add a sticker when typing a text, for example, it is added to the end of your text rather than sent as a separate image.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/ios-18-emoji-stickers-memoji.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-957882" /><br/>
You can still send a full-size sticker as long as you send it separate from text.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/08/ios-18-sticker-emoji.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-960709" /><br/>
Stickers and Memoji sent as emoji only display as emoji on devices running &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj;, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-18/">iPadOS 18</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sequoia/">macOS Sequoia</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/visionos-2/">visionOS 2</a>, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/watchos-11/">watchOS 11</a>. On earlier versions of iOS, stickers are sent as separate images as before.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="text_formatting">Text Formatting</h2><br/>
You can enhance your text messages with new formatting options. After typing something, tap on the "A" icon above the keyboard. What you've typed is selected, and you can add bold, italic, underline, or strikethrough formatting.<br/>

To add formatting to just one word, double tap on the word to select it and then tap on the "A" icon. You can also use the Text Effects option from the popup menu. Formatting can be used with emoji, but the bold and italic options don't do anything.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="text_effects">Text Effects</h2><br/>
Along with the bold, italic, underline, and strikethrough formatting, there are new animated text effects that can be applied to your entire message, a single word, a phrase, or even an emoji or sticker.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/08/ios-18-text-effects-messages.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-960710" /><br/>
Just select the text that you want to add an effect to with a double tap and then tap on the "A" icon to get to the text effects interface.<br/>
<br/>
Options include Big, Small, Shake, Nod, Explode, Ripple, Bloom, and Jitter.<br/>
<br/>
In a conversation with someone running &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj; or one of its sister updates, the text or emoji that has an effect applied to it will continually animate when viewed. These effects do not work on earlier versions of Apple's operating systems and simply don't show up.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="math_notes">Math Notes</h2><br/>
The systemwide Math Notes feature that lets your &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; solve equations for you works in Messages. To see it in action, type in an equation and you'll get an immediate answer when you add in an equals sign.<br/>
<br/>

Math Notes also works for conversions in the Messages app, including currency conversions, temperature conversions, measurement conversions, and more. You can use it by typing in your conversion, such as "20 euros to dollars" and then adding in an equals sign to get the result.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="link_card_update">Link Card Update</h2><br/>
Apple tweaked the design of link cards in the Messages app, and the cards now have colorful backgrounds that match the color of the main image in the link, if available.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/iMessage-iOS-18-Link-Cards.jpg" alt="" width="2358" height="1323" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-955800" /><br/>
You can see link card previews before a link is sent, and if you long press, you can get customization options. Link cards can be converted to a simpler card style or transformed into a text link that only shows the hyperlink with no preview at all.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="image_playground_coming_later_this_year">Image Playground (Coming Later This Year)</h2><br/>
Image Playground is an upcoming Apple Intelligence feature that is designed to let you create images using text-based prompts, much like you can do with other AI image generation platforms.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/08/ios-18-image-playground.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-960704" /><br/>
Apple is integrating Image Playground into the Messages app, so you can create and send images without having to swap over to another app. Apple Intelligence can glean the gist of your conversation from the Messages app and come up with suggestions for images that you might want to send.<br/>
<br/>
Image Playground can even incorporate images of your friends and family, so if you're chatting with a friend, you can create a silly image that uses the friend's contact photo. Apple adds a style to each image, so there is no option to generate something that could be mistaken for a real photo.<br/>
<br/>
You can choose from Animation, Illustration, and Sketch styles, and all image generation is done on-device.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="genmoji_coming_later_this_year">Genmoji (Coming Later This Year)</h2><br/>
Based on Image Playground, Genmoji lets you create custom emoji with a text prompt. Have you always wanted an emoji of a mint chocolate chip ice cream cone? It can be made with Genmoji.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/08/ios-18-genmoji.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-960703" /><br/>
Need a cat made from pizza, or a flower that's not a rose or a sunflower? Genmoji will make it possible. With the Genmoji interface, you can describe a Genmoji and Apple Intelligence will generate several options for you to choose from.<br/>
<br/>
You can even create an emoji based on the contact image of a friend or family member, similar to Image Playground.<br/>
<br/>
Genmoji behave just like emoji and can be used in place of emoji.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[The United States Department of Justice <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-sues-tiktok-and-parent-company-bytedance-widespread-violations-childrens">today sued TikTok</a> and its parent company ByteDance for violating the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). COPPA makes it illegal for websites to collect, use, and disclose data from children under the age of 13 without parental consent.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-752609" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/08/tiktok-logo.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" /><br/>
The lawsuit [<a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/media/1362606/dl?inline">PDF</a>] alleges that from 2019 on, TikTok has knowingly allowed children to create TikTok accounts and to create, view, and share videos and messages with adults and others on the TikTok platform. TikTok is accused of collecting and retaining personal information from children without consent from their parents. Data was collected even from accounts created in Kids Mode.<br/>
<br/>
Millions of children under 13 have used the regular TikTok app, which the DoJ says has subjected them to "extensive data collection" and allowed them to "interact with adult users and access adult content." TikTok is also accused of making it difficult for parents to get their child's account and data deleted.<br/>
<br/>
The Department of Justice is seeking civil penalties for every COPPA violation and injunctive relief that would prevent TikTok from continuing to collect data from children.<br/>
<br/>
TikTok is already <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/08/tiktok-sues-us-government/">embroiled in a lawsuit</a> with the U.S. government over a bill that requires the social network to be sold off to a non-Chinese company or face a ban in the United States. TikTok parent company ByteDance has until January 19, 2025 to find a buyer for TikTok, but a sale is unlikely because the Chinese government would need to approve the divestiture, and it has said that it would "firmly oppose" any effort to sell TikTok.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tiktok/">TikTok</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/02/tiktok-sued-us-justice-department/">TikTok Sued by United States Justice Department for Violating Child Privacy Laws</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/tiktok-sued-by-united-states-justice-department-for-violating-child-privacy-laws.2432795/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<title>Hands-On With Dyson&#039;s OnTrac Headphones</title>

		<description><![CDATA[Dyson recently announced <a href="https://www.dyson.com/headphones/ontrac">new OnTrac over-ear headphones</a> with ANC, and at &#36;500, OnTrac is a direct competitor for Apple's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-max/">AirPods Max</a>. Dyson smartly did away with the unpopular air purifying mask design that it used for its prior-generation headphones, and the new model boasts a more traditional look with exceptional battery life.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7TauZG-qR10" title="Dyson Made Headphones Again...but these are GOOD!? | Dyson OnTrac Review" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/macrumors?sub_confirmation=1">Subscribe to the MacRumors YouTube channel</a> for more videos.</em></div><br/>
Dyson's OnTrac headphones come in four metallic colorways, including CNC Aluminium, Copper, Ceramic Cinnabar (with a ceramic-feel painted finish), and Black Nickel, plus there are interchangeable ear caps and cushions in a range of colors for customization.<br/>
<br/>
The headphones have "high-grade foam cushions" covered in microsuede, and multi-pivot gimbal arms that are meant to relieve ear pressure. There's also a headband with a battery inside, which Dyson says evenly distributes weight. With the metal build and the multiple batteries that Dyson has included, the headphones weigh 451 grams, making them heavier than the &zwnj;AirPods Max&zwnj; (385 grams).<br/>
<br/>
The &zwnj;AirPods Max&zwnj; are too heavy for some users, and weight has been a complaint. With the OnTrac, weight is indeed well distributed and not all in the ear cups like the &zwnj;AirPods Max&zwnj;, but we found that they still get uncomfortable over time, so for many people, they likely won't be ideal for all-day use. For comparison, Sonos recently came out with the Ace headphones that weigh 312 grams, and they're more comfortable than both the &zwnj;AirPods Max&zwnj; and the OnTrac.<br/>
<br/>
In terms of design, these are not subtle headphones, and you're going to stand out when wearing them. The OnTrac headphones are huge, but well-built and sturdy. The left ear cup has a power button and USB-C charging port, while the right ear cup has a joystick for music playback and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a> activation when used with an Apple device.<br/>
<br/>
Dyson focused on battery life with the OnTrac. With Active Noise Cancellation turned on, the headphones last for up to 55 hours, more than double the battery life of the &zwnj;AirPods Max&zwnj; (20 hours with ANC). Dyson could have cut some weight with less battery capacity, but if you're off grid and need headphones that are going to last for a good three days with heavy listening, the OnTrac has you covered.<br/>
<br/>
Dyson says the headphones have 40mm, 16-ohm neodymium speaker drivers and advanced audio signal processing with sub-bass you can feel. While the sound quality was good, the OnTrac is not notably better than the &zwnj;AirPods Max&zwnj; or the Sonos Ace. Active Noise Cancellation and transparency are both solid, and the OnTrac does a good job cutting out ambient noise. Dyson says they can reduce noise by up to 40 decibels.<br/>
<br/>
You can adjust the ANC and sound through the app, so there is some customizability, but you are limited to three EQ levels, enhanced, bass boost, and neutral. On-ear detection is available for pausing music when removing the OnTrac, but these are Bluetooth headphones and don't work as seamlessly as the &zwnj;AirPods Max&zwnj; with Apple devices.<br/>
<br/>
Dyson plans to start selling the OnTrac headphones on August 12, and they will be <a href="https://www.dyson.com/headphones/ontrac">available from the Dyson website</a>.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today issued an apology to Thailand for the way the country was portrayed in a July "The Underdogs" short film, and the video has also been removed from Apple's YouTube channel. In the ad that was <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/18/apple-shares-underdogs-video-vision-pro/">released on July 18</a>, the underdogs design team traveled to Bangkok and Rayong, Thailand for a project and were depicted traveling in a tuk-tuk and staying in a rundown hotel.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/underdogs-video.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="720" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-959216" /><br/>
Thai residents found the depiction of Thailand offensive, and took to social media to criticize Apple for portraying the country with outdated stereotypes. The video made Thailand look "low-tech and underdeveloped" due to the faded, sepia tone and focus on dilapidated architecture, according to the Bangkok Post.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Apple’s latest short film commercial &#39;The Underdogs: OOO (Out Of Office)&#39; that aims to represent its gadgets filmed in Thailand has sparked criticism among Thai people as the commercial portrays Thailand in a low-tech and underdeveloped mood and tone, using a warm colour in… <a href="https://t.co/yYgAXCDFUd">pic.twitter.com/yYgAXCDFUd</a></p>&mdash; Bangkok Post (@BangkokPostNews) <a href="https://twitter.com/BangkokPostNews/status/1816768894218260808?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 26, 2024</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div><br/>
Thai House of Representatives Committee on Tourism spokesperson Sattra Sripan called for a boycott on Apple over the video. "Thai people are deeply unhappy with the advertisement," he said. "I encourage Thai people to stop using Apple products and change to other brands." He said that the tourism committee planned to invite Apple representatives and state agencies to discuss the ad.<br/>
<br/>
Apple in a statement to <em><a href="https://www.bangkokpost.com/life/tech/2840337/apple-apologises-and-removes-controversial-ad">Bangkok Post</a></em> this morning said that it was sorry that Thailand was inaccurately portrayed, and confirmed that the ad had been taken down.<br/>
<blockquote>Our intent was to celebrate the country's optimism and culture, and we apologize for not fully capturing the vibrancy of Thailand today.</blockquote><br/>
Apple worked with Thailand-based film production studio Indochina Productions on the video, and it was shot entirely in Thailand. Since 2019, Apple has released several videos that star the underdogs as part of an "Apple at Work" ad campaign.<br/>
<br/>
This is the second ad that Apple has pulled this year. When the M4 <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a> models came out in May, Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/10/apple-crush-ad-apology/">showed a video</a> of a hydraulic press crushing an array of creative tools, which was not well received by creatives. Apple pulled the video, apologized, and said that it had "missed the mark" with the ad.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-ads/">Apple Ads</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/thailand/">Thailand</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/02/apple-pulls-latest-underdogs-ad/">Apple Pulls Latest Ad After Criticism Over Depiction of Thailand</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-pulls-latest-ad-after-criticism-over-depiction-of-thailand.2432788/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple CEO Tim Cook on Thursday said that ChatGPT will be integrated across iOS 18, iPadOS 18, and macOS Sequoia "by the end of the calendar year." He shared this timeframe during <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/01/apple-q3-2024-earnings-takeaways/">Apple's quarterly earnings call</a> with analysts.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/08/iOS-18-ChatGPT.jpg" alt="" width="1825" height="1027" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-960667" /><br/>
Apple first said that ChatGPT integration was coming to the iPhone, iPad, and Mac later this year during its WWDC keynote in June, and Cook's comment indicates that this timeframe remains on track as of the first week of August.<br/>
<br/>
"ChatGPT is integrated by the end of the calendar year," said Cook, in response to a question about the timing of Apple Intelligence features.<br/>
<br/>
With user permission, Siri will be able to show ChatGPT answers directly in response to questions and other prompts. ChatGPT will also be an option for Apple's system-wide Writing Tools feature, allowing users to generate text and images. Apple said ChatGPT will be powered by OpenAI's latest GPT-4o model on its platforms.<br/>
<br/>
iPhone, iPad, and Mac users will be able to use ChatGPT for free, without creating an account, and ChatGPT Plus subscribers will be able to connect their accounts to access paid features on these devices. Apple said OpenAI will not store ChatGPT requests made from its devices, and  it said users' IP addresses will be obscured.<br/>
<br/>
Apple Intelligence features started rolling out to developers for testing <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/29/ios-18-1-apple-intelligence-features/">in the iOS 18.1 beta</a> earlier this week, but ChatGPT integration is not available yet.<br/>
<br/>
Apple Intelligence features require an iPhone 15 Pro or iPhone 15 Pro Max, or a Mac or iPad equipped with an M1 chip or newer. The device's language must be set to U.S. English, with support for additional languages to roll out over the next year. <br/>
<br/>
The full suite of Apple Intelligence features is expected to be available <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/09/ios-18-4-apple-intelligence-powered-siri/">by time iOS 18.4 is released</a> to the public around March 2025. These features will enable users to summarize text, prioritize notifications and emails, generate custom emoji and images, and more. The technology will also power a smarter version of Siri with richer language understanding, deeper per-app controls, on-screen awareness, and personalized context.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-18/">iPadOS 18</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/chatgpt/">ChatGPT</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-18.244">iOS 18</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-18.245">iPadOS 18</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/02/ios-18-chatgpt-later-this-year/">Apple Says iOS 18&#039;s ChatGPT Integration on Track for Later This Year</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-says-ios-18s-chatgpt-integration-on-track-for-later-this-year.2432780/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[On this week's episode of <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/apple-intelligence-beta-is-here/id1602394741?i=1000664139205">The MacRumors Show</a>, we discuss Apple's unusual iOS 18.1, iPadOS 18.1, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sequoia/">macOS Sequoia</a> 15.1 betas that <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/29/apple-releases-ios-18-1-apple-intelligence/">introduce Apple Intelligence</a> for the first time.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6Ha8HZAVkNU?si=kMFfyntryyFlid0-" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@themacrumorsshow?sub_confirmation=1">Subscribe to The MacRumors Show YouTube channel</a> for more videos</em></div><br/>
The beta versions currently available are exclusive to developers, providing them with a first <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/30/apple-intelligence-hands-on/">hands-on look at Apple Intelligence</a>. Apple continues to beta test <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-18/">iPadOS 18</a>, and &zwnj;macOS Sequoia&zwnj; 15 separately.<br/>
<br/>
One of the most prominent aspects of Apple Intelligence is its Writing Tools, which allow users to proofread text for spelling and grammar errors and rewrite content to change its tone. Users can also summarize any text, creating paragraphs, lists, or tables, which are accessible anywhere text input is possible across the operating system.<br/>
<br/>
The revamped version of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a> is another key feature of Apple Intelligence. The voice assistant now boasts a new design with a glowing edge around the display when activated, indicating when &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; is listening. There is also a Type to &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; option, which allows users to interact with &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; via text instead of voice commands. &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; has been enhanced to maintain context between requests and follow along if the user stumbles over words. Additionally, &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; can now answer a wide range of questions about Apple devices, leveraging Apple's extensive product knowledge and support database.<br/>
<br/>
Several other features included in the beta release are designed to improve communication and media management. For example, users can record, transcribe, and summarize phone calls, which are then stored in the Notes app. The Mail and Messages applications now feature Smart Replies, offering quick, context-based responses. In the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/photos/">Photos</a> app, the new Memory Maker feature allows users to create memory movies from photo collections using natural language descriptions. This feature automatically selects relevant photos and music, although users can customize their creations further.<br/>
<br/>
Some features have been postponed to later releases. The Image Playground app, which offers image creation tools, is not yet available. Genmoji, a tool for creating custom emojis, and the Image Wand feature, which inserts contextually relevant images into Notes, are also missing from the current beta. Additionally, Priority Notifications, which prioritize important alerts, and advanced Mail categories for sorting incoming messages are not yet implemented. Other postponed features include the ability to remove unwanted objects from photos with a single tap, enhanced &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; capabilities such as on-screen awareness, and ChatGPT integration, which should significantly expand &zwnj;Siri&zwnj;'s conversational abilities.<br/>
<br/>
Apple has indicated that these additional features will be rolled out progressively throughout 2024 and 2025. The current Apple Intelligence beta is limited to U.S. English and is not accessible to developers in the European Union or China. Apple Intelligence is supported by the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a> and &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; Max, all Apple silicon iPads, and all Apple silicon Macs. The public will have access to the first Apple Intelligence features upon the official release of iOS 18.1, iPadOS 18.1, and &zwnj;macOS Sequoia&zwnj; 15.1 later this year.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[All four iPhone 17 models expected to launch next year will feature an upgraded 24-megapixel front-facing camera, according to Apple analyst Jeff Pu.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/08/iPhone-17-Slim-Feature-Single-Camera-2.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-960528" /><br/>
In a research note today for investment bank Haitong, obtained by <em>MacRumors</em>, Pu shared a chart indicating that the iPhone 17, the tentatively-named <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/24/kuo-ultra-thin-iphone-17-specs/">iPhone 17 Slim</a>, the iPhone 17 Pro, and the iPhone 17 Pro Max will each be equipped with a 24-megapixel front camera with six plastic lens elements. By comparison, all iPhone 15 models are equipped with a 12-megapixel front camera with five plastic lens elements.<br/>
<br/>
Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo also claimed that at least one iPhone 17 model <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/04/kuo-iphone-17-to-feature-24mp-front-facing-camera/">would be equipped with a 24-megapixel front camera</a> with a six-piece lens back in January, so this upgrade has now been rumored by multiple sources, making it more likely. Kuo said these changes will "significantly improve the image quality."<br/>
<br/>
With a higher 24-megapixel resolution, photos can maintain their quality even when cropped to a greater degree, providing more flexibility in post-processing. A six-piece lens would also slightly enhance image quality, as each element is designed to correct for various aberrations and distortions, leading to clearer, more accurate photos.<br/>
<br/>
iPhone 17 models are expected to launch in September 2025, so they are still over a year away. Rumors about the two-generations-away iPhones always begin quite early, as Apple develops and prototypes products well before they are released.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17/">iPhone 17</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/jeff-pu/">Jeff Pu</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/02/iphone-17-24mp-front-camera-rumor/">All iPhone 17 Models Again Rumored to Feature 24MP Front Camera</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/all-iphone-17-models-again-rumored-to-feature-24mp-front-camera.2432762/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<title>Apple&#039;s First Foldable iPad Could Face Delays Into 2026</title>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's first foldable device may not hit its previously expected 2025 schedule for mass production, based on new comments made by Haitong analyst Jeff Pu.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/10/Foldable-iPhone-2023-Feature-Blue.jpg" alt="" width="1458" height="820" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-797663" /><br/>
In a note to investors seen by <em>MacRumors</em>, Pu said that he continued to expect enhanced Apple product power driven by the likes of the iPhone 17 and Apple Intelligence, but this came despite some "pushouts" seen for Apple's foldable iPad.<br/>
<br/>
When investors or analysts use the term "pushout" in relation to product releases, they typically mean the expected release date has been moved further into the future, either because there's a delay in the development or manufacturing process, or the company has decided to postpone the launch for other reasons.<br/>
<br/>
In a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/06/first-apple-foldable-coming-in-2025/">May report</a>, Pu said Apple's first foldable devices would reach mass production in 2025 and 2026, following increasing evidence of foldable devices in Apple's supply chain. At the time, the analyst said Apple would likely release a large-screen foldable iPad or MacBook in that timeframe before launching a higher-volume foldable iPhone in late 2026.<br/>
<br/>
Pu had said one Apple foldable with a 20.3-inch display would start production in late 2025, which was sooner than previously expected. However, Pu now thinks Apple will join the foldable market in the second quarter of 2026 due to "display durability issues."<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/jeff-pu/">Jeff Pu</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/foldable-ipad/">Foldable iPad</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/02/apple-foldable-ipad-delays/">Apple&#039;s First Foldable iPad Could Face Delays Into 2026</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apples-first-foldable-ipad-could-face-delays-into-2026.2432754/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple is putting pressure on Tencent and ByteDance to make significant changes to two of China's most popular apps in order to remove loopholes that circumvent Apple's typical 30% commission, <em><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-08-02/apple-pressures-tencent-and-bytedance-over-app-fees-in-china">Bloomberg</a></em> reports.<br/>

The loopholes are linked to mini-apps that allow users of Tencent's social-messaging app WeChat and ByteDance's short-video app Douyin to play games, hail taxis, and make online purchases without leaving the app.<br/>
<br/>
Apple reportedly told both companies they need to prevent mini-app creators from including links to outside payment systems that circumvent its commission system. Apple said it would not approve future updates to WeChat or Douyin until the companies complied. <br/>
<br/>
Apple also has asked Tencent to disable in-game chats between developers and users, because they can also be used to send links, according to <em>Bloomberg</em>. Tencent has reportedly pushed back against the idea due to the negative impact it would have on the game experience.<br/>
<br/>
The report characterized the moves by Apple as "unusually aggressive" in China, suggesting they may inflame tensions at a time when its business practices are under scrutiny by antitrust regulators around the world. <br/>
<br/>
An Apple spokesperson who contacted <em>Bloomberg</em> cited its guidelines that the sale of all digital goods must go through its system, and that its review team may reject app submissions that violate that policy.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/china/">China</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/02/apple-pressures-bytedance-tencent-app-fees/">Apple Pressures ByteDance and Tencent Over App Fee Loopholes in China</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-pressures-bytedance-and-tencent-over-app-fee-loopholes-in-china.2432751/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<title>Wallet App Support for Apple Account Cards Now Live in Australia and Canada</title>

		<description><![CDATA[Support for Apple Account Cards in the Wallet app has gone live in Canada and Australia, over two years since it first launched in the United States.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/05/apple-account-card-feature.jpg" alt="" width="2048" height="1152" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-846914" /><br/>
The change means users can use the Wallet app to add an Apple Account Card, which displays the Apple credit balance associated with an Apple ID. If you receive an App Store or Apple Store gift card, for example, it is added to an Apple Account that was previously visible in the ‌App Store‌ and ‌Apple Store‌ apps. <br/>
<br/>
Support for the feature in Canada and Australia requires iPhone users updating to iOS 17.6, as spotted by <a href="https://x.com/nicolas09f9/status/1819173249973997699?s=46">Nicolás Álvarez</a>. Prior to today, support for the feature was thought to be limited to Japan and the US.<br/>
<br/>
To add an Apple Account Card, open up the Wallet app and under "Available Cards," tap on "Add Apple Account." As long as you have an Apple Account balance, you'll be able to add the card.<br/>
<br/>
Once added, you can view your Apple Account balance right from the Wallet app and use it to purchase Apple products, apps, games, and music. It works in the same way as any other card in the Wallet app when at an ‌Apple Store‌. The Apple Account Card replaces the iTunes Pass that used to be available a long time ago.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/australia/">Australia</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/canada/">Canada</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/02/apple-account-cards-canada-australia/">Wallet App Support for Apple Account Cards Now Live in Australia and Canada</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/wallet-app-support-for-apple-account-cards-now-live-in-australia-and-canada.2432748/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max are rumored to feature bigger battery capacities compared to previous-generation models, but it looks like the smaller iPhone 16 Pro device could see the biggest improvement, according to new details.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/iPhone-16-Pro-Front-Update-Blue.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-953750" /><br/>
Chinese Weibo-based leaker <a href="https://weibo.com/5143897135/Oqjg7Flks">Instant Digital</a> today posted the mAh (milliampere-hours) figures for the iPhone 16 Pro (3,577 mAh) and iPhone 16 Pro Max (4,676 mAh), with only the larger model capacity lining up with previous leaked figures.<br/>
<br/>
The mAh is a measure of battery capacity, or the amount of electric charge that a battery can store. The higher the mAh rating of a battery, the more charge it can hold, and the longer it can power a device. The following table shows the battery capacity comparison between the iPhone 15 Pro models and iPhone 16 Pro models.<br/>
<br/>
<table class="comparison"><br/>
 <tr><br/>
 <th></th><br/>
 <th>iPhone 15 Pros (2023)</th><br/>
 <th>iPhone 16 Pros (2024)</th><br/>
 <th>% Change</th><br/>
 </tr><br/>
<tr><br/>
 <th>Pro</th><br/>
 <td>3,274 mAh</td><br/>
 <td>3,577 mAh</td><br/>
 <td>+9.25%</td><br/>
 </tr><br/>
 <tr><br/>
 <th>Max</th><br/>
 <td>4,422 mAh</td><br/>
 <td>4,676 mAh</td><br/>
 <td>+5.74%</td><br/>
 </tr><br/>
</table><br/>
<div class="clear"></div>The change in capacity of the iPhone 16 Pro over the previous Pro model shows the most marked difference, with an over 9% increase (303 mAh). Meanwhile, the iPhone 16 Pro Max, while not as dramatic as its smaller sibling, gets an over 5% increase (254 mAh). Combined with efficiency improvements, the increases should see both devices offer more sustained real-world usage on a single charge.<br/>
<br/>
According to one <a href="https://m.blog.naver.com/PostView.naver?blogId=yeux1122&logNo=223409700148&navType=by">rumor</a>, this year's ‌iPhone 16 Pro‌ Max will boast a 30-hour-plus battery life (compared to 29 hours for the iPhone 15 Pro Max). Not only that, the iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max are expected to use <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/07/17/iphone-15-could-feature-stacked-battery-technology/">stacked battery technology</a> for increased energy density and prolonged lifespan. <br/>

Both devices are also rumored to support <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/10/iphone-16-pro-40w-fast-charging-20w-magsafe/">40W wired fast charging and 20W MagSafe charging</a>. For comparison, iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Pro models are capable of up to 27W peak charging speeds with an appropriate USB-C power adapter, while official MagSafe chargers from Apple and authorized third parties can wirelessly charge the iPhone 15 models at up to 15W. <div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/">iPhone 16 Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/instant-digital/">Instant Digital</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/02/iphone-16-pro-battery-capacities/">iPhone 16 Pro Model to Get Biggest Battery Capacity Jump</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-16-pro-model-to-get-biggest-battery-capacity-jump.2432744/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>
