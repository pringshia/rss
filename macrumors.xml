		<description><![CDATA[Last month, Microsoft <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/20/microsoft-ai-windows-pcs/">announced the upcoming launch</a> of Copilot+ Windows PCs with integrated AI hardware and software. One feature that Microsoft touted was Recall, a tool that's designed to take regular snapshots of PC content to help users find anything they've seen or done on their machine.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/maC9iZMaAlM" title="Recall instantly with Recall on Copilot+ PC" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><br/>
As it turns out, Recall might be a security nightmare for Windows users. Security expert Kevin Beaumont <a href="https://doublepulsar.com/recall-stealing-everything-youve-ever-typed-or-viewed-on-your-own-windows-pc-is-now-possible-da3e12e9465e">recently said</a> (via <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/3/24170305/microsoft-windows-recall-ai-screenshots-security-privacy-issues">The Verge</a></em>) that he was able to automate a program that provides plain text data of everything a user has viewed, despite Microsoft's claims that Recall information cannot be exfiltrated remotely.<br/>
<br/>
Beaumont claims that Recall is "essentially an infostealer" that's included in Windows by default, and that it will "set cybersecurity back a decade by empowering cybercriminals." With Recall, hackers are able to scrape "everything you've ever looked at within seconds," and users should prepare for "AI powered super breaches."<br/>
<br/>
Microsoft describes Recall as a feature that lets you "search across time to find the content you need." Powered by AI, Recall takes snapshots every five seconds when content on the screen is different from the prior snapshot and stores the snapshots in a timeline, with AI software using OCR to make the text in the snapshots searchable. Microsoft says that snapshots are locally stored and are analyzed on-device, which should make them secure, but the OCR data is stored in an SQLite database that could be accessed by hackers who infiltrate a PC using malware.<br/>
<br/>
According to Beaumont, infostealer trojans are able to be "easily modified to support Recall" and data from the feature can be accessed remotely. Microsoft "tried to do a bunch of things" to improve security, but ultimately, "none of it actually works properly in the real world." The database that is theoretically accessible by malicious actors contains everything a user has seen such as text messages and passwords, every user interaction, and all websites visited (with the exception of Microsoft Edge in Private Mode).<br/>
<br/>
Beaumont has not shared full technical details on how he automated exfiltration of the Recall database, and is holding until Recall is shipped because he wants to give Microsoft "time to do something." Beaumont recommends that Microsoft pull the feature for the time being.<br/>
<br/>
Copilot+ PCs with Recall are set to launch on June 18. As of now, Recall is turned on by default, though users can optionally disable it.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/microsoft/">Microsoft</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/03/windows-11-recall-feature-disaster/">Security Researcher Calls Windows 11 AI &#039;Recall&#039; Screenshotting Feature a Disaster</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/security-researcher-calls-windows-11-ai-recall-screenshotting-feature-a-disaster.2428084/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Spotify <a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2024-06-03/adjusting-spotify-premium-prices-in-the-us/">today announced</a> that it is increasing Premium plan pricing in the United States in order to "bring users the best experience."<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/08/General-Spotify-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1407" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-810756" /><br/>
The Individual Premium plan is now priced at &#36;11.99, up from &#36;10.99. Duo is priced at &#36;16.99 (up &#36;2), Family is priced at &#36;19.99 (up &#36;3), and Student is priced at &#36;5.99 (no change).<br/>
<br/>
This is actually the second time <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/07/24/spotify-increases-premium-plan-price/">Spotify has raised prices</a> in the last 12 months. In July 2023, the Premium plan price went from &#36;9.99 to &#36;10.99, so there has been a 20 percent increase in the last year. Prior to the July 2023 increase, Duo was priced at &#36;12.99 and the Family plan was priced at &#36;15.99, marking a 31 percent total increase for Duo and a 25 percent increase for Family after the 2024 price hikes.<br/>
<br/>
Spotify subscribers will soon be seeing emails notifying them of the upcoming price increase. Emails will include instructions on how to cancel a Premium subscription.<br/>
<blockquote>On Spotify, users discover and enjoy music, podcasts, and audiobooks. So that we can continue to invest in and innovate on our product features and bring users the best experience, we occasionally update our prices. Over the next month, subscribers in the U.S. will receive an email explaining what this update means for their subscription.</blockquote><br/>
At &#36;11.99 and &#36;19.99, respectively, the Spotify Premium and Family plans are now more expensive than the equivalent <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/">Apple Music</a> plans. Apple's Individual plan is priced at &#36;10.99 per month, while the Family plan is priced at &#36;16.99 per month.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/spotify/">Spotify</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/03/spotify-price-increase/">Spotify Raises Prices for Second Time in 12 Months, Now More Expensive Than Apple Music</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/spotify-raises-prices-for-second-time-in-12-months-now-more-expensive-than-apple-music.2428081/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Though Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/03/apple-says-m2-ipad-air-9-gpu-cores-not-10/">mistakenly listed</a> the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m2/">M2</a> chip in the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/">iPad Air</a> as having a 10-core GPU instead of a 9-core GPU, the performance claims that it shared during the &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; launch and in marketing materials are accurate.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/m2-iPad-Air-Horizontal-Feature-Orange.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-950736" /><br/>
In a statement provided to <em><a href="https://9to5mac.com/2024/06/03/apple-says-m2-ipad-air-performance-claims-are-accurate-despite-gpu-mix-up/">9to5Mac</a></em>, Apple said that the details it shared on the &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj;'s performance were always based on a 9-core GPU.<br/>
<blockquote>We are updating Apple.com to correct the core count for the M2 iPad Air. All performance claims for the M2 iPad Air are accurate and based on a 9-core GPU.</blockquote><br/>
Apple's website says that the &zwnj;M2&zwnj; chip is "nearly 50 percent faster than the previous generation," and that it specifically has "25 percent faster graphics."<br/>
<br/>
Apple recently updated its technical specifications website for the &zwnj;M2&zwnj; &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; to state that the device has a 9-core GPU. Prior to the update, it listed a 10-core GPU. The prior-generation <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a> had a 10-core GPU, so it is a surprise that the &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; version is limited to a 9-core GPU.<br/>
<br/>
Other &zwnj;M2&zwnj; chip specifications have not changed. The &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; has an 8-core CPU with four performance cores and four efficiency cores, along with 8GB RAM and a 16-core Neural Engine.<br/>
<br/>
Because it took Apple several days to correct the chip error on its website, some users may have purchased the &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; believing it had a 10-core GPU. The two week return period has expired for those who bought on launch day, but customers would have a good argument for a return exception.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/">iPad Air </a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPad-Air">iPad Air (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipad.137">iPad</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/03/ipad-air-performance-accurate-gpu-error/">Apple Says iPad Air Performance Details Are Accurate Despite 9-Core GPU Mistake</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-says-ipad-air-performance-details-are-accurate-despite-9-core-gpu-mistake.2428070/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

These deals are available to all shoppers and you don't need to be a Verizon customer to get the discounts.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
You can get the 64GB Apple TV 4K for <a href="https://www.dpbolvw.net/click-462641-14066852?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.verizon.com%2Fproducts%2Fapple-tv-4k-wifi-with-64-gb-storage%2F%3Fsku%3Dsku5710030"><strong>&#36;89.99</strong></a> in this sale, down from &#36;129.99, which is a new all-time low price. We haven't tracked any notable deals on the 2022 A15 Apple TV 4K in nearly a year, much less one as low as Verizon's sale.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://www.dpbolvw.net/click-462641-14066852?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.verizon.com%2Fproducts%2Fapple-tv-4k-wifi-with-64-gb-storage%2F%3Fsku%3Dsku5710030"target="_blank"><div class="fancybutton"><div class="fancybadge">&#36;40 OFF</div>Apple TV 4K (64GB) for &#36;89.99</div></a></div><br/>

Secondly, Verizon has the second generation HomePod for <a href="https://www.dpbolvw.net/click-462641-14066852?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.verizon.com%2Fproducts%2Fapple-homepod%2F"><strong>&#36;174.99</strong></a>, down from &#36;299.99. This is a massive &#36;125 discount on the 2023 smart speaker, beating the traditional discounted price by nearly &#36;100. This one is only available in Midnight.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/new-homepod-blue.jpg" alt="" width="2250" height="1266" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-953293" /><div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://www.dpbolvw.net/click-462641-14066852?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.verizon.com%2Fproducts%2Fapple-homepod%2F"target="_blank"><div class="fancybutton"><div class="fancybadge">&#36;125 OFF</div>HomePod (2nd Gen) for &#36;174.99</div></a></div><br/>
<br/>
Lastly, the carrier has a few buy one, get one half off deals going on right now on both <a href="https://www.kqzyfj.com/click-462641-11557999?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.verizon.com%2Fonesearch%2Fsearch%3Fq%3Dairpods%26ES%3Dshop%26src%3Dwireless">AirPods</a> and <a href="https://www.dpbolvw.net/click-462641-14066852?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.verizon.com%2Fproducts%2Fapple-homepod-mini%2F%3Fsku%3Dsku4240002">HomePod mini</a>.

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today released a new version of iPadOS 17.5.1, specifically for the 10th-generation low-cost <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>. The update is a second version of iPadOS 17.5.1, with a version number of 21F91, up from the original 21F90 version.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-951676" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/iOS-17.5.1-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" /><br/>
The iPadOS 17.5.1 update can be downloaded through Finder or iTunes, and it does not appear to be over-the-air as of yet. &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; 10 owners who already installed iPadOS 17.5.1 may not see the update, and it may be limited to those who have not yet downloaded the software.<br/>
<br/>
There is no word on why Apple has released a new version of iPadOS 17.5.1 for the 10th-generation &zwnj;iPad&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
iOS 17.5.1 and iPadOS 17.5.1 previously came out on Monday, May 20, and included a fix for a bug that could cause images to reappear in the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/photos/">Photos</a> app even after being deleted.

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today updated its Apple Developer app in preparation for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/wwdc/">WWDC 2024</a>, which is set to begin next Monday with a keynote event at 10:00 a.m. Pacific Time.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-795934" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/04/apple-developer-app-feature.jpg" alt="" width="2250" height="1266" /><br/>
The updated version of the Developer app will host 2024 session videos, 1-on-1 labs with Apple engineers and designers, and more. Apple plans to stream the WWDC keynote event in the Apple Developer app, as well as the Platforms State of the Union and other developer sessions that are set to come out throughout the week.<br/>
<br/>
With the refreshed Developer app, Apple has added related videos and an option to quickly view full-screen videos on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> when it's held in landscape mode, along with bug fixes. Apple's release notes:<blockquote>New in this release:<br/>
- Explore all WWDC24 has to offer, including video sessions, consultations, and more.<br/>
- When a video ends, you'll see a related video to play next.<br/>
- When viewing a video in landscape orientation on iPhone, you can tap its thumbnail to present it full-screen.<br/>
- We've fixed bugs and added various other enhancements.</blockquote>With every pre-WWDC update, Apple introduces new stickers, and this year there are nine sticker options that have been included. The stickers, many of which are animated, can be used in iMessage, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/facetime/">FaceTime</a>, and other apps. Stickers include animated emoji characters, an Apple logo, a Vision Pro, and static dogcow and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-park/">Apple Park</a> options.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/wwdec24-stickers.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-953281" /><br/>
&zwnj;WWDC 2024&zwnj; will focus on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a>, iPadOS 18, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-15/">macOS 15</a>, and more, with no hardware expected this year.<br/>
<br/>
Developers can use the WWDC app to access all of what Apple has to offer. Since 2020, the bulk of the WWDC event has been online, with all developers able to view sessions and engage with Apple employees. A select number of developers have also been invited to &zwnj;Apple Park&zwnj; for a viewing event.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-card/">Apple Card</a> holders can get extra Daily Cash back when making purchases at Ace Hardware during the month of June, according to a new email Apple started sending out today.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/ace-hardware-apple-card-promotion.jpg" alt="" width="1328" height="747" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-953269" /><br/>
From now until June 30, &zwnj;Apple Card&zwnj; users who make a purchase at Ace Hardware can earn six percent cash back instead of the standard three percent cash back. Getting the extra cash requires Ace customers to use <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-pay/">Apple Pay</a> with the &zwnj;Apple Card&zwnj; specifically, and the promotion is limited to up to &#36;500 in purchases.<br/>
<br/>
&zwnj;Apple Card&zwnj; owners who spend &#36;500 at Ace Hardware will earn a total of &#36;30 in Daily Cash during the month. Purchases can be made at participating Ace Hardware stores, the Ace Hardware website, and the Ace mobile app.<br/>
<br/>
Apple partners with several retailers to offer three percent Daily Cash back on ‌‌&zwnj;Apple Pay&zwnj;‌‌ purchases made with ‌‌&zwnj;Apple Card&zwnj;‌‌, including Ace Hardware. Three percent cash back can also be earned from Panera Bread, T-Mobile, Nike, Uber Eats, Uber, Panera, Walgreens, Exxon Mobil, and Apple's own retail stores.<br/>
<br/>
Standard ‌‌&zwnj;Apple Pay&zwnj;‌‌ purchases earn two percent cash back, and all other purchases earn one percent.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-pay-promo/">Apple Pay Promo</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-card/">Apple Card</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/daily-cash/">Daily Cash</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/03/ace-hardware-apple-card-promo/">Get 6% Cash Back at Ace Hardware With Latest Apple Card Promotion</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/get-6-cash-back-at-ace-hardware-with-latest-apple-card-promotion.2428050/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today shared a trio of humorous Mac ads that focus on the battery life, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/find-my-network-accessory-program/">Find My</a>, and the performance capabilities of Apple silicon notebooks. The "Charged" ad, for example, shows a serious professor commenting on a student's remaining battery life.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe title="Mac Charged Apple" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZpLYP-JHg9A" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div><br/>
"First class of the day and no charger? You're playing a dangerous game..." he says, but the student says that she doesn't have to worry about it because the Mac's battery lasts all day.<br/>
<br/>
In "Powered," a student in a library is approached by a woman who says that laptops aren't meant to handle big files and multiple apps. "You think it won't crash?" she says. "You're a hot dog in a hurricane." The student lets her know that "it's a Mac," so it's "running fine."<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe title="Mac Powered Apple" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Vb4jrtDzFhE" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div><br/>
The "Found" ad features a student looking for her laptop. "Yeah, computers have a funny way of vanishing around here..." says a man nearby. The student uses &zwnj;Find My&zwnj; to ping her laptop and is able to locate it while he's still going on about how computers are often sold for parts. <br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UeE4l2MlWMo" title="Mac | Found | Apple" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><br/>
All three videos have a dramatic, funny vibe that should play well on social networks. The ads are 38 seconds long, so they'll likely be shown on TikTok, Instagram, and other social networks.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-ads/">Apple Ads</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/03/mac-ads-apple-silicon-battery-life/">Humorous Apple Ads Highlight MacBook&#039;s Power and Battery Life</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/humorous-apple-ads-highlight-macbooks-power-and-battery-life.2428045/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple is unlikely to release a foldable <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> before 2027, but it could significantly disrupt the market when it launches, according to Taiwanese research firm <a href="https://www.trendforce.com/presscenter/news/20240603-12170.html">TrendForce</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/05/Foldable-iPhone-2023-Feature-Yellow.jpg" alt="" width="1458" height="820" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-797652" /><br/>
The report highlights that foldable phones currently represent a mere 1.5% of the smartphone market, with projections suggesting an increase to 4.8% by 2028. Apple is apparently "still evaluating component specifications and performance, with strict requirements for crease and reliability." Screen creasing is an issue that plagues many current foldable devices, raising concerns about long-term durability and the risk of screen damage from debris. <br/>
<br/>
Despite the emergence of a range of popular foldable devices from the likes of Samsung, Huawei, Motorola, and Nubia, Apple's delayed entry to the foldable space is not necessarily a disadvantage. The company's significant market influence and established customer base mean that a foldable &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; could quickly gain popularity upon release. As a result, analysts believe that Apple's entry into the foldable phone space could "significantly shift market dynamics."<br/>
<br/>
Apple is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/06/first-apple-foldable-coming-in-2025/">widely expected</a> to release a large-screen foldable <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> or MacBook to kick-off its foray into the product category before launching a higher volume foldable &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/trendforce/">TrendForce</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/foldable-iphone/">Foldable iPhone</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/03/foldable-iphone-unlikely-to-launch-before-2027/">Foldable iPhone Unlikely to Launch Before 2027</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/foldable-iphone-unlikely-to-launch-before-2027.2428044/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[In a social media post last week, <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman said iOS 18 will include <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/31/ios-18-control-center-updates-rumor/">"updates" to Control Center</a>, and he has now outlined a few specific changes.<br/>
<br/>

However, he did not provide any further details about these changes, so all we know for now is these will apparently be two focus areas for Apple.<br/>
<br/>
Apple will unveil iOS 18 during its <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/28/wwdc-2024-full-schedule/">WWDC keynote on June 10</a>, and the first beta should be made available to members of the Apple Developer Program immediately following the presentation.

		<title>Apple Vision Pro Mindfulness App May Get &#039;Respiration Tracking&#039; Feature</title>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple is working on a new "respiration tracking" feature for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a> that is likely to be functional during mindfulness sessions, based on backend code discovered by <em>MacRumors</em>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/mindfulness-vision-pro.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-953177" /><br/>
Contributor Aaron Perris found references to the previously unheard-of feature in lines of code related to the headset's Mindfulness app, which offers users an immersive meditation experience using either guided meditations or self-guided sessions.<br/>
<br/>
Apple's Mindfulness app essentially encourages the user to cultivate awareness of their own breath to support mental wellbeing. Attention to breathing is generally considered to be a foundational component of mindfulness practice, and long-term mindfulness training is associated with reliable differences in resting respiration rate, according to empirical research. <br/>
<br/>
Apple Watch can already track respiration rate while wearers are sleeping. Apple Watch uses its built-in accelerometer, which measures vibration and movement, to determine how many times a person breathes each minute. While the Vision Pro also has an accelerometer, it's unclear whether this hardware or sensors that track changes in facial musculature would be involved when a mindfulness session is in progress. <br/>
<br/>
There's no information suggesting if or when the feature could make an appearance, but Apple is expected to announce <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/visionos/">visionOS</a> 2 at its annual developers conference, WWDC, which begins next week, June 10.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AppleVisionPro">Vision Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-vision-pro.209">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/03/apple-vision-pro-mindfulness-respiration/">Apple Vision Pro Mindfulness App May Get &#039;Respiration Tracking&#039; Feature</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-vision-pro-mindfulness-app-may-get-respiration-tracking-feature.2428034/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

It's been a few weeks since we last tracked any notable markdowns on the Series 9, so if you've been waiting for a deal now is definitely the time to buy the wearable.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/12/series-9-blue.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-926442" /><em><small>Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with Amazon. When you click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment, which helps us keep the site running.</small></em><br/>
<br/>
You can get up to &#36;100 off most Apple Watch Series 9 models right now on Amazon, starting at <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FApple-Smartwatch-Aluminum-Fitness-Resistant%2Fdp%2FB0CSVB8BP1%3Fref_%3Dast_sto_dp%26th%3D1"><strong>&#36;299.00</strong></a> for the 41mm GPS watches. We've rounded up all of the deals in lists below, focusing on the aluminum devices, but you can also find &#36;100 discounts on a few stainless steel models as well.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fstores%2Fpage%2F2053BA59-F374-47FC-9333-5BF1839E8DEB%3Fingress%3D2%26visitId%3D41892507-7fff-44b6-896a-be2f1740c26f%26ref_%3Dast_bln"target="_blank"><div class="fancybutton"><div class="fancybadge">&#36;100 OFF</div>Apple Watch Series 9 Discounts at Amazon</div></a></div><br/>
<br/>
All of the Apple Watch Series 9 devices in this sale lack the Blood Oxygen feature that were available on models prior to the sales ban that began in the United States back in January. The sales ban covers any Apple Watch model with blood oxygen sensing, and since it began most retailers continued to sell through their stock of devices that still supported the feature.<br/>
<br/>
Now that it's been a few months, retailers like Amazon are starting to see their stock dwindle on Apple Watch Series 9 and Ultra 2 models with blood oxygen support. Other than this, the Apple Watch Series 9 is the exact same as it was when it launched, the new models just have blood oxygen disabled.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple is expected to announce <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a> in one week from now, and the update is rumored to include many new features for the Messages app on the iPhone.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/iOS-18-Messages-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2250" height="1266" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-953125" /><br/>
iOS 18 is set to be unveiled during the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/28/wwdc-2024-full-schedule/">WWDC keynote on June 10</a>, and the first beta should be made available to members of the Apple Developer Program immediately after the presentation. The first public beta of iOS 18 will likely follow in July, and the update should be widely released to all users with a compatible iPhone in September.<br/>
<br/>
Below, we recap what to expect from the Messages app on iOS 18.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>RCS Support</h2><br/>
Last year, Apple announced that it would <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/16/apple-to-adopt-rcs-messaging-standard/">support the cross-platform messaging standard RCS (Rich Communication Services)</a> in the Messages app starting "later" in 2024, so it will likely be an iOS 18 feature based on that timeframe.<br/>
<br/>
RCS support should result in the following improvements to the default messaging experience between iPhones and Android devices:<br/>
<br/>
<ul><br/>
 <li>Higher-resolution photos and videos</li><br/>
 <li>Audio messages</li><br/>
 <li>Typing indicators</li><br/>
 <li>Read receipts</li><br/>
 <li>Wi-Fi messaging</li><br/>
 <li>Improved group chats, including the ability for iPhone users to leave a conversation that includes Android users</li></li><br/>
</ul><br/>
<br/>
These features are already available for iMessage conversations with blue bubbles, and RCS will extend the capabilities to green bubbles over both Wi-Fi and cellular networks. It is expected that SMS will remain available as a fallback option.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Per-Word Effects</h2><br/>
Apple plans to add a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/31/ios-18-imessage-text-effects/">per-word text effects option</a> to the Messages app on iOS 18, multiple sources familiar with the matter told <em>MacRumors</em>.<br/>
<br/>
While it is already possible to send iMessages with entire-bubble or full-screen effects, such as invisible ink or confetti, the text effects would allow you to animate individual words within a message. Our hope is that Apple will also add bold, italics, and underline formatting options, but we have not confirmed that possibility.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Suggested Replies</h2><br/>
iOS 18 will add AI-generated suggested replies to the Messages app, according to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/26/10-ai-features-coming-in-ios-18/"><em>Bloomberg</em></a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/30/more-details-about-ios-18s-ai-features-revealed/"><em>AppleInsider</em></a>. This feature would analyze recent messages in a conversation and provide a few suggested replies that users could tap on to send.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Custom Emoji</h2><br/>
Another rumored AI-powered feature is the option to send <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/26/10-ai-features-coming-in-ios-18/">custom emoji that are automatically generated</a> based on the context of recent messages.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Message Recaps</h2><br/>
iOS 18 is rumored to provide <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/26/10-ai-features-coming-in-ios-18/">AI-generated recaps of information</a> from several apps, including recent messages received in the Messages app.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>New Tapback Icons</h2><br/>
Tapback icons (the heart, thumbs up, thumbs down, "haha," exclamation marks, and question mark that can be added to messages) may be redesigned on iOS 18, <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman said in his latest <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-06-02/apple-ipad-pro-m4-chip-review-company-inches-closer-to-laptops-with-new-tablets-lwxjbna0"><em>Power On</em> newsletter</a>.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/messages/">Messages</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/03/ios-18-rumored-features-for-messages-app/">iOS 18 Rumored to Add These 6 New Features to iPhone&#039;s Messages App</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-18-rumored-to-add-these-6-new-features-to-iphones-messages-app.2428029/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple has seemingly updated its <a href="https://www.apple.com/ipad-air/specs/">tech specs webpage</a> for the latest M2 iPad Air models to indicate the M2 chip has a 9-core GPU, rather than 10 cores as previously stated.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/M2-iPad-Air-Hero-Feature-Orange.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-949534" /><br/>
The change was first reported by <em><a href="https://9to5mac.com/2024/06/01/m2-ipad-air-gpu-core-count/">9to5Mac</a></em>. Based on available web snapshots, the update to Apple's US website was made within the last 10 days. However, the equivalent webpage on many of Apple's regional stores still lists the M2 iPad Air as having a 10-core GPU. <br/>
<br/>
Apple's <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2024/05/apple-unveils-the-redesigned-11-inch-and-all-new-13-inch-ipad-air-with-m2/">press release</a> originally announcing the product on its Newsroom also mirrors the original 10-core spec, as does <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/119894">support documentation</a> for the device.  <br/>
<br/>
Apple has not commented on the change, which, if accurate, makes the new iPad Air the first M2-based Apple device with a 9-core GPU. Since the change went live on Apple's site, the going theory is that Apple's processor yield of 10-core chips was not sufficient, so it is using a "binned" version of the 10-core chip with one of the GPU cores disabled. The practice of "binning" is sometimes used to optimize processor yields and reduce waste. <br/>
<br/>
In all likelihood, every M2 iPad Air model that Apple has sold includes a 9-core GPU, and Apple is simply updating its product information for accuracy. Any real-world performance difference between an M2 iPad Air with a 9-core versus a 10-core GPU would have arguably been unnoticeable to most users. Even so, some customers will probably want to know why Apple's marketing materials were mistaken.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/">iPad Air </a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPad-Air">iPad Air (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipad.137">iPad</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/03/apple-says-m2-ipad-air-9-gpu-cores-not-10/">Apple Says M2 iPad Air Has 9 GPU Cores, Not 10 as Originally Stated</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-says-m2-ipad-air-has-9-gpu-cores-not-10-as-originally-stated.2428016/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Justin Long, the face of Apple's iconic <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0eEG5LVXdKo">"I'm a Mac" commercials</a>, now stars in a short Qualcomm skit promoting Snapdragon-powered PCs.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5R3QpKMciEw?si=gr4XADXs59lte8Ku&amp;start=4626" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><br/>
At the Computex 2024 keynote, Qualcomm unveiled the new skit featuring Long, who is well-known for his role in Apple's "Get a Mac" commercials nearly two decades ago. Long is depicted as being overwhelmed by a barrage of notifications about app compatibility, low disk space, and battery issues in macOS, prompting him to search for an alternative in the form of a Windows on ARM PC. The ad concludes with Long stating, "Things change," a sentiment echoed by Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon during the event's closing remarks. Qualcomm's Snapdragon X Elite chips debut in new Copilot Plus PCs on June 18.<br/>
<br/>
Long's participation in the skit is the latest development in a series of marketing strategies where tech companies use his association with the "I'm a Mac" persona to promote their products. The trend began in 2017 when Huawei featured Long in an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2017/01/31/justin-long-joins-huawei-ad-campaign/">ad for its Mate 9 smartphone</a>. In 2021, Intel also employed Long to create commercials that praised PCs and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/17/justin-long-get-a-mac-intel-ad-campaign/">mocked various aspects of Apple's M1 MacBooks</a>, including the Touch Bar and its limited color options.<br/>
<br/>
Apple launched the original "Get a Mac" ad campaign in 2006. Long played a personified Mac, characterized as easygoing and efficient, while John Hodgman portrayed a PC, depicted as conformist and prone to problems like viruses and system crashes. The ads ran for three years and consisted of 66 different commercials, although Long revealed in 2019 that approximately 300 were filmed.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/qualcomm/">Qualcomm</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/03/im-a-mac-snapdragon-pc-skit/">Qualcomm Enlists &#039;I&#039;m a Mac&#039; Ad Star for Snapdragon PC Skit</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/qualcomm-enlists-im-a-mac-ad-star-for-snapdragon-pc-skit.2428015/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

The <a href="https://howl.me/cmn5Z7bb51W">&#36;449 Sonos Ace headphones</a> have some enticing design elements and features you won't see in Apple's headphones, so we thought we'd compare them to the &#36;549 <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-max/">AirPods Max</a> to see which is ultimately better.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe title="13" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xzG_OcEjNw8" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe><em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/macrumors?sub_confirmation=1">Subscribe to the MacRumors YouTube channel</a> for more videos.</em></div><br/>
In terms of design, both the Sonos Ace and &zwnj;AirPods Max&zwnj; are over-ear headphones that have a premium look, but the &zwnj;AirPods Max&zwnj; have a fancier feel because of the aluminum material. While Apple opted for brushed aluminum ear cups in a range of colors, Sonos went for recycled plastic in either black or white.<br/>
<br/>
Both have a minimal aesthetic, but the lack of aluminum makes the Sonos Ace lighter and more comfortable to wear. The &zwnj;AirPods Max&zwnj; are 13.6 ounces, and the Sonos Ace weigh 11 ounces. Two ounces might not sound like a lot, but it impacts comfort. The &zwnj;AirPods Max&zwnj; also tend to clamp tightly to the head, which the Sonos Ace don't do, so it's just easier overall to wear the Sonos Ace with the gentler fit.<br/>
<br/>
The ear cups on the Sonos Ace are made from memory foam covered with vegan leather, and Apple's ear cups are made from a mesh acoustic fabric that's supposed to better conduct sound than other materials. The soft Sonos Ace ear cups will probably be more comfortable for most people, but there might be less breathability just because of the nature of the fabric. Apple created a u-shaped mesh headband with telescoping arms, while the Sonos Ace uses the same vegan leather material also with telescoping arms.<br/>
<br/>
You can't fold the &zwnj;AirPods Max&zwnj;, and you also can't fold the Sonos Ace, but Sonos made a better case. It's slim, light, and offers full protection, unlike the unpopular case Apple offers with the &zwnj;AirPods Max&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
Sound quality is similar, but the Sonos app has an adjustable EQ for tweaking sound to your liking, which is something that can't be done on the &zwnj;AirPods Max&zwnj;. Both support spatial audio and Dolby Atmos, and Sonos' spatial audio is just as impressive as Apple's. The Active Noise Cancellation and Transparency options perform close to the same, and while Apple has the best Transparency mode, Sonos is right behind.<br/>
<br/>
You can pair the &zwnj;AirPods Max&zwnj; and the Sonos Ace to a TV set, but for the AirPods you'll need a &#36;129 <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a>, and for the Sonos Ace, you'll need the Arc Soundbar, which is &#36;719. Sonos plans to add Ace integration to its other soundbars, but none are cheap.<br/>
<br/>
Both pair to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>, and Mac with no additional hardware, but you get better connectivity with the &zwnj;AirPods Max&zwnj; thanks to fast switching and one tap pairing. It's more of a hassle to pair the Sonos Ace because it uses standard Bluetooth with no automatic pairing via <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/icloud/">iCloud</a>, so when you're changing devices, you'll need to manually reconnect.<br/>
<br/>
Sonos' headphones are several years newer than the &zwnj;AirPods Max&zwnj; at this point, and battery technology has improved. The &zwnj;AirPods Max&zwnj; only offer 20 hours of battery life with ANC and spatial audio turned on, while the Sonos Ace offer 30 hours of battery. Apple also hasn't updated the &zwnj;AirPods Max&zwnj; with USB-C, so they're still using the Lightning port that's being phased out. Unless you want to have to use a Lightning port for several more years, it's best to go with the Ace, another set of headphones, or wait for the &zwnj;AirPods Max&zwnj; USB-C refresh that's supposed to be coming later this year.<br/>
<br/>
Sonos priced the Ace &#36;100 cheaper than the &zwnj;AirPods Max&zwnj;, but it's pretty easy to find the &zwnj;AirPods Max&zwnj; at a discount these days. If you can live without quick pairing, automatic switching, and the Apple aesthetic, the Sonos Ace offer the same sound quality and ANC, plus they're more comfortable.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's upcoming iPhone 16 Pro models will have the thinnest bezels of any smartphone, beating the screen border thinness of even its latest iPhone 15 Pro devices. That's according to the leaker known as "Ice Universe," who has divulged accurate information about Apple's plans in the past.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/iPhone-16-Pro-Front-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-928695" /><br/>
According to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/16/iphone-16-display-sizes/">multiple sources</a>, despite minimal design changes, both iPhone 16 Pro models will increase in size this year. The iPhone 16 Pro is said to be 6.3 inches (up from 6.1), while the iPhone 16 Pro Max is expected to measure in at 6.9 inches (up from 6.7), potentially making it Apple's biggest iPhone ever. <br/>
<br/>
But it seems that Apple isn't just relying on larger physical dimensions to make the viewing experience more immersive. <a href="https://x.com/UniverseIce/status/1797408311513600503">According to Ice Universe</a>, this year's Pro models will also have reduced bezels that could be the thinnest yet seen on any smartphone, including those on the Samsung Galaxy S24. <br/>
<br/>
The breakthrough for achieving this could be Apple's rumored use of Border Reduction Structure (BRS) technology, which allows for a more compact and efficient layout of the circuitry under the display, resulting in even slimmer bezels. Ice Universe did not mention BRS, but <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/04/iphone-16-even-thinner-bezels/">two</a> <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/20/iphone-16-ultra-thin-bezels-rumor/">rumors</a> out of Asia have referenced the technology in relation to iPhone 16 models.<br/>

Last year, Apple reduced the bezels on iPhone 15 Pro models using low-injection pressure over-molding, or LIPO, to shrink the display border size to 1.5 millimeters (versus around 2.2 millimeters on iPhone 14 models). Besides that, Apple has not significantly tweaked iPhone screen sizes since the introduction of the ‌‌iPhone‌‌ 12 models in 2020. But as mentioned, things are set to change with the Pro models in the 2024 iPhone 16 lineup. <div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/">iPhone 16 Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/universeice/">UniverseIce</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/03/iphone-16-pro-thinnest-bezels-smartphone/">iPhone 16 Pro Could Break Record for Thinnest Bezels on a Smartphone</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-16-pro-could-break-record-for-thinnest-bezels-on-a-smartphone.2428008/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Amazon today has Apple's AirPods 2, AirPods 3 with Lightning Charging Case, and AirPods Pro 2 on sale, with up to &#36;59 in savings on these earbuds. For the AirPods 3, this is the first time we've tracked a discount on the device in about a month.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/05/Airpods-3-Discount-Feature-Orange.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-895373" /><em><small>Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with Amazon. When you click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment, which helps us keep the site running.</small></em><br/>
<br/>
The AirPods 2 are on sale for <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB07PXGQC1Q%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"><strong>&#36;89.00</strong></a>, down from &#36;129.00, and the AirPods 3 with Lightning Charging Case are on sale for <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0BDHB9Y8H%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"><strong>&#36;139.99</strong></a>, down from &#36;169.00. This discount on the AirPods 2 isn't quite an all-time low price, but it's still a good deal on the headphones that's about &#36;10 higher compared to the typical record low price.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB07PXGQC1Q%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"target="_blank"><div class="fancybutton"><div class="fancybadge">&#36;40 OFF</div>AirPods 2 for &#36;89.00</div></a></div><br/>

		<description><![CDATA[<em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-06-02/apple-ipad-pro-m4-chip-review-company-inches-closer-to-laptops-with-new-tablets-lwxjbna0">does not expect</a> Apple to announce any new hardware during its <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/28/wwdc-2024-full-schedule/">WWDC 2024 keynote on June 10</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/10/apple-tv-4k-yellow-bg-feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-870258" /><br/>
"There's no hardware slated to be announced at WWDC, unless Apple unexpectedly previews a new device launching later (to be clear: I don't expect that)," said Gurman, in his <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-06-02/apple-ipad-pro-m4-chip-review-company-inches-closer-to-laptops-with-new-tablets-lwxjbna0"><em>Power On</em> newsletter today</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Notably, Gurman now says a new Apple TV model "isn't imminent," despite previously reporting that Apple was aiming to release a new Apple TV <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/01/18/apple-tv-faster-chip-2024-launch/">in the first half of 2024</a>. The current Apple TV was introduced in October 2022.<br/>
<br/>
Here is when the previous five Apple TV models were announced:<br/>
<br/>
<ul><li><strong>Third-generation Apple TV 4K:</strong> October 2022</li><br/>
<li><strong>Second-generation Apple TV 4K:</strong> April 2021</li><br/>
<li><strong>First-generation Apple TV 4K:</strong> September 2017</li><br/>
<li><strong>Apple TV HD:</strong> September 2015</li><br/>
<li><strong>Third-generation Apple TV:</strong> March 2012</li></ul><br/>
<br/>
The next Apple TV is rumored to feature a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/01/18/apple-tv-faster-chip-2024-launch/">faster processor</a> than the current A15 Bionic chip, and even lower pricing. Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo suggested that the next Apple TV <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/10/18/kuo-even-cheaper-apple-tv/">could have a &#36;99 starting price</a> in the U.S., down from &#36;129 currently.<br/>
<br/>
No major design changes have been rumored for the next Apple TV specifically, but Gurman said Apple has considered <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/07/apple-tv-with-camera-again-rumored/">adding a built-in camera</a> to a future model. tvOS 17 <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/use-iphone-facetime-camera-apple-tv/">added a FaceTime app to the Apple TV</a>, allowing for users to have video calls on the TV, but this currently requires using the rear camera on a connected iPhone or iPad.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/wwdc/">WWDC 2024</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-inc-and-tech-industry.8">Apple, Inc and Tech Industry</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/02/gurman-no-new-hardware-at-wwdc-2024/">Gurman: No Hardware at WWDC, Next Apple TV No Longer Coming Soon</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/gurman-no-hardware-at-wwdc-next-apple-tv-no-longer-coming-soon.2427954/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>
