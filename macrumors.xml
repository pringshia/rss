		<description><![CDATA[Twilio has updated its Authy two-factor authentication (2FA) service after a hacker claimed to have retrieved 33 million phone numbers from its user database.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/authy.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="720" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-957591" /><br/>
<em><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/07/03/twilio-says-hackers-identified-cell-phone-numbers-of-two-factor-app-authy-users/">TechCrunch</a></em> reports that the hacker(s) known as ShinyHunters took to a well-known hacking forum to boast about the theft of 33 million cell phone numbers, achieved by what Twilio described as the use of an "authenticated endpoint." <br/>
<br/>
The U.S. messaging giant confirmed this week that "threat actors" gained access to its servers, resulting in the theft of users' phone numbers, but it did not specify how many were accessed. The company said it had taken action to secure the exploit and prevent similar future unauthenticated requests.<br/>
<blockquote>"We have seen no evidence that the threat actors obtained access to Twilio's systems or other sensitive data," said the company in a <a href="https://www.twilio.com/en-us/changelog/Security_Alert_Authy_App_Android_iOS">blog post</a>. "While Authy accounts are not compromised, threat actors may try to use the phone number associated with Authy accounts for phishing and smishing attacks; we encourage all Authy users to stay diligent and have heightened awareness around the texts they are receiving."</blockquote>As Twilio notes, obtaining a list of phone numbers may not appear in itself to pose a severe security threat. However, attackers could conceivably contact users and claim to be Authy or Twilio representatives in order to get them to reveal personal information as part of a phishing campaign. <br/>
<br/>
Users should update to the latest version of the iOS app, available on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a>. Twilio also advises users who cannot access their Authy account to contact its support team immediately.<br/>

At the beginning of the year, Authy announced that it was <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/15/authy-desktop-apps-end-of-life-march-2024/">shutting down</a> its Mac and Linux desktop apps in August 2024, but ended up bringing the date forward.

		<description><![CDATA[Code discovered on Apple's backend by <em>MacRumors</em> confirms Apple is indeed working on a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/27/touchscreen-homepod-everything-we-know/">long-rumored</a> home accessory in addition to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod/">HomePod</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/04/HomePod-G4-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-793597" /><br/>
The code references a device with the identifier "HomeAccessory17,1," which is a new identifier category. The name is similar to the &zwnj;HomePod&zwnj;'s "AudioAccessory" identifier.<br/>
<br/>
Interestingly, the 17,1 in the identifier name suggests that this device may receive Apple's upcoming A18 chip, which will be used in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/02/iphone-16-models-a18-chip/">all four iPhone 16 models</a> later this year. With the A18 chip, the HomeAccessory device would have the power for Apple Intelligence. <br/>
<br/>
The code also indicates that this "home accessory" will be running a software variant of tvOS, much like the &zwnj;HomePod&zwnj;. Earlier this year, <em>MacRumors</em> <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/29/tvos-17-4-homeos-mention/">found evidence</a> of Apple's work on homeOS, which could be the firmware running on this device.<br/>
<br/>
On a similar note, the code also references two unreleased &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj; models with the identifiers AppleTV14,4 and AppleTV14,5. Rumors suggest</a> that an updated &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj; could launch in 2024.<br/>
<br/>
Apple is expected to announce new iPhones, iPads, and potentially other products in September.<br/>

		<title>ChatGPT Mac App Stored User Chats in Plain Text Prior to Latest Update</title>

		<description><![CDATA[OpenAI has issued an update to its <a href="https://openai.com/chatgpt/mac/">ChatGPT app for Mac</a>, after a developer discovered the app was locally storing users' conversations with the chatbot in plain text.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/2chatgpt-mac-app.jpg" alt="" width="2940" height="1912" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-951953" /><br/>
Pedro José Pereira Vieito told <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/3/24191636/openai-chatgpt-mac-app-conversations-plain-text">The Verge</a></em>'s Jay Peters: "I was curious about why OpenAI opted out of using the app sandbox protections and ended up checking where they stored the app data." <br/>
<br/>
That led Pereira Vieito to develop "ChatGPTStealer," a simple app to <a href="https://www.threads.net/@pvieito/post/C85NVV6hvF6?xmt=AQGz0o3JtBOwk1nfUgk8lvxQoIV8E92xz1vK1IP8VC6zhA">demonstrate</a> how easy it is to load the chats in a text window outside of the ChatGPT app. After successfully trying out the app for himself, Peters said he was also able to see the text of conversations on his computer just by changing the file name, indicating the extent of the privacy risk.<br/>
<br/>
The ChatGPT Mac app is available solely through OpenAI's website, which is why it has not been obligated to follow Apple's sandboxing requirements that apply to software distributed via the Mac App Store. The oversight basically meant any other running app or process could potentially access the ChatGPT conversations without prompting the user for permission.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple will reportedly use a more advanced SoIC packaging technology for its M5 chips, as part of a two-pronged strategy to meet its growing need for silicon that can power consumer Macs and enhance the performance of its data centers and future AI tools that rely on the cloud.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/08/tsmc_semiconductor_chip_inspection_678x452.jpg" alt="" width="678" height="449" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-756102" /><br/>
Developed by TSMC and unveiled in 2018, SoIC (System on Integrated Chip) technology allows for the stacking of chips in a three-dimensional structure, providing better electrical performance and thermal management compared to traditional two-dimensional chip designs. <br/>
<br/>
According to the <em>Economic Daily</em>, Apple has expanded its cooperation with TSMC on a next-generation hybrid SoIC package that additionally combines thermoplastic carbon fiber composite molding technology. The package is said to be in a small trial production phase, with the intention of mass producing the chips in 2025 and 2026 for new Macs and AI cloud servers.<br/>
<br/>
References to what are believed to be Apple's M5 chip have already been <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/21/a19-and-m5-chips-discovered/">discovered</a> in official Apple code. Apple has been working on processors for its own AI servers made with TSMC's 3nm process, targeting <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/23/apple-developing-its-own-ai-server-processor/">mass production by the second half of 2025</a>. However, according to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/06/apple-building-m2-ultra-and-m4-servers/">Haitong analyst Jeff Pu</a>, Apple's plans in late 2025 are to assemble AI servers powered by its M4 chip.<br/>
<br/>
Currently, Apple's AI cloud servers are believed to be running on multiple connected M2 Ultra chips, which were originally designed solely for desktop Macs. Whenever the M5 is adopted, its advanced dual-use design is believed to be a sign of Apple future-proofing its plan to vertically integrate its supply chain for AI functionality across computers, cloud servers, and software.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[With the introduction of OLED displays, a thinner design, and more in the M4 <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a>, we thought it was worth taking another look at Samsung's flagship OLED tablet, the Galaxy Tab S9 Ultra, to see how the two compare and which one might be the better purchase for you.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1Pl-Ww8MZW4?si=qi2lbOvViKAdvxdC" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/macrumors?sub_confirmation=1">Subscribe to the MacRumors YouTube channel</a> for more videos.</em></div><br/>
Both tablets offer excellent OLED displays, though the Tab S9 Ultra's 14.6-inch 16:10 display is better optimized for video consumption than the &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj;'s 13-inch 4:3 display. The wider aspect ratio on the Tab S9 Ultra means widescreen video content fits much better on the display, offering a larger content view with much less letterboxing than on the &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
The Tab S9 Ultra's display is rated just a bit brighter than the &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj;'s, but in real-world usage the difference isn't noticeable. HDR content on the Tab S9 Ultra can get a bit too bright, however, washing out other content. The &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; also does a better job of handling glare, and that's not even accounting for the Nano-Texture option available on higher-end &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; configurations.<br/>
<br/>
The &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; and Tab S9 Ultra have similarly thin profiles, with the &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj;'s new design making it just a hint thinner than Samsung's offering, but the difference feels negligible. The Tab S9 Ultra maxes out at 1TB of built-in storage while the &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; goes up to 2TB, but Samsung includes a microSD slot that makes it simple to pop in extra storage at a much lower cost than boosting the integrated storage on an &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
Apple removed the Ultra Wide camera in the latest &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj;, leaving only the standard Wide camera for capturing video content. Samsung includes both styles of camera on the Tab S9 Ultra, but we don't think most people should be using their iPads for capturing video anyway.<br/>
<br/>
Where Apple really sets itself apart on the hardware side with &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; is the redesigned Magic Keyboard, which offers a premium feel, solid typing performance, an excellent trackpad, and an additional USB-C port for charging the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>. Samsung's first-party keyboard accessory for the Tab S9 Ultra looks and feels good, and the typing experience is pleasant, but the trackpad is simply awful.<br/>
<br/>
One note in favor of Samsung's keyboard is that it can be separated into two pieces, leaving the back cover attached to the tablet for protection. While Apple has a keyboard design like this for cheaper iPads, the Magic Keyboard can not be removed from the &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; without also removing the back cover.<br/>
<br/>
Alongside the new &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj;, Apple introduced a new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-pencil/">Apple Pencil</a> Pro with more advanced capabilities including new gestures and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/find-my-network-accessory-program/">Find My</a> support, but Samsung has the S Pen that also offers excellent integration with Android. Significantly for stylus adoption, the S Pen is included in the box with the Tab S9 Ultra, while the &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; Pro is an extra &#36;129 purchase for &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; owners.<br/>
<br/>
As with most purchasing decisions for Apple and Android, it's likely to come down to platform preference. If you're already thoroughly invested in the Apple ecosystem, you're probably going to want to go with the &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; to reap all of the benefits that come with Apple's tight integration. But if you're looking for something a bit different, Samsung's Galaxy Tab S9 Ultra offers some great features and a huge display at a price that well undercuts the &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj;.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Amazon and Best Buy have introduced record discounts on the latest 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models today, taking up to &#36;500 off of standard prices.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/m3-macbook-pro-blue.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-956595" /><em><small>Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with Amazon and Best Buy.

<br/>
Starting with the 14-inch models, the discounts begin with the entry-level M3 model with 512GB of storage, which is available for <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0CM5JV268%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20"><strong>&#36;1,399.99</strong></a> with an on-page coupon at Amazon for total savings of &#36;199 off the regular price. The 1TB model is similarly available for &#36;199 off with an on-page coupon, bringing the price down to <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0CM5KC8X7%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20"><strong>&#36;1,599.99</strong></a>.<br/>
<br/>
Moving to higher-end 14-inch models with the M3 Pro and M3 Max chips, you'll find &#36;300 discounts on several configurations:<br/>

<br/>
For the larger 16-inch models, both Amazon and Best Buy have record-low prices with discounts ranging from &#36;300 to &#36;500 across the various configurations:<br/>

<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/Tiptop-Trade-In-Large.jpeg" alt="" width="1280" height="720" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-957530" /><br/>
Online merchants powered by Shopify, Stripe, and more can <a href="https://tiptop.com/partner/signup">offer Tiptop at checkout</a>, with launch partners including electronics brand Nothing, game controller maker Backbone, pre-owned smartphone market Phonedaddy, and others. Tiptop manages the entire program for a merchant, including the trade-in, payment, and shipping.<br/>
<br/>
After selecting the Tiptop option during checkout on a participating merchant's website, you can search for the Apple product or other item that you would like to trade in, confirm the trade-in amount being offered, and choose to pay the remaining balance in full or in four interest-free installments. To send the item being traded in to Tiptop, customers can scan a QR code to start the prepaid shipping process, or have a courier pick up the item.<br/>
<br/>

Tiptop was founded by Bastian Lehmann, who also co-founded popular delivery service Postmates, and its marketing head is former <em>TechCrunch</em> editor-in-chief Matthew Panzarino. The startup had previously <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/15/tiptop-shop-trade-in-app/">launched a trade-in app</a>, but it is now promoting this trade-in service that online merchants can integrate into the checkout flow.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/03/tiptop-instant-trade-in-credit-for-apple-products/">Tiptop Provides Instant Trade-In Credit for Apple Products When Shopping Online</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/tiptop-provides-instant-trade-in-credit-for-apple-products-when-shopping-online.2430602/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Netflix is proceeding with its plan to discontinue its cheapest ad-free subscription tier, starting with the UK and Canada, with more countries inevitably to follow.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/02/Netflix-Smaller-2.jpg" alt="" width="2250" height="1266" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-884792" /><br/>
The streaming giant has reportedly begun <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/netflix/comments/1cgefm4/choose_a_new_plan_now_to_keep_watching/">notifying</a> users via on-screen messages about the last day they can access the service unless they upgrade. One Reddit user <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/mildlyinfuriating/comments/1dsse4n/cant_finish_netflix_subscription/">shared a notification</a> they had received from the Netflix app, saying: "Your last day to watch Netflix is July 13th. Choose a new plan to keep watching." Customers are being prompted to instead choose the cheaper Standard with ads, or the more expensive Standard or Premium 4K plans.<br/>
<br/>
In the UK, users are being informed that their £7.99 per month Basic plan has been discontinued and that they can sign up to the Standard with adverts plan for £4.99 or pay £10.99 for the Standard plan. The £10.99 plan includes access to 1080p streams, viewing on two devices simultaneously, and downloads on up to two devices. Meanwhile, the Standard with adverts tier still offers 1080p video quality but of course injects ads into streams.<br/>
<br/>
Canadian subscribers are also receiving notifications about the last viewing day for their Basic plan. In Canada, the price increase is more significant, rising from &#36;9.99 for the Basic plan to &#36;16.49 for the Standard plan. Alternatively, users can save &#36;4 by going with the Standard with Ads plan (&#36;5.99).<br/>
<br/>
The Basic plan, which costs &#36;11.99 per month in the United States, has not been available to new subscribers since last year. In its early 2024 earnings call, Netflix announced its intention to retire its Basic plan in some countries where the ads plan has been introduced, starting with Canada and the UK in the second quarter, and then "taking it from there." Netflix said in May that its ad-supported streaming tier has 40 million global monthly active users, up 35 million from a year ago.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/netflix/">Netflix</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/03/netflix-phasing-out-basic-ads-free-plan/">Netflix Starts Booting Subscribers Off Cheapest Basic Ads-Free Plan</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/netflix-starts-booting-subscribers-off-cheapest-basic-ads-free-plan.2430600/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today continued with the launch of its annual "Back to School" promotion, debuting back to school deals in most countries in Europe, some countries in Asia, the Middle East, and Mexico.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/back-to-school-2024.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-956521" /><br/>
Higher education students and educators in the <a href="https://www.apple.com/uk-edu/store#home">UK</a> can get up to a £120 Apple gift card with the purchase of select Macs and iPads, which is a similar deal to the one that went live in the United States and Canada <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/20/apple-back-to-schoo-promotion-launches/">last month</a>. <br/>
<br/>
Apple is offering a £120 gift card with any new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/">MacBook Air</a>, MacBook Pro, or <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/">iMac</a>, and a £80 gift card with the purchase of any new M4 <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m2/">M2</a> <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/">iPad Air</a>, or <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-mini/">Mac mini</a>.

<br/>
Meanwhile in most other countries, Apple is offering AirPods with every Mac or an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-pencil/">Apple Pencil</a> with every <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> sold through its education stores.<br/>
<br/>
Apple is providing its standard educational discounts, and students are able to get lower prices on Macs and iPads through the EDU store in each country, a link to which can be found under "Education" at the bottom of regional Apple stores. Students are also eligible for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/applecare/">AppleCare</a>+ at a 20% discount.<br/>
<br/>
Apple's Back to School promotion requires verification through UNiDAYS in many countries, with full terms and conditions available on the promotional pages for Apple's country-specific websites.<br/>
<br/>
Apple's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/back-to-school-promotion/">Back to School Promotion</a> will last through October 21, 2024 in most of the above listed countries, but it does end in September in some locations, such as Mexico.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/europe/">Europe</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/back-to-school-promotion/">Back to School Promotion</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/03/apples-back-to-school-sale-launches-europe-asia/">Apple&#039;s Back to School Sale Live in Europe, Asia, and the Middle East</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apples-back-to-school-sale-live-in-europe-asia-and-the-middle-east.2430598/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<title>Proton Launches End-to-End Encrypted Alternative to Google Docs</title>

		<description><![CDATA[Swiss privacy company <a href="https://proton.me/blog/docs-proton-drive">Proton</a> today launched Proton Docs, which it is pitching to customers as a "secure alternative to Google Drive and Docs."<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/proton-docs.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-957478" /><br/>
Proton Docs offers user end-to-end encrypted (E2E) document creation, editing, and collaboration, all of which is integrated with Proton's cloud storage product, Drive. <br/>
<br/>
The implementation of E2E means not even Proton can access your docs content or metadata (such as file names), and user data is kept on Swiss servers, where it is protected by <a href="https://proton.me/blog/switzerland">strict Swiss privacy laws</a>. <br/>
<br/>
Following Proton's recent acquisition of the encrypted notes app Standard Notes, Docs integrates many of its popular features, such as full support for markdown and rich text, code blocks and checklists. From Proton's press release, here are the highlights:<br/>
<blockquote><ul><br/>
    <li><strong>Rich Text Editing</strong>: Create and edit documents with advanced formatting options, allowing for professional and polished outputs.</li><br/>
    <li><strong>File Compatibility</strong>: Easily open and edit documents in multiple formats, including Microsoft .docx, ensuring seamless integration and continuous privacy protection.</li><br/>
    <li><strong>Comments and Collaboration</strong>: Add comments, reply to comments, and resolve them efficiently, fostering a collaborative environment.</li><br/>
    <li><strong>Embed Images</strong>: Enhance your documents by embedding images, providing visual context without compromising on speed.</li><br/>
    <li><strong>Collaborative Cursors and Presence</strong>: See who else is viewing the document in real-time with collaborative cursors, making teamwork more intuitive.</li><br/>
    <li><strong>Invite Collaborators</strong>: Easily invite anyone to collaborate on your documents. Participants without a Proton account will be prompted to create a free one, ensuring a secure environment for all.</li><br/>
</ul></blockquote><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/proton-docs-blog-2-collaboration@2x.jpg" alt="" width="2401" height="1200" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-957479" /><br/>
Drawing on its privacy-is-everything stance, the company says that every document, keystroke, and even cursor movement is end-to-end encrypted in real time. "Unlike Google Docs, Proton's commitment to never harvesting user data for any purpose, means information remains strictly private," promises the company.   <br/>
<br/>
Proton Docs is currently a web application, but Proton says it will eventually be offered as a dedicated app across platforms. Alongside Docs, Proton Drive includes a calendar, file storage, a password manager, and more. <br/>
<br/>
Docs requires a <a href="https://proton.me/pricing">free Proton Drive account</a>. Proton says it is rolling out Docs starting today, and the feature will be available to all users over the next couple of days.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/proton/">Proton</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/03/proton-launches-encrypted-google-docs/">Proton Launches End-to-End Encrypted Alternative to Google Docs</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/proton-launches-end-to-end-encrypted-alternative-to-google-docs.2430597/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/dolby-atmos-hdmi-passthrough.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-957473" /><br/>
The new functionality appears in various places in macOS 15, including Apple's TV, Music, and QuickTime Player apps. Apple says turning on the option lets users "Play supported audio in Dolby Atmos and other Dolby Audio formats using HDMI Passthrough when connected to a supported device."<br/>
<br/>
The feature is likely to be welcomed by users who connect their Mac to an external device that supports Dolby Atmos, such as an AV receiver or soundbar. When conected via HDMI cable, the device will be able to decode and output the full immersive Dolby Atmos audio as it was meant to be experienced by the creators, while sending any accompanying video signal to a connected TV.<br/>
<br/>
It's unclear whether this option will be included in tvOS 18, but given that Apple has made it a system-wide feature in &zwnj;macOS Sequoia&zwnj;, there is a good chance we will see it come to Apple TVs in a future update. Both &zwnj;macOS Sequoia&zwnj; and tvOS 18 are currently in developer beta, with public betas expected later this month, followed by a general release in the fall.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sequoia/">macOS Sequoia</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macos-sequoia.246">macOS Sequoia</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/03/macos-sequoia-supports-hdmi-passthrough/">macOS Sequoia Supports HDMI Passthrough for Dolby Atmos Content</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/macos-sequoia-supports-hdmi-passthrough-for-dolby-atmos-content.2430592/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[With <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a>, Apple overhauled the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/home-screen/">Home Screen</a>, introducing design changes that allow for more customization and personalization. You can put icons where you want, change their size, and give them new colors, plus you can hide apps and swap out your Lock Screen buttons.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/iOS-18-Home-Screen-Feature-2.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-957461" /><br/>
This guide highlights everything new coming to the &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj; &zwnj;Home Screen&zwnj; and Lock Screen.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="rearranging_icons">Rearranging Icons</h2><br/>
With &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj;, you can rearrange app icons and widgets on your &zwnj;Home Screen&zwnj; and app pages with space between them, providing a wealth of new layout options.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/ios-18-home-screen-icons.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-957464" /><br/>
Apple stuck with a grid system so you can only move app icons within the grid locations, but an icon can be placed anywhere in the grid with empty space around it. That sounds complicated, but with <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a>, if you added a new app to your &zwnj;Home Screen&zwnj;, it would automatically go to the next open spot.<br/>
<br/>
In &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj;, you can choose where to put it. You can have app icon-sized spaces between apps, full empty rows, and full empty columns. You can't put icons and widgets in places with uneven spacing because of the invisible grid limitation, so keep that in mind.<br/>
<br/>
You can put a single app in the middle of a page, have a row of apps at the top and a row of apps at the bottom, create a column of apps, and more. Apple created this design to allow you to place apps and widgets around wallpapers and arrange them into more useful layouts.<br/>
<br/>
Here's how to move your icons:<br/>
<ol><br/>
 <li>Long press on the &zwnj;Home Screen&zwnj; or on an app page to initiate wiggle mode.</li><br/>
 <li>Move apps into the desired positions.</li><br/>
 <li>Tap on done.</li><br/>
</ol><br/>
<h2 id="increase_icon_size">Increase Icon Size</h2><br/>
You can make your app icons bigger in &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj; by removing the app names. With app names in place, Apple needs space to display them, but removing them opens up a lot of area for a larger icon and folder size. Changing the app size does not change the number of apps that are visible, it simply removes text and uses up that empty space.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/hide-app-labels-home-screen-ios-18.jpg" alt="Home Screen" width="4377" height="2796" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-954852" /><br/>
With larger icons, you still get a maximum of six icon rows with four icons each, the same that you're limited to when icon names are turned on. To change icon size, follow these steps:<br/>
<ol><br/>
 <li>Long press on the &zwnj;Home Screen&zwnj; or an app page.</li><br/>
 <li>Tap on "Edit."</li><br/>
 <li>Tap on "Customize."</li><br/>
 <li>Choose Small to turn on app names, or Large to turn them off.</li><br/>
</ol><br/>
Note that this setting is universal, so you cannot have small icons on one app page and large icons on a different app page.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="change_widget_size">Change Widget Size</h2><br/>
You can change the size of widgets directly from the &zwnj;Home Screen&zwnj; without having to go into the customization options. <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/home-screen/">Widgets</a> now have a white rounded bar in the corner, which you can drag to make them larger or smaller.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/ios-18-resize-widgets.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-957465" /><br/>
<ol><br/>
 <li>Long press on the &zwnj;Home Screen&zwnj; or an app page to get into wiggle mode.</li><br/>
 <li>Use a finger to resize the widget to be smaller or larger.</li><br/>
</ol><br/>
You are limited to the minimum and maximum size available with any given widget. For example, the Battery widget can be the size of four app icons, six horizontal app icons in two rows, or a square shape that's four icons wide by four icons tall. When you resize the Battery widget, you are limited to those size options, but you don't need to go into the full widget settings to change the size.<br/>
<br/>
&zwnj;Widgets&zwnj; are still added to your &zwnj;Home Screen&zwnj; and app pages in the same way, though some of the labeling has shifted. Long press and tap on "Edit," then choose the "Add Widget" option. It's one more tap than it was before due to the new customization options.<br/>
<br/>
If an app has a widget, you can also long press on its icon to see widget options right there, turning the app's icon into a widget instead.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="new_widgets">New Widgets</h2><br/>
Apple added a new Health widget in &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj; that shows information from the new Vitals feature that's both in the Health app and on Apple Watch. It provides an overview of daily vitals or weekly vitals, plus there's also a new widget for cycle tracking.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/ios-18-new-widgets.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-957466" /><br/>
Vitals aggregates information from the Apple Watch to provide a daily readout of how your heart rate, sleep patterns, respiration, and blood oxygen change from day to day and week to week.<br/>
<br/>
There is a new Journal widget as well, with options that provide a writing prompt that you can tap on to open up the app to answer. You can also select a Streaks widget that keeps track of how many days in a row you've used the Journal app.<br/>
<br/>
For the new Training Load feature on Apple Watch, Apple has added a corresponding widget in the Fitness widget section.<br/>
<br/>
In the Home widget section, there are new widgets for electricity usage and electricity rates (a feature coming to select users in &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj; later this year).<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="dark_mode_icons">Dark Mode Icons</h2><br/>
Apple's built-in apps have both Light and Dark color options in &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj;, which allows you to change the color of your icons when you have <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ios-dark-mode/">Dark Mode</a> turned on. The Dark icons are all redesigned with a black background rather than a white or colored background, which makes them blend in better with the &zwnj;Dark Mode&zwnj; setting.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/ios-18-dark-mode-icons.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-956931" /><br/>
You can turn on Dark icons independently of having &zwnj;Dark Mode&zwnj; enabled, so you can leave Light mode on while using the Dark icon option. You can also set icons to an automatic mode, which means they'll change color depending on whether &zwnj;Dark Mode&zwnj; or Light Mode is active.<br/>
<br/>
Right now, it's only Apple's apps that have a Dark option, but third-party developers will presumably also be able to include two color options for their icons when &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj; launches.<br/>
<br/>
To go along with the &zwnj;Dark Mode&zwnj; icons, Apple also introduced a toggle that makes your wallpaper darker. Here's how to change your icon and wallpaper color:<br/>
<ol><br/>
 <li>Long press on the &zwnj;Home Screen&zwnj; or an app page.</li><br/>
 <li>Tap on "Edit."</li><br/>
 <li>Tap on "Customize."</li><br/>
 <li>Select Automatic, Dark, Light, or Tinted, an option described below. This is also the interface used to change app icon size, and darken your wallpaper (the sun icon).</li><br/>
</ol><br/>
The wallpaper option makes your chosen wallpaper a bit darker in color, dimming bright shades when enabled. Tapping toggles Light and Dark modes, with Light being your standard wallpaper color.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="icon_tints">Icon Tints</h2><br/>
In addition to choosing a &zwnj;Dark Mode&zwnj; for your app icons, you can opt to put a tint over all of them, which is an aesthetic that's useful if you want to match a wallpaper.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/iOS-18-Home-Screen-Feature-1.5.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-957459" /><br/>
You cannot change icon colors individually, and the tint changes the shade of <em>all</em> of the icons en masse. You can use an eyedropper to choose a color from your wallpaper, or you can use the two bars to tweak both hue and saturation. Tinting works with all icons because it desaturates and then places a color over the desaturated icon, so you do lose individual colors in app icons and widgets. It's a very monochromatic look.<br/>
<br/>
As with icon size, this is a universal setting so you cannot have different tints for different app pages. Tinting affects not only your app pages and &zwnj;Home Screen&zwnj;, but also the App Library. To change an icon tint:<br/>
<ol><br/>
 <li>Long press on the &zwnj;Home Screen&zwnj; or an app page.</li><br/>
 <li>Tap on "Edit."</li><br/>
 <li>Tap on "Customize."</li><br/>
 <li>Select Tinted and use the sliders to adjust the tint to your ideal color.</li><br/>
</ol><br/>
To turn off a tint, follow these same steps and then choose "Light" or "Dark" to get back to the standard app icon colors.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="hiding_and_locking_apps">Hiding and Locking Apps</h2><br/>
&zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj; includes a security feature for locking apps or even hiding them entirely from your &zwnj;Home Screen&zwnj; and app pages. A locked app requires a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mask-face-id/">Face ID</a> or <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/touch-id/">Touch ID</a> scan to open, so if someone is using your unlocked <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>, they still won't be able to open apps you've disabled.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/ios-18-lock-apps.jpg" alt="" width="5560" height="3128" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-954703" /><br/>
Hiding an app does the same thing as locking it, but goes a step further and removes it from view entirely. You'll only see it in a Hidden folder in the App Library, which also requires authentication to access. Locked and Hidden apps do not show up in searches on the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;, they're not accessible by <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a> without authentication, and notifications and alerts like calls from the app are disabled, so they're entirely private without authentication.<br/>
<br/>
The option to lock and hide apps is useful for when you need to hand your phone over to someone for viewing photos, playing games, or similar situations.<br/>
<br/>
For a locked app, there is no sign that it's locked until someone attempts to open it, at which point there's a &zwnj;Face ID&zwnj; or &zwnj;Touch ID&zwnj; authentication prompt. For hidden apps, they simply don't show up anywhere except the App Library.<br/>
<br/>
Apps <em>do</em> show up in your <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a> purchase/download list, but they don't show up in the Settings app. Settings for hidden apps can be accessed in a separate "Hidden Apps" folder that does require authentication to open up. How to lock or hide an app:<br/>
<ol><br/>
 <li>Long press on the icon of the app that you want to lock or hide.</li><br/>
 <li>Tap on "Require &zwnj;Face ID&zwnj;."</li><br/>
 <li>If you want to simply lock an app, tap on "Require &zwnj;Face ID&zwnj;" again. If you want to hide it, choose "Hide and Require &zwnj;Face ID&zwnj;."</li><br/>
 <li>Authenticate with a &zwnj;Face ID&zwnj; or &zwnj;Touch ID&zwnj; scan.</li><br/>
 <li>For a locked app, that's it. For a hidden app, you'll see a screen letting you know that you won't get notifications or calls from the app.</li><br/>
 <li>Tap "Hide App."</li><br/>
</ol><br/>
To remove the lock on an app, long press again on the icon on the &zwnj;Home Screen&zwnj; or app page and choose "Don't Require &zwnj;Face ID&zwnj;." You will need to authenticate to turn it off.<br/>
<br/>
To unhide an app, go to the App Library, select the Hidden section, authenticate with &zwnj;Face ID&zwnj; or &zwnj;Touch ID&zwnj;, long press on the app icon, and choose "Don't Require &zwnj;Face ID&zwnj; or "Unhide App." The first option turns off the lock and keeps the app off of the &zwnj;Home Screen&zwnj;, while the second both turns off the authentication requirement and adds it back to the first available opening on an app page.<br/>
<br/>
If you turn off the lock and do not add it back to the &zwnj;Home Screen&zwnj;, you'll need to find it in the App Library to put it back on the &zwnj;Home Screen&zwnj; later.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="lock_screen_updates">Lock Screen Updates</h2><br/>
Apple didn't make major changes to the Lock Screen because it was just overhauled with &zwnj;iOS 17&zwnj;, but there are a few updates worth noting.<br/>
<br/>
<h3 id="rainbow_time_and_other_new_lock_screen_widget_options">Rainbow Time and Other New Lock Screen Widget Options</h3><br/>
With &zwnj;iOS 17&zwnj;, Apple added an option to customize the font and the color of the time on the Lock Screen, and in &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj;, there's a new rainbow color option that adds a variegated rainbow shade for the time. There are no other changes to font or color options.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/ios-18-rainbow-lock-screen-time.jpg" alt="" width="2320" height="1305" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-957467" /><br/>
Above the time, you can add a new Journal widget that presents a journaling prompt and opens the app when you tap it.<br/>
<br/>
For widget options, there are new Health app Vitals widgets, and new entries for electricity usage and rates. These match the new &zwnj;Home Screen&zwnj; widgets.<br/>
<br/>
<h3 id="quick_buttons">Quick Buttons</h3><br/>
For the first time, you can change the Flashlight and Camera icons on the Lock Screen, picking something more useful or turning them off entirely.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/ios-18-lock-screen-buttons.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-954622" /><br/>
You can choose any Control Center option for the Lock Screen buttons, including Shortcuts, &zwnj;Dark Mode&zwnj;, Airplane Mode, Remote, Alarm Calculator, Translate, and more. This change ties into a redesign of the Control Center, and it gives you a lot more possibilities for what you can launch from the Lock Screen.<br/>
<br/>
Apple is allowing third-party apps to add Control Center icons, so you can also choose from those. Depending on what you pick, you may need to use &zwnj;Face ID&zwnj; or &zwnj;Touch ID&zwnj; to authenticate before being able to access an app from the Lock Screen in order to preserve user privacy and keep sensitive data from being easily accessible.<br/>
<br/>
To change your Lock Screen buttons, follow these steps:<br/>
<ol><br/>
 <li>Long press on the Lock Screen after authenticating.</li><br/>
 <li>Tap on Customize.</li><br/>
 <li>Tap on Lock Screen.</li><br/>
 <li>From this interface, tap on the "-" icon to remove any apps that are already assigned to those buttons. If you're doing this for the first time, you'll have the Flashlight and Camera apps set to the default, which need to be removed.</li><br/>
 <li>From there, tap on the "+" button and choose a new control to add.</li><br/>
 <li>Tap on Done in the upper right corner.</li><br/>
</ol><br/>
<br/>
<h3 id="ios_18_wallpaper">iOS 18 Wallpaper</h3><br/>
There are four new &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj; wallpaper options in pink, yellow, azure, and purple with a matching darker colored swoop. These all have a Light Mode and a &zwnj;Dark Mode&zwnj; shade customized by Apple, with the &zwnj;Dark Mode&zwnj; featuring a background glow for the darker part of the design.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/ios-18-wallpaper.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-957469" /><br/>
You can find the new wallpapers by long pressing on the Lock Screen, and choosing Customize to modify an existing wallpaper or "+" to add a new one entirely.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple Fellow and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a> chief <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/phil-schiller/">Phil Schiller</a> will take on a board observer position at OpenAI, reports <em><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-07-02/apple-to-get-openai-board-observer-role-as-part-of-ai-agreement">Bloomberg</a></em>. Apple has been granted an observer role as part of its agreement with OpenAI, which will see ChatGPT integrated into <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-18/">iPadOS 18</a>, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sequoia/">macOS Sequoia</a>, and Schiller has been selected for the role.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-953560" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/open-ai-logo.jpg" alt="" width="1093" height="615" /><br/>
A board observer is an informal board position where the participant is able to attend and contribute to board meetings, but is not allowed to vote and has no control. OpenAI has also given a board observer role to Microsoft, so Apple and Microsoft will be on even footing with Schiller's new position.<br/>
<br/>
Given Microsoft's relationship with OpenAI, future board meetings could cover new arrangements between OpenAI and Microsoft, which <em>Bloomberg</em> suggests could cause tension if Schiller is present. Microsoft can request that Schiller be excluded from these meetings, however.<br/>
<br/>
Schiller has not yet attended any OpenAI board meetings and is not set to do so until later in the year.<br/>
<br/>
Apple and OpenAI's deal will see <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a> able to hand complicated user requests over to ChatGPT with explicit user permission. OpenAI is not paying Apple to integrate ChatGPT in its operating systems, nor is Apple paying OpenAI. No money is being exchanged under the terms of the arrangement at the current time.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/chatgpt/">ChatGPT</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/openai/">OpenAI</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/02/apple-schiller-openai-board-observer/">Apple&#039;s Phil Schiller to Serve as OpenAI Board Observer as Part of iOS 18 AI Agreement</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apples-phil-schiller-to-serve-as-openai-board-observer-as-part-of-ios-18-ai-agreement.2430565/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-767473" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/10/apple-logo-cash-feature.jpg" alt="" width="1430" height="805" /><br/>
At the time, the fine had not been determined, but the judge presiding over the case handed down a ruling on Tuesday. The judge said that Levoff's violations were "especially egregious" even though he had not been "living excessively."<br/>
<br/>
At Apple, Levoff's role included making sure Apple employees were compliant with the company's insider trading policies, which is why the judge decided that his violation was of particular concern.<br/>
<br/>
Because Levoff was meant to prevent insider trading at Apple, he had access to Apple's earnings results before they were made available to the public. He used the information that he learned to buy Apple shares ahead of better-than-expected results, and to sell shares when there were weaker-than-expected earnings. Levoff's shady stock dealings earned him approximately &#36;277,000, while helping him avoid losses of around &#36;377,000.<br/>
<br/>
In July 2015, for example, Levoff knew Apple would not meet analysts' third quarter estimates for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> sales, so he sold &#36;10 million in Apple stock between July 17 and July 21, which is when Apple's earnings information went live. After the announcement, Apple stock dropped more than four precent.<br/>
<br/>
Levoff worked at Apple from 2011 to 2018, but he abused his insider information between 2011 and 2016. Apple fired him in September 2018 after the authorities contacted the company about Levoff's dealings. In June 2022, Levoff <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/07/01/former-apple-lawyer-pleads-guilty-insider-trading/">pleaded guilty</a> to six counts of securities fraud for insider trading. Federal prosecutors pushed for jail time to deter other corporate executives from insider trading, but the judge did not feel that it was necessary because Levoff was fired and is no longer be able to practice law.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/sec/">SEC</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/02/former-apple-lawyer-sec-fine/">Former Apple Lawyer Fined &#36;1.15 Million After Insider Trading Conviction</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/former-apple-lawyer-fined-1-15-million-after-insider-trading-conviction.2430564/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today seeded the second beta of an upcoming macOS 14.6 update to public beta testers, allowing non-developers to test the software ahead of its launch. Today's public beta comes two weeks after Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/20/apple-releases-first-macos-sonoma-14-6-public-beta/">released the first public beta</a>.<br/>
<br/>

Beta testers can opt-in through the Software Update section of the System Settings app. Under Beta updates, simply toggle on the Sonoma Public Beta. Note that you must sign up to participate on Apple's <a href="https://beta.apple.com">beta testing website</a>.<br/>
<br/>
No new Mac features were found in the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sonoma/">macOS Sonoma</a> 14.6 developer betas, so it is not clear what might be included. With Apple now working on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sequoia/">macOS Sequoia</a>, development on &zwnj;macOS Sonoma&zwnj; is beginning to wrap up so it's likely a bug fix update.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sonoma/">macOS Sonoma</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macos-sonoma.243">macOS Sonoma</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/02/apple-releases-macos-sonoma-14-6-public-beta-2/">Apple Releases Second macOS Sonoma 14.6 Public Beta</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-releases-second-macos-sonoma-14-6-public-beta.2430550/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today seeded the second betas of upcoming iOS 17.6 and iPadOS 17.6 updates to public beta testers, with the betas coming two weeks after the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/20/apple-releases-first-public-beta-of-ios-17-6/">initial iOS and iPadOS 17.6 developer betas</a>.<br/>
<br/>

Public beta testers can get the beta by opening up the Settings app, going to the Software Update section, tapping on the "Beta Updates" option, and toggling on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a> or <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-17/">iPadOS 17</a> Public Beta. Signing up on Apple's beta testing website is required.<br/>
<br/>
The new additions Apple promised for &zwnj;iOS 17&zwnj; have all been implemented at this point, so it is not clear what will be included in iOS 17.6, and no features were discovered in the developer betas.<br/>
<br/>
With Apple now shifting its focus to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a>, it is likely that iOS 17.6 will include bug fixes and other under-the-hood improvements.<br/>

		<title>Apple Leak Confirms Four iPhone 16 Models With Same A18 Chip</title>

		<description><![CDATA[Code discovered in Apple's backend by <a href="https://x.com/nicolas09F9">Nicolás Alvarez</a> and shared with <em>MacRumors</em> confirms Apple's plans to release four <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a> models this year, and it indicates that the devices will all have the same A-series chip. There are mentions of new model numbers that are not associated with existing iPhones, and that have the numbering scheme Apple uses for its flagship devices.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/iPhone-16-Camera-Lozenge-2.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-935160" /><br/>
The code includes the following <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> identifiers:<br/>
<ul><br/>
 	<li>iPhone17,1</li><br/>
 	<li>iPhone17,2</li><br/>
 	<li>iPhone17,3</li><br/>
 	<li>iPhone17,4</li><br/>
 	<li>iPhone17,5</li><br/>
</ul><br/>
All five start with the same number, which suggests that Apple plans to use the same chip for them. With the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a> models, which have different chips, the internal identifiers have separate numbers.<br/>
<ul><br/>
 	<li>&zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; - &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj;,4</li><br/>
 	<li>&zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; Plus - &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj;,5</li><br/>
 	<li><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a> - &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj;,1</li><br/>
 	<li>&zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; Max - &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj;,2</li><br/>
</ul><br/>
The &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; models have the A16 Bionic chip that was first used in the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-14/">iPhone 14</a> Pro models, which had corresponding model numbers of &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj;,2 for the &zwnj;iPhone 14&zwnj; Pro and &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj;,3 for the &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; Max. The &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; and Pro Max have the A17 Pro chip, hence the 16,x identifier.<br/>
<br/>
Apple's iPhones typically tie identifier to chip. Everything with the A16 chip has an identifier that starts with 15, and prior devices that had an A15 chip all had an identifier starting with 14. The same goes for the 13,x identifier (A14), and the 12,x identifier (A13).<br/>
<br/>
So if Apple sticks with the identifier numbering scheme it has used for years, all four &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; models will have the same chip, and that's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/27/iphone-16-lineup-a18-a18-pro-chips-analyst-says/">in line with rumors</a> and prior leaks. We've heard several rumors that the devices will share a chip, and an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/01/chip-details-of-16-upcoming-apple-devices-revealed/">earlier code leak in March</a> also confirmed the shared identifiers.<br/>
<br/>
Note that there are five model numbers listed, and only four are likely to be associated with the upcoming &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; lineup. The fifth could potentially be a future <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-se/">iPhone SE</a>, but there's no way to determine what that device is at this time.<br/>
<br/>
While we do expect all four &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; models to use a new A18 chip, Apple could still differentiate between the standard models and the Pro models, even giving the chips separate A18 and A18 Pro names. Apple could use A18 chips with a smaller number of GPU cores (either binned or disabled) for the &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; models, while saving chips with a better GPU for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/">iPhone 16 Pro</a> lineup.<br/>
<br/>
It would make sense for all four &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; models and a future &zwnj;iPhone SE&zwnj; to all have the same A18 chip because of the Apple Intelligence features set to debut in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a>. Apple Intelligence requires a high-powered chip for the AI features to run on-device. At this time, only the &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; and Pro Max are able to use Apple Intelligence, and Apple likely wants to make sure all future devices have the power required for machine learning and artificial intelligence tasks.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/">iPhone 16 Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/02/iphone-16-models-a18-chip/">Apple Leak Confirms Four iPhone 16 Models With Same A18 Chip</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-leak-confirms-four-iphone-16-models-with-same-a18-chip.2430548/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The Apple Watch Ultra 3, likely to be released in September 2024 alongside the iPhone 16, is expected to offer fewer upgrades compared to its predecessor, the Apple Watch Ultra 2. Keep reading to learn what the rumored changes are.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/Apple-Watch-Ultra-2-hero-feature-blorange.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-911679" /><br/>
When Apple Watch Ultra 2 debuted last year, key new features included a 50% brighter display, a faster S9 chip, a "Double Tap" gesture for interacting with the watch without touching the screen, on-device Siri, and increased internal storage. Unfortunately, the next version of the device is unlikely to reach those lofty heights. Here's what the rumors say.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="display_technology">Display Technology</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/09/apple-watch-ultra-night-mode.jpg" alt="" width="1598" height="953" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-866222" /><br/>
Initially, it was believed that Apple was working on an Apple Watch Ultra with a microLED display, which would provide increased brightness, better contrast, and improved battery efficiency. However, these plans appear to have been postponed indefinitely. Apple worked on microLED display technology for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/04/apple-still-dedicated-microled-apple-watch-ultra/">several years</a>, but the project was <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/22/apple-ends-microled-apple-watch-development/">scrapped in 2024</a> and there are no current plans for a microLED Apple Watch in the near future.<br/>
<br/>
On the flip side, Apple is rumored to be adopting new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/09/2024-apple-watch-more-power-efficient-display/">low-energy OLED panel technology</a> in new Apple Watch models to further reduce the power consumption of its always-on display. If that's the case, it's unlikely that Apple would use the technology in its latest Series model without also bringing it to its latest Apple Watch Ultra model.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="design">Design</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/09/Apple-Watch-Ultra-Orange-Alpine-Loop-Action-button-220907_big.jpg.large_.jpg" alt="" width="980" height="402" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-862625" /><br/>
The design of the Apple Watch Ultra 3 is likely to remain largely unchanged. <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-06-30/apple-s-longer-lasting-devices-ios-19-and-apple-intelligence-on-the-vision-pro-ly1jnrw4">recently said</a> that this year's third-generation Apple Watch Ultra will have "roughly the same look as the original." He has previously suggested a totally redesigned "<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-watch-x/">Apple Watch X</a>" with a thinner case and magnetic bands is coming, but this is likely to be a different model to the Ultra, and he said it would be released "in 2024 or 2025."<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="new_features">New Features</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/09/apple-watch-ultra-sandy.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-864665" /><br/>
The Apple Watch Ultra 3 is likely to include improved health tracking capabilities such as <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/01/2024-apple-watch-blood-pressure-sleep-apnea/">blood pressure monitoring and sleep apnea detection</a>, aligning with the rumored features of the Apple Watch Series 10 / X. <br/>
<br/>
The blood pressure monitoring featuring will let users know if their blood pressure is trending upward, and will provide an option for users to note what they were doing when hypertension occurred. Specific blood pressure numbers will not be provided, though. Meanwhile, sleep apnea detection will use sleep history and breathing patterns to estimate whether someone suffers from sleep apnea, with the watch suggesting that users contact a doctor if so.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="hardware_updates">Hardware Updates</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/09/apple-watch-ultra-1-1.jpg" alt="" width="3840" height="2160" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-866346" /><br/>
The Apple Watch Ultra 3 is expected to have "almost no" new hardware upgrades compared to the Apple Watch Ultra 2, according to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/01/kuo-on-apple-watch-ultra-3-hardware/">Apple supply chain analyst Ming-Chi Kuo</a>. His phrasing suggests that the rumored blood pressure and sleep apnea detection features will be machine learning / software-based, relying on existing sensors.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="colors">Colors</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/08/Apple-Watch-Ultra-Black-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-905396" /><br/>
Apple currently offers the Apple Watch Ultra 2, released in September 2023, in the same natural titanium color as the first-generation model. Prior to launch of the second-generation model, some rumors suggested Apple could release a new darker color option. It didn't happen.<br/>
<br/>
However, we know that Apple originally designed a first-generation Apple Watch Ultra with a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/17/new-apple-watch-ultra-black-prototype-images/">dark ceramic back</a> that was never launched. Moreover, <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman in 2023 said it was "theoretically" possible the finish could be released for a later model. Previously, the high-end Edition model of the Apple Watch Series 7 was available with a Space Black titanium case.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="watchos_11">watchOS 11</h2><br/>

One thing we can be sure of is that Apple Watch Ultra 3 will run <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/watchos-11/">watchOS 11</a>, the latest version of the Apple Watch operating system. Apple previewed the software during WWDC in June, and users can expect a range of updates and improvements, such as additional Smart Stack widgets, Check In for Messages and workouts, a Vitals app to view key health metrics, a Translate app, a new Apple Pay feature called Tap to Cash, training load for workouts, additional workout types, more customizable Activity rings, and more.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch-ultra/">Apple Watch Ultra 2</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch_Ultra">Apple Watch Ultra (Caution)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-watch.172">Apple Watch</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-watch-ultra-3-everything-we-know/">Apple Watch Ultra 3: Everything We Know So Far</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-watch-ultra-3-everything-we-know-so-far.2430530/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[When Apple released macOS Monterey in 2021, some key features required a Mac with Apple silicon. The same scenario played out with macOS Ventura in 2022, and then again the following year with the release of macOS Sonoma. With macOS Sequoia set to arrive in the fall, which new features can Intel Mac owners expect to be unavailable to them this time around?<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/Apple-WWDC24-macOS-Sequoia-hero-240610.jpg" alt="" width="1960" height="1102" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-954631" /><br/>
Apple says that macOS Sequoia is compatible with the same Macs as macOS Sonoma other than the 2018 and 2019 MacBook Air, but Apple's fine print reveals that certain new features won't work on Intel machines that are otherwise compatible with macOS Sequoia. If you're still on an Intel Mac, here's what you won't have access to.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Apple Intelligence</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/apple-intelligence.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-954498" /><br/>
<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/10/apple-intelligence-generative-personal-ai-unveiled-for-iphone-ipad-and-mac/">Apple Intelligence</a>, a deeply integrated, personalized AI feature set for Apple devices that uses cutting-edge generative artificial intelligence to enhance the user experience, won't be available on Intel Macs. Apple says the advanced features require its M1 chip or later, so if your Mac was released before November 2020, you're out of luck.<br/>

<br/>
<h2>Live Audio Transcription</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/apple-notes-live-audio-transcription.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-957406" /><br/>
Live audio transcription lets you record audio sessions within notes in Apple Notes, and generate live audio transcriptions that can be searched through or combined with other documents, checklists, or documents. According to Apple, support for live audio transcription in the Notes app is limited to machines powered by Apple silicon. <br/>
<br/>
<h2>What Else?</h2><br/>
Surprisingly, nothing! Apple is not withholding any other new features in macOS Sequoia, meaning users with supported Intel Macs will be able to enjoy things like the ability to schedule messages to send later, Reminder integration with Calendars, a new standalone Passwords app, window tiling, and more. Even Apple's latest continuity feature, iPhone Mirroring, works on Intel-based Mac computers that have a T2 Security Chip. For all the details, be sure to check out our <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sequoia/">macOS 15 roundup</a>.<br/>
<br/>
On that note, let's review which Mac models that macOS Sequoia supports. As mentioned above, macOS 15 works with the same Macs as macOS Sonoma other than the 2018 and 2019 MacBook Air. They include:<br/>
<ul><br/>
    <li>MacBook Air (2020 and later)</li><br/>
    <li>MacBook Pro (2018 and later)</li><br/>
    <li>iMac (2019 and later)</li><br/>
    <li>Mac Mini (2018 and later)</li><br/>
    <li>iMac Pro (2017 and later)</li><br/>
    <li>Mac Pro (2019 and later)</li><br/>
    <li>Mac Studio (2022 and later)</li><br/>
</ul><br/>
You can check your Mac's model by clicking the Apple in the menu bar and choosing About This Mac. macOS Sequoia is currently in developer beta, with a public beta expected later this month, before Apple's latest Mac software gets a general release in the fall.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sequoia/">macOS Sequoia</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macos-sequoia.246">macOS Sequoia</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/02/macos-sequoia-features-intel-macs-wont-support/">Here Are the macOS Sequoia Features Intel Macs Won&#039;t Support</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/here-are-the-macos-sequoia-features-intel-macs-wont-support.2430519/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>
