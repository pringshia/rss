		<description><![CDATA[Alexa now natively supports Apple Podcasts on Amazon Echo and Amazon Fire TV devices in over 40 countries following the latest expansion of this integration.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/05/Podcasts-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2250" height="1266" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-798617" /><br/>
Apple Podcasts for Alexa is now available in Argentina, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Denmark, Ecuador, Finland, France, Germany, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, Malaysia, Mexico, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Peru, Philippines, Poland, Portugal, Puerto Rico, Singapore, South Africa, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan, Thailand, Türkiye, the U.K., and the U.S., according to an <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT210759">Apple support document</a> updated today.<br/>
<br/>
This integration allows you to ask Alexa to play podcasts from the Apple Podcasts app. You can link your Apple ID in the Alexa app to keep playback in sync across your Apple devices and supported Alexa devices. For example, you can start listening to a podcast episode through the Apple Podcasts app on CarPlay during your commute, and continue listening with your Echo speaker at home by asking Alexa to resume the podcast.<br/>
<br/>
Apple Podcasts can also be set as your preferred podcast platform in the Alexa app.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[The United States Federal Communications Commission <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/document/fcc-permits-very-low-power-device-operations-6-ghz-band">today opened up</a> 6GHz Wi-Fi spectrum to low power devices like AR/VR wearables (via <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/19/23923015/fcc-6ghz-approval-very-low-power-devices-apple-google-meta">The Verge</a></em>). This means that AR/VR devices like Apple's Vision Pro headset will be able to operate on the 6GHz band, though it is unclear if the initial version of the Vision Pro will be able to take advantage of this functionality. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2016/02/apple-vision-pro.jpeg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-899007" /><br/>
Apple, Google, Meta, Microsoft, Intel, Qualcomm, and more teamed up in 2019 to ask the FCC to allow Very Low Power (VLP) devices that transmit at a low power threshold to use 6GHz spectrum without restrictions, which the FCC has now approved. The approval is for short range, tethered connections between two devices, such as the Vision Pro headset and an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> or an in-car system like <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/carplay/">CarPlay</a> and an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;.<blockquote>Recognizing the need to provide even more flexibility and foster unlicensed innovation, the Commission established rules that permit devices that operate at very low power (VLP) across short distances and provide very high connection speeds, which are ideal for the types of high- data rate cutting-edge applications that will both enrich consumer experiences and bolster the nation's economy. These include, for example, advanced augmented and virtual reality (AR/VR), wearable sensors and technologies, and variety of Internet of Things devices.</blockquote>The FCC says that its new rules limit devices to low power levels and subject them to other technical requirements that will allow them to operate while protecting licenses that carriers have for 6GHz spectrum. Devices can, however, access higher power levels when subject to a geofencing system that prevents interference to licensed operations.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/fcc/">FCC</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/19/fcc-apple-6ghz-spectrum/">FCC Says Apple Can Use Faster 6GHz Spectrum for Headsets, CarPlay, and More</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/fcc-says-apple-can-use-faster-6ghz-spectrum-for-headsets-carplay-and-more.2408109/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple is working on a larger <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/">iPad Air</a> featuring a 12.9-inch display, in what would be the biggest &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; model to date, <em><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/digitimes-com/">DigiTimes</a></em> reports.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/iPad-Air-12.9-Inch-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2192" height="1233" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-917813" /><br/>
Citing industry sources, <em>&zwnj;DigiTimes&zwnj;</em> highlighted that unlike the 12.9-inch <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a>, the 12.9-inch &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; will not feature a mini-LED display. The device will instead feature the same LCD technology used in the current, 10.9-inch &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj;. The information was shared in <em>&zwnj;DigiTimes&zwnj;</em>' "Before Going to Press" section, so while information about the new device is currently limited, more will follow tomorrow.<br/>
<br/>
The &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; has only ever been available in a single size, so presumably a 12.9-inch &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; would be offered in addition to a separate model with a smaller screen, just like how the &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; is offered in both 11- and 12.9-inch variants. A recent <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/05/apple-two-ipad-air-models/">rumor from <em>9to5Mac</em></a> claimed that Apple was working on two sixth-generation &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; models. While the piece speculated that Apple could release a larger version of the ‌&zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj;‌ to go along with the current 10.9-inch version, <em>&zwnj;DigiTimes&zwnj;</em>' report is the first specific mention of a larger &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; variant.<br/>
<br/>
Together, the rumors suggest that the 12.9-inch &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; could arrive sooner rather than later in the sixth incarnation of the device. The current &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; featuring the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m1/">M1</a> chip launched over a year and a half ago, and a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/05/ipad-air-6-new-features-and-launch-timing/">new model with the M2 chip</a> is widely expected to launch in the coming months.<br/>
<br/>
The current, 10.9-inch &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; is priced starting at &#36;599, while the 11-inch &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; starts at &#36;799. A 12.9-inch &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; model would presumably be priced between these two products, but it is worth bearing in mind that Apple's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/18/2024-ipad-pro-what-to-expect/">next-generation iPad Pro models</a> are rumored to see <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/09/2024-oled-ipad-pro-starting-prices/">price hikes</a> owing to their costly OLED display technology.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/">iPad Air </a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/digitimes-com/">DigiTimes</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPad-Air">iPad Air (Don't Buy)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipad.137">iPad</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/19/apple-working-on-larger-ipad-air/">Apple Working on Larger iPad Air With 12.9-Inch Display</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-working-on-larger-ipad-air-with-12-9-inch-display.2408089/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<title>iPhone 16 and 16 Plus Again Rumored to Jump From A16 to A18 Chip</title>

		<description><![CDATA[All four iPhone 16 models will be equipped with A18-branded chips, according to Jeff Pu, an analyst who covers Apple and its supply chain. He <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/27/iphone-16-lineup-a18-a18-pro-chips-analyst-says/">first shared this prediction last month</a>, and he touched on the topic again in a research note this week with Hong Kong-based investment firm Haitong International Securities.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/iPhone-16-To-Skip-A17-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-917794" /><br/>
In his latest note, Pu said "we expect all iPhone 16 models to feature A18," and he expects the chips to be manufactured with chipmaker TSMC's second-generation 3nm process "N3E." Pu referred to the A17 Pro chip in the iPhone 15 Pro models, based on TSMC's first-generation 3nm process "N3B," as a "transition design."<br/>
<br/>
In response to an email from <em>MacRumors</em> last month, Pu outlined his specific expectations:<ul><li><strong>iPhone 16:</strong> A18 chip (N3E)</li><br/>
<li><strong>iPhone 16 Plus:</strong> A18 chip (N3E)</li><br/>
<li><strong>iPhone 16 Pro:</strong> A18 Pro chip (N3E)</li><br/>
<li><strong>iPhone 16 Pro Max:</strong> A18 Pro chip (N3E)</li></ul>N3E is less expensive and has improved yield compared to N3B, according to TSMC.<br/>
<br/>
The standard iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus use the A16 Bionic chip, so a jump to the A18 chip for the iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus would be a notable and unique change, as it means these two models would skip over an A17-branded chip.<br/>
<br/>
Given that the iPhone 16 lineup is still around 11 months away from launching, Pu is likely making an educated guess here with the marketing names, so it remains to be seen if Apple actually moves forward with A18 and A18 Pro branding. It is possible that Apple could brand its iPhone 16 chips as the A17 and A18 Pro, mirroring recent years.<br/>
<br/>
Pu was the first source to report that Apple had <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/07/06/iphone-16-pro-solid-state-buttons-low-chance/">abandoned its plans for solid-state buttons</a> on the iPhone 15 Pro models. He also accurately revealed that the iPhone 15 Pro models would be equipped with an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/01/02/iphone-15-pro-features-specs-rumors/">increased 8GB of RAM</a>, and that the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/07/06/iphone-15-pro-max-more-expensive/">iPhone 15 Pro Max would have a higher starting price</a> than the iPhone 14 Pro Max.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/jeff-pu/">Jeff Pu</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/19/iphone-16-jump-from-a16-to-a18-chip-rumor/">iPhone 16 and 16 Plus Again Rumored to Jump From A16 to A18 Chip</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-16-and-16-plus-again-rumored-to-jump-from-a16-to-a18-chip.2408082/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple plans to start implementing generative AI technology on the iPhone and iPad in late 2024 at the earliest, according to Jeff Pu, an analyst who covers Apple's supply chain for Hong Kong-based investment firm Haitong International Securities.  <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/iOS-18-Mock-Siri-Feature-Baubles.jpg" alt="" width="2250" height="1266" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-909208" /><br/>
In a research note on Wednesday, Pu said his supply chain checks suggest that Apple is likely to build a few hundred AI servers in 2023, and significantly more next year. He believes Apple will offer a combination of cloud-based AI and so-called "edge AI," which involves more on-device data processing. He added that patience will be required with Apple's rollout of generative AI, as the company considers how to use and process personal data in a way that aligns with its commitment to customer privacy.<br/>
<br/>
If met, the late 2024 timeframe would mean that Apple could begin rolling out generative AI features starting with iOS 18 and iPadOS 18, but it remains to be seen how it uses the technology. <em>The Information</em> last month reported that Apple plans to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/06/ios-18-siri-improvements/">incorporate large language models into Siri</a> to let users automate complex tasks, a feature that would involve deeper integration with the Shortcuts app. The report said this feature is expected to be released in an iPhone software update next year, so it could be part of iOS 18.<br/>
<br/>
In August, supply chain analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said Apple's generative AI efforts were "<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/02/no-sign-of-apple-generative-ai-coming-2024/">significantly behind its competitors</a>," so it's unclear if the late 2024 timeframe is realistic. It is possible the technology will not be ready until 2025 and onwards.<br/>
<br/>
Generative AI surged in popularity last year when OpenAI released ChatGPT, a chatbot that can respond to questions and other prompts. Google and Microsoft released similar chatbots earlier this year, as more companies race into the space. The chatbots are trained on large language models, allowing them to respond like a human.<br/>
<br/>
In July, <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman said Apple was <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/07/19/apple-experimenting-with-chatgpt-tool/">internally testing a "ChatGPT-like" chatbot</a> nicknamed "Apple GPT," but he said the company had yet to "devise a clear strategy" for releasing generative AI tools to the public.<br/>
<br/>
Apple has publicly confirmed its interest in generative AI, and it has mentioned the technology in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/06/02/apple-seeking-generative-ai-engineers-for-ar-vr/">job listings posted on its website</a> in recent months.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Netflix today said  that it is increasing the cost of some of its subscription plans in the United States, the UK, and France. Prices will be going up for the Basic and Premium plans in those three countries.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/02/Netflix-Smaller-3.jpg" alt="" width="2250" height="1266" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-884793" /><br/>
In the United States, the price of the Basic plan will increase from &#36;9.99 to &#36;11.99 per month, while the price of the Premium plan will increase from &#36;19.99 to &#36;22.99 per month. The ad-supported tier price will remain the same at &#36;6.99 per month, as will the &#36;15.49/month Standard plan.<br/>
<br/>
Netflix no longer offers the Basic plan to new subscribers in the United States, but prices will presumably increase for existing subscribers.<br/>
<br/>
The Premium Netflix plan is the only plan that provides access to 4K video streaming and spatial audio. The &#36;15.49 Standard plan and the ad-supported plan are limited to 1080p.<br/>
<br/>
Netflix announced the price hikes in its earnings call for the third quarter of 2023 [<a href="https://s22.q4cdn.com/959853165/files/doc_financials/2023/q3/FINAL-Q3-23-Shareholder-Letter.pdf">PDF</a>], which took place today. Netflix said that it added 8.8 million new subscribers, up from 2.4 million new subscribers in the year-ago quarter. Revenue came in at &#36;8.54 billion, up from &#36;7.9 billion last year.<br/>
<br/>
Subscriber growth comes after Netflix began <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/06/09/netflix-password-crackdown-subscriber-increase/">cracking down on password sharing</a> between households. Netflix says that cancel reaction to the password sharing limitation "continues to be low," exceeding its expectations.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/netflix/">Netflix</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/18/netflix-price-increase-2023/">Netflix Raising U.S. Prices Yet Again, Premium Plan Now Costs &#36;23/Month</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/netflix-raising-u-s-prices-yet-again-premium-plan-now-costs-23-month.2408016/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The iOS 17.1 update that is expected to be released to the public next week does not appear to address an issue that is causing some <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> models to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/11/iphone-models-turning-off-at-night/">turn off sporadically at night</a>, interrupting alarms, silencing notifications, and otherwise disrupting nighttime &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; usage.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/iphone-shutdown-issue.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-917657" /><br/>
On devices running iOS 17.1, we here at <em>MacRumors</em> have continued to experience problems, and there are also continued reports about the issue <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/all-iphones-spontaneously-rebooted-last-night.2407082/">on the <em>MacRumors</em> forums</a>, both from those running iOS 17.0.3 and those running iOS 17.1.<br/>
<br/>
If your &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; opens to the passcode screen in the morning, or if an alarm fails to go off at the correct time, it's likely you have been impacted by this bug. In some cases, the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; merely reboots, but in other cases, it turns off for several hours. The shutdown bug appears to impact multiple &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; models, though many of the complaints have been from <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a> users.<br/>
<br/>
You can tell if your ‌&zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;‌ turned off at night by opening up the Settings app, navigating to Battery, and checking the charging status over the past 24 hours. If there's a gap, the ‌&zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;‌ was turned off for a period of time.<br/>
<br/>
There is no word on when this issue might be fixed, and Apple has yet to comment.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-17/">iPadOS 17</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-17.241">iOS 17</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-17.242">iPadOS 17</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/18/ios-17-1-shutdown-bug-no-fix/">PSA: iOS 17.1 Doesn&#039;t Fix Nighttime iPhone Shutdown Bug</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/psa-ios-17-1-doesnt-fix-nighttime-iphone-shutdown-bug.2408012/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today <a href="https://developer.apple.com/safari/download/">released a new update</a> for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/safari-technology-preview/">Safari Technology Preview</a>, the experimental browser Apple <a href="http://www.macrumors.com/2016/03/30/apple-safari-technology-preview-browser/">first introduced</a> in March 2016. Apple designed the &zwnj;Safari Technology Preview&zwnj; to test features that may be introduced into future release versions of Safari.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-785724" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/02/Safari-Technology-Preview-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2368" height="1332" /><br/>
&zwnj;Safari Technology Preview&zwnj; 181 includes fixes and updates for CSS, HTML, JavaScript, Media, Rendering, and SVG.<br/>
<br/>
The current &zwnj;Safari Technology Preview&zwnj; release is compatible with machines running macOS Ventura and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sonoma/">macOS Sonoma</a>, the latest version of macOS that Apple released in September 2023. <br/>
<br/>
The &zwnj;Safari Technology Preview&zwnj; update is available through the Software Update mechanism in System Preferences or System Settings to anyone who has <a href="https://developer.apple.com/safari/download/">downloaded the browser</a>. Full release notes for the update are available <a href="https://developer.apple.com/safari/technology-preview/release-notes/">on the Safari Technology Preview website</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Apple's aim with &zwnj;Safari Technology Preview&zwnj; is to gather feedback from developers and users on its browser development process. &zwnj;Safari Technology Preview&zwnj; can run side-by-side with the existing Safari browser and while designed for developers, it does not require a developer account to download.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/18/apple-releases-safari-technology-preview-181/">Apple Releases Safari Technology Preview 181 With Bug Fixes and Performance Improvements</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-releases-safari-technology-preview-181-with-bug-fixes-and-performance-improvements.2408006/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Google today <a href="https://blog.google/products/chrome/chrome-address-bar-updates/">shared some information</a> on updates that it is making to the address bar (or search bar) on mobile devices and the web, with these updates aimed at making it easier to find the website that you're looking for.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/06/Chrome-Feature-22.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-851161" /><br/>
When you make a typo when putting in a URL, Chrome can detect the typo and show you suggestions of the site you might actually want to visit based on your previously visited websites. Chrome is also smarter at autocompleting URLs, filling in suggestions based on sites you've visited in the past.<br/>
<br/>
If, for example, you have visited https://www.google.com/travel/flights in the past, just typing in "flights" will see Google bringing that website up as a suggestion to visit. The typo correction features are available now on the desktop and on iOS, while the autocompletion update is limited to the desktop for now.<br/>
<br/>
Chrome now allows you to search within your bookmark folders from the address bar, and it will suggest highly popular sites even if you've never visited them, two features available on both the desktop and mobile devices. Finally, Chrome on the desktop has an improved visual layout that offers faster response times and makes the address bar easier to read.<br/>
<br/>
More information on the changes can be <a href="https://blog.google/products/chrome/chrome-address-bar-updates/">found in Google's Chrome blog</a>.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/chrome/">Chrome</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/18/chrome-address-bar-improvements/">Google Chrome Address Bar Gains Improved Typo Correction and Autocompletion</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/google-chrome-address-bar-gains-improved-typo-correction-and-autocompletion.2407993/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple now offers three different <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-pencil/">Apple Pencil</a> models at &#36;79, &#36;99, and &#36;129 price points, each with different feature sets. Our guide helps you decide which &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; is best for you.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/Apple-Pencil-Buyers-Guide-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-917643" /><br/>
Which &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; you should buy is firstly determined by which <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> model you have. Some &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; models are only compatible with one kind of &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj;, while others are compatible with two. If your &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; model only supports one kind of &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj;, your buying decision is straightforward. Use the table below to find out which &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; models your &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; supports:<br/>
<br/>
<table class="comparison"><br/>
 <tr><br/>
 <th>&zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; (first-generation, 2015)</th><br/>
 <th>&zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; (second-generation, 2018)</th><br/>
 <th>&zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; (USB-C, 2023)</th><br/>

 <td>&zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; 11-inch (first-, second-, third-, and fourth-generation)</td><br/>
 <td>&zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; 11-inch (first-, second-, third-, and fourth-generation)</td><br/>
 </tr><br/>
 <tr><br/>
 <td><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/">iPad Air</a> (third-generation)</td><br/>
 <td>&zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; (fourth- and fifth-generation)</td><br/>
 <td>&zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; (fourth- and fifth-generation)</td><br/>
 </tr><br/>
 <tr><br/>
 <td><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-mini/">iPad mini</a> (fifth-generation)</td><br/>
 <td>&zwnj;iPad mini&zwnj; (sixth-generation)</td><br/>
 <td>&zwnj;iPad mini&zwnj; (sixth-generation)</td><br/>
 </tr><br/>
 <tr><br/>
 <td>&zwnj;iPad&zwnj; (sixth-, seventh-, eighth-, ninth-, and tenth-generation)</td><br/>
 <td></td><br/>
 <td>&zwnj;iPad&zwnj; (tenth-generation)</td><br/>
 </tr><br/>
</table><br/>
<div class="clear"></div><br/>
<br/>
Simply put, if your &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; features a Lightning connector, it is only compatible with the first-generation &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj;, providing it has &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; support at all. It will not work with the second-generation &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; or the &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; with USB-C. If your &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; features a USB-C port, it is compatible with the second-generation &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; and the &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; with USB-C, except the tenth-generation &zwnj;iPad&zwnj;, which supports the first-generation &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; and the &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; with USB-C.<br/>
<br/>
It is worth noting that the first-generation &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; is only compatible with the tenth-generation &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; using a USB-C cable and USB-C to &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; Adapter. It is not possible to use the first-generation &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; this way with any other &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; model that has a USB-C port.<br/>
<br/>
All three &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; models feature "pixel-perfect" precision, low latency, and tilt sensitivity, but feature different designs, pairing and charging methods, pressure sensitivity capabilities, and more.<br/>

<div class="clear"></div><br/>
<br/>
<h3 id="first-generation_apple_pencil_vs._apple_pencil_with_usb-c">First-Generation Apple Pencil vs. Apple Pencil With USB-C</h3><br/>
Most users should choose the &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; with USB-C. For a price of just &#36;79, the &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; with USB-C provides a good balance of features with a more modern design. It also has the added advantage of being compatible with a wide range of models and will likely work with all new &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; models for many years to come.<br/>
<br/>
It is only worth opting for the first-generation &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; if you specifically want pressure-sensitivity for activities like illustration, since the &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; with USB-C does not have this feature. Buyers should be aware that this model comes at a &#36;20 premium, requires a USB-C to &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; Adapter with the tenth-generation &zwnj;iPad&zwnj;, and will not be compatible with any future &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; models. It also cannot be magnetically attached to an &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; for storage, features a larger and older design, and has a removable cap over the Lightning connector that's easy to lose.<br/>
<br/>
<h3 id="second-generation_apple_pencil_vs._apple_pencil_with_usb-c">Second-Generation Apple Pencil vs. Apple Pencil With USB-C</h3><br/>
If choosing between the second-generation &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; and the &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; with USB-C, the second-generation model is a better choice on account of its superior feature set, but this requires spending an additional &#36;50. Double-tap to change tools and pressure-sensitivity may be particularly useful additions for illustrators, while the easy pairing and charging on the side of an &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; provides a much better experience than a wired connection with a USB-C cable.<br/>
<br/>
If you have only basic needs for activities like handwriting notes and marking up documents, the &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; with USB-C is still a great option at a much more affordable price point. It even supports &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; hover on the latest &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; models. <div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-pencil/">Apple Pencil</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipad-accessories.139">iPad Accessories</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-pencil-buyers-guide/">Apple Pencil Buyer&#039;s Guide: Which Model Should You Choose?</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-pencil-buyers-guide-which-model-should-you-choose.2407987/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/M3-iPad-Feature-3.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-917548" /><br/>
The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/2022-ipad-pro/">2022 iPad Pro</a> was a minor update that added the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m2/">M2</a> chip, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-pencil/">Apple Pencil</a> hover, and specification upgrades like Wi-Fi 6E and Bluetooth 5.3 connectivity. The &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; as a whole has generally only seen relatively small updates in recent years, but rumors indicate that the next-generation ‌&zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj;‌ will be the first major update to the product since 2018, introducing "<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/27/new-ipad-pro-and-redesigned-magic-keyboard/">fundamental changes</a>."<br/>
<br/>
The next-generation &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; models are currently expected <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/07/07/ipad-pro-oled-display-mass-production-early-2024/">enter mass production in early 2024</a>, with launch following in the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/27/new-ipad-pro-and-redesigned-magic-keyboard/">spring or summer</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<h3>Refreshed Design</h3><br/>
The &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; has retained the same design through four successive generations since 2018. Major changes to the device next year are likely to include design changes, but whether they will consist of minor tweaks or an outright overhaul is yet to be seen. Earlier rumors suggested that a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/04/ipad-pro-2022-wireless-charging-capabilities/">glass back</a> could come to a future &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; model, which would be a major design change for the product, but it is not clear if this is expected to arrive next year.<br/>
<br/>
Last year, the 10th-generation <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> became the first-ever &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; model to feature a landscape front-facing camera orientation, a much more natural placement for video calls when using a Magic Keyboard. Rumors <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/24/rumor-ipad-pro-horizontal-cameras-apple-logo/">dating back to 2021</a> have suggested that the relocated front-facing camera is also headed to the &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj;. Such a change would likely also require different placement of the &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj;, since the wireless charging components for the accessory are currently located where the camera would move to.<br/>
<br/>
<h3>M3 Chip</h3><br/>
The next-generation &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; is expected to feature Apple's upcoming M3 chip to deliver improved performance and efficiency.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/12/m3-feature-black.jpg" alt="" width="1810" height="1018" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-827879" /><br/>
The M3 chip is highly likely to be based on the A17 Pro chip, which is manufactured using TSMC's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/3nm/">3nm</a> node. The A17 Pro delivers 22% better performance over the A15 Bionic, the chip that &zwnj;M2&zwnj; is based on. As such, it seems almost certain that the M3 chip will be able to deliver similar improvements.<br/>
<br/>
A tentpole feature of the A17 Pro is a completely redesigned GPU with hardware-accelerated ray-tracing, leading to dramatically improved gaming experiences. The M3 chip is likely to sport the same technology, significantly enhancing the &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj;'s graphics capabilities.<br/>
<br/>
<h3>4TB Storage Option</h3><br/>
Apple will offer next year's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/oled-ipad-pro/">OLED iPad Pro</a> models with a 4TB storage option, a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/04/ipad-pro-may-have-4tb-storage-option/">rumor</a> coming out of Asia claimed last month. Since 2021, the &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; has been available with 128GB, 256GB, 512GB, 1TB, or 2TB of storage.<br/>
<br/>
If Apple increases the maximum storage of its forthcoming &zwnj;OLED &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; Pro&zwnj; models to 4TB, it would likely also increase the base storage to 256GB to maintain five capacity categories, making all seventh-generation models capable of recording ProRes in 4K at 30fps.<br/>
<br/>
It is also worth noting that &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; RAM is variable based on storage capacity, so &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; models with 128GB, 256GB, or 512GB of storage come with 8GB of RAM, while &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; models with 1TB or 2TB of storage feature 16GB of RAM. Whether that means a 4TB &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; would feature 24GB or 32GB of RAM is unknown, but not improbable.<br/>
<br/>
<h3>OLED Display Technology</h3><br/>
OLED display technology is perhaps the most anticipated upgrade coming to the next-generation &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; models. The current 11-inch model features an LCD display, while the 12.9-inch model has a mini-LED display.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/07/iPad-Pro-OLED-Feature-2.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-853666" /><br/>
Apple already uses OLED displays on the Apple Watch and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>, but has yet to bring the technology to larger devices. OLED displays use less power, sport greater color accuracy, and provide much better and more consistent contrast than LCD displays. As a significant upgrade, the change will likely be very prominent in the Apple's marketing materials for the next-generation &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
<h3>Bigger Screens</h3><br/>
The new &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; models are also rumored to get <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/12/29/oled-ipads-2024/">display size increases</a> from 11- to 11.1-inches and 12.9- to 13-inches, facilitated by slimmer borders around the screen. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/05/ipad-pro-m1-feature.jpg" alt="" width="1780" height="1001" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-800056" /><br/>
This would allow the footprint of the devices to remain the same while increasing display size. The slight increases are unlikely to add any meaningful functionality to the device, but it would provide a more modern "all-screen" appearance.<br/>
<br/>
<h3>Higher Prices</h3><br/>
The more advanced OLED display technology in the next-generation models is expected to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/09/2024-oled-ipad-pro-starting-prices/">drive up the iPad Pro's price</a>, with current estimates starting at &#36;1,500 and &#36;1,800 for the 11-inch and 13-inch models, respectively. Pricing on the current 11-inch &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; starts at &#36;799, while the 12.9-inch &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; starts at &#36;1,099. Models with cellular connectivity are available for an additional &#36;200 over the base price for each storage tier.<br/>
<br/>
<h3>Improved Cameras</h3><br/>
The &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; has had the same 12-megapixel main rear camera with a ƒ/1.8 aperture since 2017. The 12-megapixel ultra wide camera with an ƒ/2.4 aperture and brighter True Tone flash have also remained the same since its introduction on the 2021 &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj;. Camera upgrades are <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/16/ipad-mini-7-rumored-to-feature-these-four-upgrades/">rumored for other future iPad models</a> with related hardware such as the seventh-generation <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-mini/">iPad mini</a>, so it follows that similar improvements are on the way for the &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
Since 2021, the &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; has also featured a 12-megapixel front-facing camera with an ƒ/2.4 aperture. With 2022's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-14/">iPhone 14</a> models, Apple introduced an upgraded 12-megapixel front-facing camera with an ƒ/1.9 aperture and autofocus. It seems plausible that this hardware could be ready to trickle down to the &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; in its next incarnation.<br/>
<br/>
The current &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; Pros support Smart HDR 4, so an upgrade to Smart HDR 5 is likely. The Photonic Engine and other iPhone-only photography and videography features could also make their way to the next &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
<h3>New Connector</h3><br/>
A <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/08/10/two-new-connectors-coming-to-ipad-pro/">rumor from last year</a> suggested that a future &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; model will feature two new four-pin connectors.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/04/iPad-Pro-Feature-Orange.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1407" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-794590" /><br/>
Citing "reliable sources in China," the report claimed that upcoming &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; models will feature a new connector with four pins on the top and bottom side edges. This distinguishes them from the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/smart-connector/">Smart Connector</a>, which has three pins and is used to connect accessories such as the Magic Keyboard, and the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe-battery-pack/">MagSafe</a> 3 connector, which has five pins and is used for more convenient charging on Mac laptops. As a result, this appeared to be a totally new kind of interface, but its purpose is unknown.<br/>
<br/>
<em><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/macotakara-jp/">Mac Otakara</a></em> suggested that the new connectors may be used to help power peripherals connected to the Thunderbolt port, leveraging the DriverKit support added in iPadOS 16, but it is otherwise unclear what the connectors are for or why there would need to be two of them on different sides of the device. Whether this rumor still holds is also unknown since it mainly related to last year's model, but some sort of new connector in addition to the &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj;'s single Thunderbolt port is not out of the question.<br/>
<br/>
<h3>Wireless Charging</h3><br/>
In 2022, it was reported that Apple was <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/04/ipad-pro-2022-wireless-charging-capabilities/">testing a new iPad Pro with a glass back</a> to enable wireless charging capabilities. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/01/iPad-Pro-Big-Ol-Logo-Orange.jpg" alt="" width="1398" height="786" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-833305" /><br/>
A <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/01/14/ipad-pro-glass-apple-logo-prototype-report/">subsequent report</a> suggested that Apple may have ultimately scrapped the glass back design after testing due to concerns over breakability. Citing sources familiar with Apple's design plans, the report claimed that Apple has developed &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; prototypes with a larger Apple logo made of glass, which would still allow for wireless charging. One of the prototypes was said to feature &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; with stronger magnets than on the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; to prevent accidental damage, and it was also said to support faster wireless charging speeds compared to &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; on the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
There is no guarantee that the &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; with a glass back or Apple logo will ever be released, but rumors do seem to agree that Apple has extensively explored some kind of wireless charging solution for the &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj;, meaning that it is a firm possibility for the next-generation.<br/>
<br/>
<h3>Reverse Wireless Charging</h3><br/>
Apple is rumored to be working on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/04/ipad-pro-2022-wireless-charging-capabilities/">reverse wireless charging</a> for the new ‌&zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj;‌, which would allow users to charge their iPhones, AirPods, and other accessories by laying them on the back of the ‌&zwnj;iPad&zwnj;‌. Apple has also <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/05/apple-researching-wireless-charging-ecosystem/">filed patents</a> related to this feature, but its presence is almost certainly contingent on standard wireless charging being present on the device.<br/>
<br/>
<h3>Redesigned Magic Keyboard</h3><br/>
According to <em>Bloomberg</em>'s <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a>, Apple is planning a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/27/new-ipad-pro-and-redesigned-magic-keyboard/">complete revamp</a> of its Magic Keyboard accessory for the &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; that makes the device more laptop-like. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2018/11/m1-ipad-pro-magic-keyboards.jpg" alt="" width="2400" height="1350" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-795764" /><br/>
The updated version of the Magic Keyboard for &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; will offer a larger trackpad, addressing criticisms of the current model, and "makes the &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; look even more like a laptop than the current setup." The area around the keyboard itself will apparently be <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/03/gurman-new-ipad-magic-keyboard-to-feature-aluminum/">made of aluminum</a>, resembling the top case of MacBooks, to provide a sturdier structure.<br/>
<br/>
The exterior shell of the keyboard will retain the silicone cover material used on the current model and a single USB-C port. Gurman mused that the redesign using more premium materials could lead Apple to raise the accessory's &#36;299 price point.<br/>
<br/>
The Weibo leaker known as <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/16/ipad-mini-7-rumored-to-feature-these-four-upgrades/">"Instant Digital" claims</a> that the next-generation Magic Keyboard will also be 100% carbon neutral thanks to its redesign and use of different materials. Last month, Apple unveiled its first carbon neutral products: The aluminium <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch/">Apple Watch Series 9</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch-se/">Apple Watch SE</a> when paired with a new Sport Loop, as well as the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch-ultra/">Apple Watch Ultra 2</a> when paired with a new Trail Loop or Alpine Loop. The company plans for all of its products to be carbon neutral by 2030.<br/>
<br/>
<h3>Third-Generation Apple Pencil</h3><br/>
The second-generation &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; is now over five years old, sparking speculation about what the third-generation may have to offer and whether it will emerge with the next &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; models.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/10/m2-ipad-pro-apple-pencil-hover.jpeg" alt="" width="1280" height="596" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-869663" /><br/>
In March 2021, the leaker known as "Mr. White" shared an image purporting to depict a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/03/new-apple-pencil-allegedly-leaks/">next-generation Apple Pencil prototype</a> that featured a shorter design, glossy finish, and a larger, deeper tip. Apple was believed to have worked on a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/13/apple-working-on-smaller-apple-pencil/">smaller Apple Pencil</a> designed for the &zwnj;iPad mini&zwnj;, as well as a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/16/apple-planned-iphone-apple-pencil/">&#36;49 model for the iPhone</a>, but both products never emerged and are said to have been canceled entirely.<br/>
<br/>
More recently, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/02/apple-pencil-3-could-feature-magnetic-tips/">multiple rumors</a> suggested that the third-generation will include range of interchangeable magnetic tips to emulate different drawing styles. Following the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/17/new-apple-pencil-with-usb-c-announced/">launch of the &#36;79 Apple Pencil with USB-C</a>, it is unclear if this rumor still stands. Nevertheless, it is inevitable that the second-generation &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; will at some point be replaced by a newer model, and the launch of updated &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; models seems like the optimal time to showcase such an accessory.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/18/2024-ipad-pro-what-to-expect/">2024 iPad Pro: 12 Rumors About What to Expect</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/2024-ipad-pro-12-rumors-about-what-to-expect.2407985/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Canadian company <a href="http://monos.com">Monos</a> recently gave me the opportunity to review its <a href="http://monos.com/products/metro-backpack">Metro Backpack</a>, which is suitable for carrying a MacBook and other Apple products. Below, I have shared some details and thoughts on the backpack's design and utility.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/Monos-Metro-Backpack-1.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="1200" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-917624" /><br/>
Monos offers the Metro Backpack in nylon and vegan leather finishes in a variety of colors. I chose the vegan leather option in a Saddle Tan color, which is regularly priced at &#36;230 in the U.S., but has occasionally gone on sale for less.<br/>
<br/>
Overall, I find the backpack to both look and feel very premium, with quality materials complemented by nice stitching. Monos says the backpack uses entirely vegan materials, including felt made from recycled plastic bottles. The vegan leather is said to be made from an "ultra-microfiber" material with water and scratch resistance.<br/>
<br/>
The backpack has adjustable shoulder straps with the same vegan leather finish, and in my experience it has been comfortable to wear.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/Metro-Backpack-3.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-917629" /><br/>
The backpack features a large main compartment with two interior pockets, a zippered pouch, and a sleeve for holding an iPad, chargers and cables, books, pens, and other items. Beside the main compartment is a slimmer compartment with a separate zipper that is designed to hold a MacBook or other laptop for quick access. There is also a waterproof compartment that Monos says is ideal for items like shoes or a wet rain jacket.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/Metro-Backpack-2.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-917627" /><br/>
On the front, there is a smaller purse that can be detached from the backpack, which I think is a convenient two-in-one solution. Inside the purse, there is a zippered pocket with a translucent window, two other pockets that can fit items like a MacBook charger or a power bank, and a removable carabiner for use with keys and more.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/Metro-Backpack-4.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-917633" /><br/>
On the back, there is a pocket with a magnetic snap closure designed to hold an iPhone, passport, wallet, and other smaller valuables. There is also a strap on the back that allows the backpack to be secured to a suitcase handle while traveling.<br/>
<br/>
All in all, I like the premium feel and the versatility of the Metro Backpack compared to some other backpacks with cheaper materials and fewer compartments. If you are willing to spend over &#36;200 on a backpack for your Apple gear, the Metro Backpack is a great choice in my opinion, but it will not be for everyone at that price point.<br/>
<br/>
You can <a href="http://monos.com/products/metro-backpack">order the Metro Backpack on the Monos website</a>. The company currently ships to the United States, Canada, Australia, and the United Kingdom, and it also sells matching bags, luggage, and other travel items.<br/>
<br/>
<small>Note: Monos provided MacRumors with the Metro Backpack for this review. No other compensation was received.</small><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/review/monos-metro-backpack/">Review: Metro Backpack by Monos Features a Dedicated MacBook Compartment</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/review-metro-backpack-by-monos-features-a-dedicated-macbook-compartment.2407984/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today introduced new firmware for the the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/">AirPods Pro</a> 2 with Lightning port and the &zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj; 2 with USB-C port. The new firmware is 6A305, up from <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/10/apple-releases-new-airpods-pro-2-firmware-2/">the 6A303 update</a> for the &zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj; 2 that came out on October 10.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-867348" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/09/airpods-pro-2-pink.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" /><br/>
Apple does not provide details on what features might be included in the refreshed firmware, so it is unclear what's new. Apple added multiple new &zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj; 2 features in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a> such as Adaptive Audio, Conversation Awareness, and Personalized Volume, so there may be additional refinements to those updates.<br/>
<br/>
Apple does not offer instructions on how to upgrade AirPods software, but firmware is generally installed over-the-air while the ‌‌AirPods‌‌ are connected to an iOS device. Putting the ‌‌‌‌‌AirPods‌‌‌‌‌ in the case, connecting the ‌‌‌‌‌AirPods‌‌‌‌‌ to a power source, and then pairing the ‌‌‌‌‌AirPods‌‌‌‌‌ to an iOS device or Mac should force the update.<br/>
<br/>
You can check your ‌‌‌‌‌‌‌&zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj;‌‌‌‌‌‌‌ firmware by following these steps:<br/>
<ul><br/>
 	<li>Connect your ‌‌‌‌‌‌&zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj;‌‌‌‌‌‌ to your iOS device.</li><br/>
 	<li>Open the Settings app.</li><br/>
 	<li>Tap General.</li><br/>
 	<li>Tap About.</li><br/>
 	<li>Tap ‌‌‌‌‌AirPods‌‌‌‌‌.</li><br/>
 	<li>Look at the number next to "Firmware Version."</li><br/>

		<description><![CDATA[At least five employees who worked for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a> in China have been fired for inappropriate conduct with developers and consultants, according to a report from <em><a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/apple-fired-app-store-staff-after-finding-improper-dealings-with-game-developers">The Information</a></em>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/App-Store-Blue-Banner-Chinese-Flag-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-917631" /><br/>
&zwnj;App Store&zwnj; employees with review and editorial roles are not supposed to meet with developers, but an internal audit raised suspicions about half a dozen workers, leading to an investigation. Apple found that the employees had accepted free meals and nightclub outings from developers and consultants that operate businesses claiming they can get games featured in the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
The employees involved did not approve apps and would not have been able to get apps added to the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; or removed from the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj;, but they did have the power to feature &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; apps to get them more views. It is not clear if the employees featured the apps of developers that they interacted with inappropriately.<br/>
<br/>
In a statement, an Apple spokesperson said that Apple expects employees to abide by its business conduct policies.<br/>
<blockquote>"Without commenting on the specific allegations of this report, Apple expects its employees worldwide to abide by its very strong ethics and business conduct policies. We thoroughly investigate reports of improper conduct and when appropriate will not hesitate to take immediate action up to and including termination."</blockquote><br/>
According to former Apple employees, Apple aims to keep &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; employees and developers separate, and it also tries to limit interactions of different &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; departments to prevent confidential developer information from being shared and to limit the influence that developers have over employees.<br/>
<br/>
<em>The Information</em>'s report also details the firing of an &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; employee who allegedly sexually assaulted an employee at Mihoyo, the Chinese developer behind mobile game Genshin Impact.

		<description><![CDATA[Apple will not release a second-generation version of the AirTag until 2025, according to <a href="https://twitter.com/mingchikuo/status/1714685670210351166">Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo</a>. Mass production on the accessory has reportedly been delayed until 2025, which has pushed back Apple's target launch timeline. Back in August, Kuo had said that mass production would kick off in the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/02/kuo-new-airtag-production-late-2024/">fourth quarter of 2024</a>, suggesting a late 2024 or early 2025 launch.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/AirTag-2-Mock-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-917578" /><br/>
According to Kuo, the AirTag 2 will be part of a new spatial computing ecosystem that Apple is building, with the Vision Pro serving as the core to integrate other devices. Kuo previously said that he believes the AirTag will integrate with the Vision Pro headset, but he still has not given much insight into what that means. <br/>
<br/>
There is a possibility that the Ultra Wideband chip in the AirTag could be used for relaying positional information to the Vision Pro in some capacity, but just how Apple will use the AirTag with the Vision Pro remains to be seen. <br/>
<br/>
We've heard little about a second-generation AirTag at this point, and there's no word on what Apple might include in terms of design changes, form factor updates, or feature additions. <br/>
<br/>
A new AirTag would likely incorporate Apple's second-generation Ultra Wideband chip that debuted in the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a> models, allowing for even more precise tracking indoors. <div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/">Ming-Chi Kuo</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airtags/">AirTags</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/airtags.232">AirTags</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/18/airtag-2-postponed-until-2025/">Kuo: AirTag 2 Postponed Until 2025</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/kuo-airtag-2-postponed-until-2025.2407973/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's rumored foldable <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> is now in "intensive development" and could be announced as soon as late 2024, according to <em><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/digitimes-com/">DigiTimes</a></em>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/10/Foldable-iPhone-2023-Feature-Blue.jpg" alt="" width="1458" height="820" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-797663" /><br/>
In a <a href="https://www.digitimes.com/news/a20231018PD207/pc-ce-apple-foldable-device-ipad-mobile-devices.html">paywalled report</a> that cites supply chain sources, <em>&zwnj;DigiTimes&zwnj;</em> outlines how Apple is now working with suppliers on foldable &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; development, ahead of small-scale production scheduled for the end of 2024. The Taiwanese publication believes that this indicates Apple could announce the device in late 2024 or early 2025 if progress remains steady.<br/>
<br/>
Apple has apparently been working on foldable products for four years and continuously made design changes in this time, planning to release a foldable &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; before working on a foldable <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>. Apple chose to focus on the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; because it makes up a comparatively small proportion of the company's sales, meaning that potential issues are easier to manage and less impactful.<br/>
<br/>
The company has reportedly not yet finalized the design of the foldable &zwnj;iPad&zwnj;. Initially, Apple's product design team led the project but this role is now said to have shifted to the procurement department to bring down costs. Apple's main objective at this stage is to achieve a more cost-effective design, motivating contentious changes to the device.<br/>
<br/>
A main issue is said to be the device's panel and hinges, with Apple being particularly concerned about the display creasing. The company is purportedly looking to Samsung and LG to provide a display that mitigates the creasing effect using mechanical design solutions. Apple is seemingly able to obtain sufficient supply of the device's hinge, but is still seeking a design that is more cost-effective and easy to mass produce, which could require further simplification and reduction in the number of parts.<br/>
<br/>
Mass production of Apple's first foldable is expected to commence in 2025. <em>&zwnj;DigiTimes&zwnj;</em> believes the foldable could boost &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; shipments, sparking an uptick in otherwise shrinking global tablet sales.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/digitimes-com/">DigiTimes</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/foldable-ipad/">Foldable iPad</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/18/foldable-ipad-now-in-intensive-development-could-be-announced-as-soon-as-late-2024/">Foldable iPad Now in &#039;Intensive Development,&#039; Could Be Announced as Soon as Next Year</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/foldable-ipad-now-in-intensive-development-could-be-announced-as-soon-as-next-year.2407934/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[MacBook sales have dropped significantly amid Apple's decision to launch no new Macs for the remainder of 2023, Apple supply chain analyst <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/">Ming-Chi Kuo</a> reports.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/MacBook-Air-15-Inch-Feature-Teal.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="894" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-898577" /><br/>
In a new <a href="https://medium.com/@mingchikuo/4q23-macbook供應鏈出貨顯著衰退25-35-yoy-需警戒同時是macbook關鍵供應商之ai股票-4q23-macbook-supply-chain-shipments-9cdc1c26b65a">post on Medium</a>, Kuo claimed that MacBook sales as a whole are expected to be around 30% lower this year compared to 2022, reducing to about 17 million units. He highlighted that demand for the 15-inch <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/">MacBook Air</a> has dropped substantially following the end of the back-to-school period, revising shipment forecasts down by approximately 20% or more. <br/>
<br/>
In September, Kuo <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/08/kuo-first-m3-macbooks-unlikely-2023/">reported</a> that Apple is unlikely to release any new MacBook models with the M3 chip this year. With no new product launches for the rest of 2023, Kuo now expects MacBook shipment momentum to be significantly lower than in previous seasons. He added that declining work-from-home demand and the waning appeal of Apple silicon and mini-LED displays are also driving MacBook sales down.<br/>
<br/>
Kuo believes that one reason for Apple choosing to withhold the launch of any products is to clear inventory ahead of new releases next year. Apple apparently expects the M3 series of chips to boost Mac sales in 2024, but Kuo says this is yet to be seen.<br/>
<br/>
In a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/27/kuo-2024-macbooks-ipads-3nm/">previous report</a>, Kuo seemed skeptical of new MacBooks with M3 chips boosting sales. He warned that demand for these devices might still be "below expectations" due to a "lack of growth drivers." Kuo was essentially saying that Apple will no longer have the growth catalysts that it did over the past few years, such as a pandemic-driven work-from-home boost in demand or the newness of Apple silicon, which spurred many customers to upgrade from Intel-based Macs. However, given Mac and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> sales already significantly declined in 2023, Apple will at least have more favorable year-over-year sales comparisons in 2024.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/">Ming-Chi Kuo</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/18/kuo-macbook-sales-down-amid-no-new-products/">Kuo: MacBook Sales Down 30% Amid No New Products for Remainder of 2023</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/kuo-macbook-sales-down-30-amid-no-new-products-for-remainder-of-2023.2407932/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>
