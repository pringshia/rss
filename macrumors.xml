		<description><![CDATA[Things are firming up for a big Halloween week for Apple, with the company's next operating system updates reportedly coming early in the week and hardware launches coming a few days later.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/10/top-stories-12oct2024.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-970626" /><br/>
Ahead of those hardware launches, we've recently seen what appears to be one of the most significant physical product leaks in years, while some of the new features in Apple's recent software updates have gained attention for their utility, so read on below for all the details on these stories and more!<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Apple Plans to Release iOS 18.1 With Apple Intelligence on October 28</h2><br/>
iOS 18.1 has been in beta testing since before iOS 18.0 was released, as Apple has been working hard on refining the first Apple Intelligence features that will be included in the update, and it appears we now have a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/06/apple-to-release-ios-18-1-on-october-28/">release date for iOS 18.1 and related updates: Monday, October 28</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/08/Generic-iOS-18.1-Feature-Real-Mock.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-963325" /><br/>
Apple Intelligence features will be seeing a gradual rollout, so make sure to check out our overview of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ios-18-1-apple-intelligence/">everything we're expecting to see for Apple Intelligence in iOS 18.1</a>, iPadOS 18.1, and macOS Sequoia 15.1, plus a look at upcoming Apple Intelligence features that <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence-features-coming-later/">will be arriving in later updates</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Apple Potentially Facing Worst Leak Since iPhone 4 Was Left in a Bar</h2><br/>
Over the past week or two, there have been growing claims of leaked units of the upcoming M4 MacBook Pro, and despite the box depicting the same wallpaper as on the current models, it's appearing increasingly likely that these leaked units are legitimate.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/10/Alleged-M4-MacBook-Pro-Leak-Video.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="895" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-969683" /><br/>
Following early blurry photos of the claimed box for one of the machines, a Russian YouTube channel has <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/06/alleged-m4-macbook-pro-unboxing-video/">shared an unboxing video for the M4 MacBook Pro</a>, revealing a number of improved specs compared to the current M3-based model. Aside from apparent <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/07/m4-mac-chip-benchmarks/">faster speeds</a>, RAM and port improvements, and the Space Black color option potentially trickling down to the base M4 version of the machine, it appears the machine <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/08/macbook-pro-m4-two-external-displays/">may also support two external displays</a> in addition to the internal display for the first time on a base M-series chip.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Gurman: Apple to Launch First M4 Macs and Potentially iPad Mini 7 on November 1</h2><br/>
So when can we expect that M4 MacBook Pro and other new hardware to launch? <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman says at least some of the rumored products are <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/06/apple-to-launch-new-m4-macs-nov-1/">scheduled to launch on Friday, November 1</a>, potentially following an introduction earlier that week.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/M4-Real-Feature-Red.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-950311" /><br/>
In addition to a full range of 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models variously configured with M4, M4 Pro, and M4 Max chips, we're also expecting a redesigned Mac mini with M4 and M4 Pro chip options, an M4 iMac, and a seventh-generation iPad mini, though it's not confirmed if all of these will be available simultaneously on November 1.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Apple Watch Users Report Vitals App Detecting Illness Before Symptoms Appear</h2><br/>
There's a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/07/apple-watch-vitals-detects-illness-before-symptoms/">new Vitals app in watchOS 11 that is impressing some users</a> with its ability to potentially detect illnesses up to several days before noticeable symptoms appear.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/watchos-11-vitals.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-957264" /><br/>
The Vitals app brings together a number of key health metrics that are measured during sleep, and it can notify when one or more of these readings are outliers compared to your typical ranges, which can be a sign that you are getting sick.<br/>
<br/>
It won't pick up every illness and it's not able to diagnose or help treat any specific illnesses, but it appears it may be able to provide a bit of warning in some cases to help users be more aware of changes in their health.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>iOS 18: Send Messages Without a Wi-Fi or Cellular Connection</h2><br/>
With a pair of major hurricanes striking the southeastern United States in recent weeks, taking down power lines and cell service, a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/send-messages-without-wi-fi-cellular-iphone/">new iOS 18 feature is gaining particular notice: Messages via satellite</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/iOS-18-Messages-via-Satellite.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-955787" /><br/>
While iPhone 14 and newer models have already been able to take advantage of Emergency SOS and roadside assistance via satellite, iOS 18 expands those satellite capabilities to include standard iMessages and SMS texts, offering a way to get in touch with friends and family even when traditional networks are unavailable.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Apple Says Final iPod Nano and iPod Shuffle Models Are Now Obsolete</h2><br/>
Apple discontinued the final iPod nano and iPod shuffle models way back in 2017, and that means <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/08/obsolete-ipods/">Apple now considers them obsolete</a> and thus ineglible for repairs at Apple Stores and Apple Authorized Service Providers.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/09/ipod_nano_2015_feature.jpg" alt="" width="1552" height="873" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-757305" /><br/>
Both the iPod shuffle and the iPod nano were introduced in 2005 as smaller, cheaper music players in Apple's iPod lineup, and they both saw significant form factor evolutions over their lifespans with the final models debuting in mid-2015 before being discontinued two years later.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[There have been multiple signs suggesting that Apple's mixed reality Vision Pro headset is struggling to take off, both due to the super high price and the heavy design that limits the amount of time it can be worn for most people. What does the Vision Pro's floundering mean for Apple's work on future virtual and augmented reality projects?<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/01/Apple-Glasses-Triad-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-777635" /><br/>
<h2>Vision Pro Interest</h2><br/>
Interest in the Vision Pro was high in February when the device first launched because it was an all-new product category for Apple, but that didn't last. The Vision Pro is indisputably impressive, and it is mind blowing to watch a butterfly flit by so closely it feels like you can reach out and touch it, or to see the rough skin of an elephant as it walks right by you, but the magic quickly wears off for most.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/vision-pro-headset-1.jpg" alt="" width="2698" height="1518" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-898460" /><br/>
Early reviews found the Vision Pro hard to wear for a long enough period of time to incorporate it into a real workflow, and it was hard to find a use case that justified the &#36;3,500 price tag. <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24054862/apple-vision-pro-review-vr-ar-headset-features-price">The Verge</a></em>'s Nilay Patel found the Vision Pro to be uncomfortably isolating, and <em><a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/apple-vision-pro-review-39f2d82e">The Wall Street Journal</a></em>'s Joanna Stern got nauseous every time she watched the limited amount of Apple Immersive Video content available. Reviewers agreed that watching TV and movies was one of the best use cases, but that makes for an expensive TV that can't be watched with anyone else.<br/>
<br/>
Months later, sentiment hasn't changed much. There was a lot of demand at Apple Stores when the Vision Pro launched, and long lines of people wanted to give it a try. Once the demo was over, though, interest fell. As early as April, there were reports that enthusiasm about the Vision Pro <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/22/apple-vision-pro-customer-interest-dying-down/">had dropped significantly</a>, and by July, there were <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/11/apple-vision-pro-under-500000-sales-this-year/">reports of waning sales</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/Apple-Vision-Pro-with-battery-Feature-Blue-Magenta.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-898550" /><br/>
At MacRumors, a few of us bought a Vision Pro at launch, and those headsets are tucked away in their cases and essentially not pulled out much at all anymore, except to sometimes watch Apple's latest Immersive Video or to update to new visionOS software. MacRumors videographer Dan Barbera uses his Vision Pro once a week or so for watching content, but only for about two hours because it's painful to continue use after that point. MacRumors editor in chief Eric Slivka and I haven't found a compelling use case, and there's no content appealing enough for even weekly use.<br/>
<br/>
I still can't wear the Vision Pro for more than two hours or so because it's too uncomfortable, and I'm prone to motion sickness so it sometimes makes me feel queasy if there's too much movement. The biggest reason I don't use the Vision Pro, though, is that I don't want to shut out what's around me. Sure, it's great for watching movies, TV shows, or YouTube videos on a screen that looks like it's 100 feet tall, but to do that, I have to isolate myself. I can't watch with other people, and I feel genuinely guilty when my cat comes over for attention and I'm distracted by my headset.<br/>
<br/>
Watching movies on the Vision Pro is not a better experience than using the 65-inch TV in front of my couch. I am a gamer, but there aren't many interesting games, and a lot of the content that's available feels like I'm playing a mobile game in a less intuitive way. Using it as a display for my Mac is the best use case I've found, but it's limited to a single display and it's not enough of an improvement over my two display setup to justify being uncomfortable while I work.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/vision-pro-macbook.jpg" alt="" width="3022" height="1698" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-930147" /><br/>
Beyond our own experiences with the Vision Pro, MacRumors site traffic indicates a lack of interest in the headset. When we publish a story about the Vision Pro, people don't read it. I wrote a Vision Pro story about the first short film on the headset just yesterday, for example, and it was our lowest traffic article for the day. It probably wasn't worth my time to even do, and that's not an isolated incident.<br/>
<br/>
There <em>are</em> enterprise use cases for Vision Pro, and some people out there who do love the headset, so it does have some promise, and Apple has been marketing it to businesses. Some examples, from Apple and others:<br/>
<ul><br/>
 	<li><strong>Porsche</strong> - Porsche engineers use the Vision Pro to visualize car data in real time.</li><br/>
 	<li><strong>KLM</strong> - KLM Airlines is using the Vision Pro for training technicians on new engine models.</li><br/>
 	<li><strong>Law enforcement</strong> - Police departments in California are testing Vision Pro for surveillance work.</li><br/>
 	<li><strong>Medicine</strong> - A medical team in the UK used the Vision Pro for two spinal surgeries. Doctors in India also reportedly use it for laparoscopic surgeries, and an orthopedic surgeon in Brazil used it during a shoulder surgery. UCSD has been testing the use of Vision Pro apps for minimally invasive surgery.</li><br/>
<li><strong>Science</strong> - MIT students wrote an app to control a robot using the Vision Pro's gesture support.</li><br/>
</ul><br/>
<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tim-cook/">Tim Cook</a> said in May that "half" of Fortune 100 companies bought a Vision Pro, but whether those Vision Pro headsets are actually in use and what for is unknown.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Confusion Over What's Next</h2><br/>
With Vision Pro sales coming in under what Apple expected, we've seen some confusing rumors about what Apple's next move will be. There were initially rumors that Apple was working on two new versions of the Vision Pro, one that's cheaper and one that's a direct successor to the current model.<br/>
<br/>
In April, <em>Bloomberg</em>'s <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a> said Apple would not launch a new version of the Vision Pro <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/29/no-apple-vision-pro-2-before-end-of-2026/">prior to the end of 2026</a>, with Apple struggling to find ways to bring down the cost of the headset.<br/>
<br/>
In June, <em>The Information</em> said Apple had suspended work on a second-generation Vision Pro to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/18/apple-suspends-work-on-vision-pro-2/">focus on a cheaper model</a>. Later that same month, Gurman said that Apple might make the next Vision Pro reliant on a tethered <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> or Mac, which could drop costs, and he said a cheaper headset could come out as early as the end of 2025.<br/>
<br/>
In late September, Apple analyst <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/">Ming-Chi Kuo</a> said Apple would begin production on a new version of the Vision Pro in the second half of 2025, presumably for a late 2025 launch. He claims the most substantial upgrade will be a new M5 chip for notably better computing power, with the specifications, design, and price to stay largely the same. This is in contrast to a February rumor from Kuo that said Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/28/kuo-vision-pro-major-upgrades-unlikely-until-2027/">wouldn't release a new model</a> until 2027.<br/>
<br/>
None of these rumors are really on the same page, so Apple's next step in AR/VR development is unclear. Kuo is saying there will be a new Vision Pro with a faster chip at the end of 2025, while Gurman and <em>The Information</em> think we'll get a cheaper version of the headset. Even Apple might not yet have a clear decision on what's next, so we'll have to wait and see how the company's AR/VR strategy evolves.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>AR Smart Glasses</h2><br/>
Since before Apple came out with the Vision Pro, there have been rumors about work on lightweight augmented reality smart glasses. AR glasses are Apple's actual longterm goal, with the Vision Pro serving as a stepping stone. Apple CEO &zwnj;Tim Cook&zwnj; <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2017/08/01/apple-ceo-tim-cook-on-augmented-reality/">has talked about</a> Apple's interest in augmented reality extensively, calling it "big and profound," and something that people will eventually look back on and wonder how they <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/09/29/tim-cook-profound-impact-of-ar/">lived without it</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Apple wanted to release AR smart glasses as early as 2023 before delaying the project to 2025, but unfortunately, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/01/17/apple-glasses-postponed/">development was postponed</a> "indefinitely" in January 2023. According to Gurman, Apple stopped work because of technical difficulties, and there are some Apple employees that don't think Apple will ever ship AR glasses.<br/>
<br/>
Later in 2023, Gurman clarified that smart glasses were "at least" four years <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/18/apple-ar-glasses-still-at-least-four-years-away/">away from launching</a>. Apple realized while developing the Vision Pro that building AR glasses with sufficient power was not feasible. To work, the glasses would need to provide the full performance of an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; with a tenth of its power consumption to keep them from getting too warm. Apple's work on smart glasses receives "limited resources," with most development going toward the Vision Pro to lay the foundation for a future where the AR technology will work.<br/>
<br/>
Serious development on standalone AR glasses is postponed at the current time, so it's not quite clear when we're going to reach a point where hardware miniaturization and chip efficiency improvements will allow for AR glasses as Apple envisions them.<br/>
<br/>
Way back in 2017, Apple CEO &zwnj;Tim Cook&zwnj; said that the technology doesn't exist to do AR smart glasses "in a quality way," and that doesn't appear to have changed since then. It will likely be close to the end of the decade before we start hearing serious reports about Apple's work on augmented reality glasses.<br/>
<br/>
If Apple can continue to fund new versions of the Vision Pro and make improvements to that product line like it did with the Apple Watch, the future looks promising for a lightweight set of glasses that combine the power of the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; with the wonder of the Vision Pro.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Meta's Smart Glasses</h2><br/>
Last month, Facebook parent company Meta showed off its Orion augmented reality smart glasses. The glasses have a super thick frame, but they look a lot more like regular glasses than any mixed reality headset on the market.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-968156" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/meta-ar-glasses-interface.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" /><em>Meta Orion</em></div><br/>
Meta's Orion glasses have been in development for more than five years, and Meta isn't ready to release them. They're still in a prototyping stage, but Meta is testing them with employees and select external audiences to "learn, iterate, and build" toward a consumer AR glasses product line. Meta's glasses aren't standalone, requiring a wristband for control and a compute puck that has to be in the room.<br/>
<br/>
It costs Meta <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24253908/meta-orion-ar-glasses-demo-mark-zuckerberg-interview">around &#36;10,000</a> to make one pair of the Orion glasses, so that gives us some context on the hurdles that Apple needs to overcome to get AR glasses to market. Meta can't sell the glasses at that price point, and it's likely going to be several years before they come down to a price low enough to entice consumers.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Something In-Between</h2><br/>
Meta also has Ray-Ban AI glasses that are affordable, but don't have any augmented reality capabilities. Apple has <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/25/apple-has-explored-smart-ring-and-glasses/">explored a similar product</a>, and there's a chance that we could get something like the Ray-Ban glasses in the future.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/10/meta-ray-bans.jpg" alt="" width="1724" height="970" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-968917" /><em>Meta's Ray-Ban Glasses</em></div><br/>
Apple could make simple glasses with a camera, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a> integration, and built-in speakers for listening to music, because speaker-equipped sunglasses have also caught on in recent years. Health capabilities could be included too. Right now Apple is still considering such a product, so it's not clear if it's something that will make it to an actual development stage.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>The Far Future</h2><br/>
If Apple does master AR smart glasses, technology could eventually come to a point where something even smaller is possible. &zwnj;Ming-Chi Kuo&zwnj; claimed in 2021 that Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/07/kuo-apple-ar-contact-lenses-2030s/">could release</a> augmented reality contact lenses in the 2030s, but that prediction is sounding unrealistic at a point when technology can't be miniaturized enough even for quality AR glasses.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/03/smart-contact-lens.jpeg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-787409" /><br/>

		<description><![CDATA[In iOS 18.1, there is a new option to set a "Primary" email address in the Settings app, which means it is easier to change the main email address associated with your Apple Account. The Primary email address is the one that is visible to other people when collaborating on and sharing documents, sending calendar invites, and more.<br/>
<br/>

Apple did not previously make it easy to change an Apple Account (or <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-id/">Apple ID</a>) email address, despite the fact that it is sometimes visible to other people. To change an Apple Account email before, you had to delete the email you were using, choose another, and go through a verification process.<br/>
<br/>
You can now change the email address and continue to use the prior email for login purposes right alongside the new primary. This setting also comes with an option to change an iCloud.com or me.com email address, so if you have an address you're not fond of, it can finally be swapped to something else.<br/>
<br/>
Prior to iOS 18.1, Apple did not allow users to delete, change, or turn off a primary <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/icloud/">iCloud</a> Mail address. You could set an alias and use that instead, but the primary email would still sometimes be visible to others. For those who have an embarrassing &zwnj;iCloud&zwnj; email address, there's now an option to change it entirely rather than relying on an alias.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Summaries and smart reply options aren't the flashiest of Apple Intelligence features, but these are capabilities that Apple is introducing in iOS 18.1 that have the potential to be useful for most people's day-to-day device usage.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/apple-intelligence-black.jpeg" alt="" width="1400" height="788" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-963902" /><br/>
<h2 id="summaries">Summaries</h2><br/>
Summaries are available across the operating system and can be used in different ways for apps, notifications, emails, and more.<br/>
<br/>
<h3 id="mail_and_messages">Mail and Messages</h3><br/>
In your email inbox in the Mail app, you'll see an AI summary of the main content of the email message, so you can tell whether it's important at a glance. You don't get a lot of information, but it's enough to give context when the title doesn't unveil what an email is about. When you tap into an email, you can use the "Summarize" option at the top to get an overview. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/summarize-mail.jpg" alt="mail" width="2898" height="2796" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-968365" /><br/>
You'll see summaries of incoming messages on the Lock Screen so you can decide whether it's important to respond. It's particularly useful for long messages, because it's good at pulling out the most important bits. You can also see summaries of unread messages right in the Messages app. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/08/ios-18-messages-summary.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-960714" /><br/>
You can turn off Messages summaries by going to Settings > Apps > Messages and toggling off Summarize Messages. Turn off Mail summaries the same way, but in the Mail section.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="notifications">Notifications</h2><br/>
For almost all of your notifications, Apple Intelligence can group them up and give you a short, one-sentence summary of what's in them. Tapping expands the stack so you can see everything individually.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/08/summarize-notification-previews.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-962909" /><br/>
Notification summaries work for built-in apps like Messages, and also your third-party apps. Apple Intelligence tries to pick out what's most relevant. For messaging apps or email, it'll give a short summary of one or two messages, while aggregates like camera motion notifications are grouped up so you can see which areas had motion activations at a glance.<br/>
<br/>
Notification summaries are automatic when you have Apple Intelligence on, but if you want to turn them off, you can do so by opening up the Settings app, going to Notifications, and turning off Summarize Previews. You can disable the feature entirely or on a per-app basis.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="safari">Safari</h2><br/>
Safari supports a new Apple Intelligence Summary feature that lets you get an overview of webpages or articles. If you see a purple sparkle on the URL bar, you can tap it to view a summary.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/ios-18-1-safari-summarize.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-960226" /><br/>
Summaries are technically part of Reader Mode, but you don't always have to enter into Reader Mode to view one. Summaries show up automatically for longer articles, but if you're not seeing one, tap into Reader Mode and then tap on the Summarize button.<br/>
<br/>
You can also select any text anywhere in Safari, then tap on Writing Tools, and choose Summary to get a summary of your highlighted text. This summarize feature <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence-writing-tools/">is part of Writing Tools</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Summaries tend to be a paragraph at most, so you're not always going to get a full picture of what's in an article. It's more of an overview to let you know whether it's worth reading.<br/>
<h2 id="notes">Notes</h2><br/>
In the Notes app, you can select text and choose the Writing Tools Summary option just like you can in Safari, but there are also summaries created for recorded phone call transcripts and transcripts of voice memo recordings captured with the Notes app.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/08/ios-18-notes-transcript-summary.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-962315" /><br/>
In a note with a recording, tap into it and you'll see a "Summary" option at the top that you can choose to get a summary of a transcript. Note that phone call recording, voice memos in notes, and transcripts of those recordings are available to everyone. It's only the summary feature that's an Apple Intelligence feature.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="other_apps">Other Apps</h2><br/>
In all apps, you can select any text and use Writing Tools to generate a summary of that text, just like you can in Safari and Notes.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="smart_replies">Smart Replies</h2><br/>
Smart Replies are a feature in Mail and Messages, and you'll see them in the suggestions bar above the keyboard.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/ios-18-1-smart-replies.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-960207" /><br/>
Smart Replies can be useful when you're replying to a message that has a clear question in it, such as "Do you want to go to the movies tonight?" or "Did you see [insert popular TV show here] last night?"<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/ios-18-1-messages-smart-reply.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-960223" /><br/>
It is less useful for most other responses. Smart Replies don't seem to learn from individual tone or voice, and most of the time, the suggestions don't always sound like they came from a human. It tends to use a lot of "haha" responses and exclamation points, and when it's not suggesting haha as a reply, it's often rephrasing what the other person said, which is not generally how people respond to messages.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="how_useful_are_these_features">How Useful Are These Features?</h2><br/>
Smart Replies and other Apple Intelligence features are in beta right now, and will be released in a beta capacity, too. Summaries have room for improvement in terms of thoroughness, but the option is already useful, particularly when viewing notifications on the Lock Screen or scrolling through your email messages.<br/>
<br/>
Summaries for longer form content could stand to be more detailed, and right now, you're only going to get a high level overview.<br/>
<br/>
Smart Replies are of questionable use at the current time, and hopefully this is something that will get a lot better when the personal context <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a> features are released next year. Right now, Smart Replies can almost be more of an annoyance, but we are in the very early days of Apple Intelligence.<br/>
<h2 id="apple_intelligence_requirements">Apple Intelligence Requirements</h2><br/>
To use the summary and smart reply Apple Intelligence features, you need a device capable of Apple Intelligence. That includes the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a> Pro, the &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; Pro Max, any <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a> model, any <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> with an M-series chip, and any Mac with an M-series chip.<br/>
<br/>
Apple Intelligence features do not work on any other devices because of the processing power and memory required.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="release_date">Release Date</h2><br/>
Apple Intelligence is in the iOS 18.1, iPadOS 18.1, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sequoia/">macOS Sequoia</a> 15.1 betas at the current time. The betas are available to developers and public beta testers, and the updates are expected to see a release on Monday, October 28.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-18/">iPadOS 18</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-18.244">iOS 18</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-18.245">iPadOS 18</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence-smart-replies-summaries/">Apple Intelligence: What to Know About Summaries and Smart Replies</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-intelligence-what-to-know-about-summaries-and-smart-replies.2439845/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple sells two external displays, including the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/displays/">Pro Display XDR</a> and the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/studio-display/">Studio Display</a>, but neither has received hardware upgrades in years. In fact, the Pro Display XDR is nearly five years old, having been released all the way back in December 2019.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/hero-banner-displays.jpg" alt="" width="1723" height="969" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-930094" /><br/>
Below, we recap rumors about potential next-generation Pro Display XDR and Studio Display monitors, but nothing seems to be imminent.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Pro Display XDR</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/Pro-Display-XDR-Gray.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="840" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-930101" /><br/>
Released alongside the 2019 Mac Pro, the high-end Pro Display XDR features a 32-inch screen with LED backlighting, 6K resolution, a 60Hz refresh rate, P3 wide color, up to 1,600 nits of brightness, one Thunderbolt 3 port, and three USB-C ports. In the U.S., the monitor still starts at &#36;4,999, while the optional Pro Stand costs &#36;999 extra.<br/>
<br/>
In December 2022, <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman said Apple was working on an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/12/18/updated-pro-display-xdr-gurman/">updated version of the Pro Display XDR</a> with an Apple silicon chip, something the current model lacks. In the Studio Display, an A13 Bionic chip powers features such as Center Stage camera framing, spatial audio, and Siri voice commands. However, there have not been any recent rumors about a new Pro Display XDR, so it's unclear what Apple's current plans are.<br/>
<br/>
Additional features that customers are hoping for with the next Pro Display XDR include a built-in camera, speakers, and a higher refresh rate.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Studio Display</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/hero-banner-displays-studio-display.jpg" alt="" width="1723" height="969" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-930099" /><br/>
Apple released the Studio Display in March 2022, alongside the first Mac Studio. The monitor features a 27-inch LCD screen with 5K resolution, a 60Hz refresh rate, P3 wide color, up to 600 nits brightness, a built-in camera and speakers, one Thunderbolt 3 port, and three USB-C ports. In the U.S., the Studio Display continues to start at &#36;1,599, although the standard configuration is <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FApple-Studio-Display-Standard-Tilt-Adjustable%2Fdp%2FB09V3GZD32%2F">on sale on Amazon for &#36;1,349</a> as of writing.<br/>
<br/>
In his December 2022 report, Gurman said Apple was <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/12/18/updated-pro-display-xdr-gurman/">working on multiple new external monitors</a>, but he did not specifically mention a new Studio Display. In July 2023, Gurman said Apple's next-generation monitors could <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/07/03/gurman-apple-monitor-smart-home-display/">launch in 2024 at the earliest</a>, but there are only a few months left in the year and there have been no recent rumors.<br/>
<br/>
There have been <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/10/apple-27-inch-mini-led-display-cancelled/">on-again, off-again rumors</a> about Apple planning a new 27-inch external display with mini-LED backlighting, which would allow for increased brightness and higher contrast ratio. In April 2023, Apple supply chain analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said the display was <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/11/kuo-apple-27-inch-mini-led-display-still-planned/">slated for mass production in 2024 or early 2025</a>. It is unclear if this monitor would be the next Studio Display, or if it would have different branding.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Just over six months after <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman reported that <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/27/apple-cancels-electric-car-project/">Apple abandoned its plans to release an electric vehicle</a>, California's Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) canceled Apple's autonomous vehicle testing permit, according <a href="https://macreports.com/apple-officially-cancels-autonomous-vehicles-program-manufacturers-testing-permit/">to <em>macReports</em></a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2015/02/carplay-next-gen-hero.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-969129" /><br/>
The report states that the DMV received confirmation from Apple to cancel the permit on September 25, and the permit became canceled as of September 27. While this decision is not surprising given Gurman's reporting earlier this year, this is effectively the final nail in the coffin for Apple's decade-long electric vehicle project.<br/>
<br/>
The permit allowed Apple to test a self-driving vehicle with a safety driver on any public road within California. Apple received the permit in 2017, and <em>macReports</em> said that it would have been active until April 30, 2025 had it not been canceled.<br/>
<br/>
Apple was <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2017/04/27/apple-self-driving-lexus-suv-spotted/">using leased Lexus SUVs</a> equipped with an array of sensors and cameras to test various autonomous driving technologies on California streets.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[For this week's giveaway, we've <a href="https://southernstraps.com/">teamed up with Southern Straps</a> to give <em>MacRumors</em> readers a chance to win one of Apple's new Apple Watch Series 10 models and a Southern Straps band to go along with it. Southern Straps has been <a href="https://southernstraps.com/collections/nylon-bands-for-apple-watch">producing high-quality bands</a> for the Apple Watch for close to 10 years, and the company's selection of bands offer a great alternative to Apple's bands in unique styles that Apple does not offer.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-915893" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/southern-straps-nylon-band-3.jpg" alt="" width="3415" height="1921" /><br/>
Southern Straps has a range of nylon bands that pair a comfortable fit with a classic watch band design. After the Apple Watch came out in 2015, Southern Straps was the first company to make nylon Apple Watch bands, and with many years of experience, the company has had plenty of time to perfect the band's look and construction.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="https://southernstraps.com/collections/nylon-bands-for-apple-watch">Available for &#36;29</a>, each Southern Straps Apple Watch band is made from a single piece of nylon that is folded over, heat sealed, and stitched together for durability. The multi-step process makes sure that every band is going to hold up for multiple years of use, and there is a five-year warranty on the bands.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-915892" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/southern-straps-nylon-band-2.jpg" alt="" width="3381" height="1902" /><br/>
Southern Straps offers 11 color options, ranging from solid colors in green, black, and sand, to striped options in colorful combinations like blue and green, blue and orange, khaki and red, blue and white, black and gray, and the classic red, white, and blue.<br/>
<br/>
Bands can be ordered with hardware in black, silver, or gold to match the different Apple Watch models. There are two sizes: one that is compatible with 42mm to 49mm Apple Watch models, and one that is compatible with smaller 38mm to 41mm models. The bands work with every Apple Watch model from the original Apple Watch to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch-ultra/">Apple Watch Ultra 2</a> and the Series 10.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-915891" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/southern-straps-nylon-band-1.jpg" alt="" width="2823" height="1588" /><br/>
Pegged spring bars are included with each band so that you can change the hardware if you get an Apple Watch in a new size or a new color. Southern Straps bands are perfect for daily use for everything from work to working out.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6s4xoa8eDgI?si=XbX_Mx--Lq_uNrJk" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@themacrumorsshow?sub_confirmation=1">Subscribe to The MacRumors Show YouTube channel</a> for more videos</em></div><br/>
Multiple leaks surrounding Apple's unannounced 14-inch MacBook Pro with the M4 chip recently surfaced online. The leaks began with <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/06/alleged-m4-macbook-pro-unboxing-video/">unboxing videos</a> shared by several Russian YouTube channels, showcasing the new entry-level MacBook Pro ahead of its official announcement. These leaks were followed by a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/09/leaked-m4-macbook-pro-russian-classified-ad/">listing</a> on a Russian classifieds site, where multiple units were allegedly being sold after what appears to be theft from a warehouse. This marks <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/07/apple-potentially-facing-worst-leak-since-iphone-4/">one of Apple's most significant leaks</a> in recent memory, drawing comparisons to the 2010 <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> 4 prototype incident. <br/>
<br/>
The leaked MacBook Pro reveals several notable upgrades. The M4 chip with a 10-core CPU is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/07/m4-mac-chip-benchmarks/">25% faster</a> than the M3's 8-core CPU. <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/26/apple-new-macs-16gb-ram-standard/">As rumored</a>, it also comes with 16GB of RAM as the new base configuration, doubling the previous standard of 8GB, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/08/macbook-pro-m4-two-external-displays/">support for up to two external displays</a> with the lid open. Another key improvement is the addition of a third Thunderbolt port, bringing the entry-level model up to parity with the higher-end configurations. It also looks like the entry-level MacBook Pro will be available in the Space Black color option for the first time. Despite these upgrades, the display, general design, and other features remain unchanged from the current MacBook Pro. These revelations come just weeks before Apple is expected to officially unveil its first M4-powered Macs, with a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/06/apple-to-launch-new-m4-macs-nov-1/">rumored release date</a> of November 1.<br/>
<br/>
According to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/08/apple-release-schedule-changes/"><em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman</a>, Apple appears to be slowly moving away from its traditional annual release schedule for hardware and software, favoring a more staggered approach. This shift is evident with the introduction of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a>, where key features like Apple Intelligence are delayed and due to be rolled out in subsequent updates throughout 2025. As Apple's product lineup grows more complex, this strategy would allow for better quality control and innovation by releasing products and features when they are fully developed, rather than adhering to fixed timelines.<br/>
<br/>
While iPhones are expected to maintain their yearly updates, other products like the Apple Watch and Mac lineup may follow a multi-year or staggered release schedule to make the company's launches less predictable and more flexible. We discuss whether this is a good move for Apple and take stock of its product strategy as a whole in light of recent releases. <br/>

		<description><![CDATA[This week was Amazon's second Prime Day of 2024, and even though it's technically come to a close, there are still plenty of Apple discounts that remain live. This includes record low prices on the AirPods Max, Apple Watch SE, Apple Watch Ultra 2, iPad, and more.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>AirPods</h2><br/>

		<description><![CDATA[A few months ago, the SuperDrive <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/06/apple-superdrive-could-be-discontinued/">went out of stock on Apple's online store</a> in the U.S., and it is now listed as sold out or unavailable in all countries. Given it has yet to return, it seems likely that Apple has discontinued the 16-year-old accessory.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/8-Old-SuperDrives.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-928630" /><br/>
Introduced in 2008, the SuperDrive is an external CD/DVD drive that was released alongside the original MacBook Air, which lacked a built-in CD/DVD drive. Despite having an outdated USB-A cable attached to it, the SuperDrive remained available on Apple's online store until just recently, becoming one of the company's longest-sold products.<br/>
<br/>
CD/DVD drives have become a niche market, so it's not surprising that Apple has finally stopped selling the SuperDrive. There are plenty of other CD/DVD drives for customers who really need one, and they don't require a USB-C adapter for use with modern Macs. Nevertheless, it's the end of an era for a legacy technology at Apple.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/11/apple-quietly-discontinues-16-year-old-accessory/">Apple&#039;s 16-Year-Old SuperDrive Now Out of Stock Worldwide, Likely Discontinued</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apples-16-year-old-superdrive-now-out-of-stock-worldwide-likely-discontinued.2439817/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I recently had the opportunity to test out the latest <a href="https://www.zugucase.com">Zugu</a> case for the 13-inch M4 <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a>, and I came away impressed with its blend of style and functionality. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/10/zugu-ipad-pro-m4-case-0.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-970537" /><br/>
While designed for the newest &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; model, this case retains the key features that have made Zugu a popular choice among <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> users over the 14 years that the company has been operating.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Design and Protection</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/10/zugu-ipad-case-1.jpeg" alt="" width="5712" height="4284" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-970517" /><br/>
When I took the Zugu case out of the box, its minimalist appearance immediately caught my eye. I opted for the black color, which has an understated, professional look. The case is also available in slate (a subtle blue), berry (a rich red), and pine (a deep green). The soft pleather exterior feels good in the hand and provides a secure grip, unlike some slippery plastic alternatives.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/10/zugu-case-open.jpeg" alt="" width="5712" height="4284" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-970555" /><br/>
Underneath the exterior is a robust combination of TPU and polycarbonate, offering what feels like very decent drop protection. (I haven't had a mishap yet, but it certainly instills confidence.) Thick bumpers along the edges provide an extra layer of defense, particularly for the screen corners, which is something I always look for in a case. The volume and power button covers are also nicely tactile and rubbery.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/10/5zugu-ipad-pro-m4-case-e1728657056381.jpg" alt="" width="5430" height="3780" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-970541" /><br/>
I was pleased to discover it has a soft microfiber interior to help prevent scratches on the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; itself. Despite these protective features, the case on its own weighs a relatively light 515 grams, and it's only around half an inch thick with the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; inside and the lid closed. All of the speaker and port holes are well-aligned, while the top cover is a particularly notable protective feature, and completely covers the screen when closed. It also plays nice with the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj;'s sleep/wake feature. It's a welcome additional layer of protection against scratches and minor impacts when stowed in a bag on your commute.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Versatility and Convenience</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/10/1zugu-case-tilt.jpg" alt="" width="5712" height="4284" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-970581" /><br/>
The Zugu case's adaptability is definitely its standout feature. Its adjustable magnetic stand offers 10 different angles, which makes it suitable for various activities, whether you're browsing, typing, drawing with <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-pencil/">Apple Pencil</a>, or watching media. An extra thoughtful detail is the presence of air flow vents to prevent overheating during extended use or intensive bouts of gaming.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/10/11zugu-ipad-pro-m4-case.jpg" alt="" width="5712" height="4284" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-970545" /><br/>
During testing, I found the magnetic functionality particularly clever. By flipping up and exposing the magnetic feet in the kickstand, I could easily attach my &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; to metal surfaces like a refrigerator door. If you follow recipe instructions in the kitchen, this frees up valuable counter space. Just be mindful not to slam the fridge door while the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; is attached.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/10/10zugu-ipad-pro-m4-case.jpg" alt="" width="5712" height="4284" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-970544" /><br/>
Zugu also includes a couple of neat storage options for the &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj;. A recess along the side allows for easy snap-on wireless charging, while an elastic pocket on the back provides added security during transport.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/10/3zugu-ipad-pro-m4-case.jpg" alt="" width="5712" height="4284" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-970542" /><br/>
<h2>Summing Up</h2><br/>
Given that the 13-inch &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; starts at &#36;1299, there's really no point cutting corners when it comes to ensuring it's protected at all times. I wouldn't skimp when choosing a laptop case, and the same applies here. For me, the Zugu case for M4 &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; offers a compelling balance of protection, functionality, and style, at a competitive &#36;79.99 starting price. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/10/zugu-case-port-holes.jpg" alt="" width="5712" height="4284" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-970565" /><br/>
Its versatile stand options, secure magnetic mounting, and thoughtful design features like air vents and &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; integration set it apart from many competitors. While the magnets are generally strong, I'd still advise exercising caution when mounting the case on a vertical surface. Overall though, it's a solid choice for those seeking a premium, feature-rich case for their &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Where to Buy</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/10/zugu-ipad-pro-case.jpg" alt="" width="1080" height="688" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-970511" /><br/>
The Zugu case for &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; is available directly from Zugu's website, starting at &#36;79.99. Zugu also offers variants for other &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; models, including the 11-inch &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj;, the standard &zwnj;iPad&zwnj;, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/">iPad Air</a>, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-mini/">iPad mini</a>. Each Zugu case purchase also contributes funds to Children International, a humanitarian organization focused on helping kids around the world learn the skills needed to break free from poverty. Zugu has so far donated over &#36;1 million to the cause, according to its website.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Following the release of iOS 18 last month, some BMW owners have experienced issues with shared car keys in the Apple Wallet app, according to messages on the <a href="https://discussions.apple.com/thread/255773068">Apple Support Community</a> and the <a href="https://bmwi.bimmerpost.com/forums/showthread.php?t=2137262">largest BMW discussion forum</a>.<br/>

Affected users said that the "passive entry" feature that allows you to lock, unlock, and start compatible BMW vehicle models by simply having your iPhone on you no longer works for secondary Wallet keys shared with others, such as a spouse or other family member. The primary key still works for passive entry, the people said.<br/>
<br/>
The issue does not appear to be fixed in the iOS 18.0.1 update released last week, or in the latest iOS 18.1 beta. The underlying cause is unclear.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sph-M-6jNMo">shared a new ad</a> that highlights how artists used the iPad Pro and Apple Pencil Pro to design personalized artwork for seven NHL goalie masks being worn during the 2024-25 season. The artwork was then hand painted onto the masks.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Sph-M-6jNMo?si=gVmJUQRfRVZRPBcI" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><br/>
The goalie masks were created for Jeremy Swayman of the Boston Bruins, Jacob Markström of the New Jersey Devils, Stuart Skinner of the Edmonton Oilers, Sam Montembeault of the Montréal Canadiens, Linus Ullmark of the Ottawa Senators, Joseph Woll of the Toronto Maple Leafs, and Thatcher Demko of the Vancouver Canucks.<br/>
<br/>
NHL goalies have worn personalized masks for decades, but this is the first time that Apple has advertised becoming involved with the creative process.<br/>
<br/>
At least some of the masks were designed in Adobe Photoshop, based on the images below.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/10/iPad-NHL-Goalie-Mask.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-970566" /><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/10/iPad-NHL-Goalie-Mask-2-0.jpg" alt="" width="1610" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-970574" /><br/>

		<description><![CDATA[A key indicator of your MacBook's battery health is its cycle count. Keep reading to learn what it means and how you can check it for yourself.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/macbook-air-spacegray-purple-battery.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-913843" /><br/>
Modern MacBooks can last 18 hours or more on a single battery charge, but like all rechargeable batteries, the one in your Mac has a finite lifespan. Over time, its capacity to hold a charge gradually diminishes, potentially leaving you tethered to a power outlet more often than you'd like. This is where understanding your Mac's battery cycle count can be important.<br/>
<br/>
Checking your Mac's battery cycle count provides valuable insight into its overall health and remaining lifespan. A cycle count represents the number of times your battery has gone through a full charge cycle, which occurs when you use 100% of its capacity – whether in one sitting or spread across multiple partial charges. By monitoring this number, you can gauge how much life your battery has left and plan accordingly, whether that means adjusting your usage habits or preparing for a potential battery replacement down the line.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Checking Mac Battery Cycle Count</h2><br/>
Here's how to check it your Mac's battery cycle count:<br/>
<ol><br/>
  <li>Click the Apple symbol () in the menu bar while holding the <strong>Option</strong> key.</li><br/>
  <li>Select <strong>System Information</strong> from the dropdown menu.<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/10/system-information.jpg" alt="system info" width="1143" height="676" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-970485" /><br/>
  <li>In the new window, click the <strong>Hardware</strong> list in the left sidebar if its contents aren't showing.</li><br/>
  <li>Click <strong>Power</strong> in the expanded Hardware list.</li><br/>
  <li>Look for <strong>Cycle Count</strong> under "Health Information" in the Battery Information section of the main window.<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/10/cycle-count-mac.jpg" alt="sys info" width="1640" height="878" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-970486" /><br/>
</ol>This number represents how many times your battery has been fully discharged and recharged. <br/>
<br/>
Apple designs MacBook batteries to maintain up to 80% of their original capacity at their maximum cycle count, which varies by model. Recent MacBooks typically have a maximum cycle count of 1,000, while older models range from 300 to 500. You can find your specific model's maximum on <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-gb/102888">Apple's support website</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Remember, reaching the maximum cycle count doesn't mean your battery stops working. It simply indicates when you might notice a decrease in battery life. In macOS Catalina 10.15.5 and later, Apple includes an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/turn-off-optimized-battery-charging-mac/">Optimized Battery Charging feature</a>, which can help extend your battery's lifespan. <br/>
<br/>
Every new Mac bought from Apple comes with a one-year warranty that includes service coverage for a defective battery. If your Mac is out of warranty and the battery hasn't aged well, Apple offers <a href="https://support.apple.com/mac/repair/service#battery">battery service for a charge</a>.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/check-your-macs-battery-cycle-count/">Check Your Mac&#039;s Battery Cycle Count</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/check-your-macs-battery-cycle-count.2439810/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple has opened a new applied research laboratory in Shenzhen, China, marking a significant expansion of its research and development capabilities in the world's largest smartphone market. The facility, which began operations on Thursday, is located in the Hetao Shenzhen-Hong Kong tech cooperation zone.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/10/hetao-shenzen-hong-kong-tech-hub-xinhua.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-970464" /><div class="center-wrap"><em>Hetao Shenzhen-Hong Kong Science and Tech Cooperation Zone, China (Photo: Xinhua)</em></div><br/>
Apple announced plans for the Shenzhen lab in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/12/apple-to-expand-research-facilities-in-china/">March</a>, stating it would enhance testing and research for major products including the iPhone, iPad, and Vision Pro spatial computing headset. The lab is also intended to strengthen Apple's collaboration with local suppliers.<br/>
<br/>
Spanning 20,000 square meters (215,000 square feet) in its initial phase, the facility is set to become Apple's research and development hub in the Greater Bay Area. This economic region encompasses Hong Kong, Macau, and nine cities in Guangdong province.<br/>
<br/>
According to state media reports, the lab will eventually employ over 1,000 domestic and international talents. Apple has described it as its "most extensive" lab outside the United States, underscoring the company's commitment to the Chinese market.<br/>
<br/>
The move comes as Apple faces increasing competition in China, particularly from Shenzhen-based Huawei. Recent data from research firm CINNO showed that in August, Huawei outsold Apple in mainland China for the first time in nearly four years.<br/>
<br/>
Despite efforts to diversify its manufacturing supply chain outside China, Apple continues to invest in research within the country. The company has previously established research centers in Beijing, Shanghai, Suzhou, and Shenzhen, with its research and development team in China reportedly doubling in size over the past five years.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple is once again planning to cut the interest rate of its <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-card/">Apple Card</a> high-yield savings account, with the new rate set to go live on Friday, October 11.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/04/apple-card-savings-account-16x9.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-892213" /><br/>
The &zwnj;Apple Card&zwnj; savings account's annual percentage yield (APR) will drop to 4.10 percent, down from 4.25 percent. This is the third cut that Apple has made this year, and the second in the last few weeks.<br/>
<br/>
Back in late September, Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/25/apple-card-savings-account-interest-rate-cut/">lowered the APY</a> from 4.4 percent to 4.25 percent, and rates dropped from 4.5 percent to 4.4 percent in April.<br/>
<br/>
At 4.10 percent, the Apple savings account APY will be below 4.15 APY that it launched with back in April 2023. Savings account interest rates fluctuate with changes made by the Federal Reserve, and when rates are lowered, banks cut their APYs. There was a notable rate cut of 50 basis points in September, and today, Federal Reserve policymakers suggested that more cuts <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/rates-bonds/fed-seen-delivering-25-bps-cut-next-month-after-inflation-data-2024-10-10/">are on the horizon</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Several other high-yield savings accounts from companies like Discover, American Express, and Capital One also now have a 4.10 APY.<br/>
<br/>
Apple partners with Goldman Sachs for the Apple savings account. It is available for &zwnj;Apple Card&zwnj; holders, and can be managed through the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> Wallet app much like the &zwnj;Apple Card&zwnj;. The Apple savings account is designed to allow &zwnj;Apple Card&zwnj; users to earn interest on their Daily Cash balance, and on funds transferred from bank accounts or Apple Cash balances.<br/>
<br/>
Earlier this month, Apple decreased the &zwnj;Apple Card&zwnj; APR range, and it is now at 18.74 percent to 28.99 percent, down from 19.24 percent to 29.49 percent.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-card/">Apple Card</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/10/apple-card-savings-account-rate-cut/">Apple Card High-Yield Savings Account Getting Yet Another Interest Rate Cut</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-card-high-yield-savings-account-getting-yet-another-interest-rate-cut.2439770/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Though smart rings with health capabilities have been growing in popularity, Apple has no plans to join the smart ring market, according to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-10-06/when-will-apple-intelligence-be-released-when-is-apple-releasing-m4-macs-ipad-m1xksx7q"><em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman</a>. While Apple explored the idea, there is no active development of a ring going on at this time, and Apple has no plans to launch a ring.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/samsung-ring.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="800" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-941127" /><em>Samsung's Galaxy Ring</em></div><br/>
Smart rings on the market from <a href="https://ouraring.com/">companies like Oura</a> measure heart rate, track body temperature, and have sleep tracking capabilities, all of which are functions of the Apple Watch. If Apple released a smart ring, it would have the same feature set of the Apple Watch, and it would likely cannibalize Apple Watch sales.<br/>
<br/>
Back in February, Gurman said that Apple's industrial team had suggested that Apple work on a smart ring, with the device possibly serving as a lower-cost alternative to the Apple Watch. Apple executives apparently weren't interested, and active development didn't happen.<br/>
<br/>
Gurman's report <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/20/apple-ring-allegedly-in-development/">followed a February rumor</a> from Korean site <em>Electronic Times</em>, which said that Apple was "speeding up development" of a smart ring that could be used for health tracking. The site claimed that Apple was weighing the idea of a smart ring as an expansion of its wearables lineup, but those rumors may have been spurred by Samsung's Galaxy Ring.<br/>
<br/>
Samsung <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/10/samsung-galaxy-z-fold6-flip6/">introduced the Galaxy Ring</a> in July alongside new foldable smart phones. Designed to work only with Galaxy devices, the Galaxy Ring tracks movement, sleep, heart rate, and respiratory rate, providing users with a daily sleep score and an energy score.<br/>
<br/>
New devices from Samsung can spur rumors about Apple products because the two companies typically compete in the same markets, but there are some instances where Apple has not followed in Samsung's footsteps. Samsung has had foldable smartphones for years now, and Apple still seems to have no concrete plans for a foldable <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>.<br/>
<br/>
There have been Apple patents for ring-like devices, and those patents have also led to "iRing" rumors, but Apple patents all kinds of strange things that never make it to launch.<br/>
<br/>
Gurman is a reliable source for information on Apple's future plans, but there are some who still seem to think an Apple ring is coming. CCS Insight told <em>CNBC</em> <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/10/08/apple-could-launch-a-ring-to-rival-samsung-in-2026-ccs-insight.html">just this week</a> that Apple might launch a "connected ring" to rival Samsung by 2026.<br/>
<br/>
Rather than launching a ring, Apple may instead lower the price of the Apple Watch. The next-generation <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch-se/">Apple Watch SE</a> that's slated for 2025 is expected to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/05/apple-watch-se-plastic/">include a plastic casing</a> that could bring lower costs and more appeal to customers looking for something cheap and durable, either for themselves or for their children.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/10/apple-smart-ring-no-plans/">Apple Has No Plans For a Smart Ring</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-has-no-plans-for-a-smart-ring.2439768/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Starting with iOS 18, Apple said event tickets in the Wallet app on the iPhone are able to offer an all-new design that displays key information, and Ticketmaster today <a href="https://business.ticketmaster.com/press-release/apple-wallet-experience/">announced</a> that it will be the first ticketing company to roll out this enhanced experience.<br/>
<br/>

The redesigned tickets will include more relevant information about an event, such as a map of the venue, parking details, recommended Apple Music playlists, local forecasts from the Weather app, and quick access to location sharing. In addition, venues and sports teams can add links to their app or website to the ticket.<br/>
<br/>
Ticketmaster said the first event that will offer its redesigned tickets in the Wallet app will be Los Angeles FC's upcoming match against the San Jose Earthquakes at BMO Stadium on Saturday, October 19. iPhone users who have updated their device to iOS 18 or later can add their tickets to the Wallet app through the Ticketmaster or LAFC apps.<br/>
<br/>
Ticketmaster said the Miami Heat will be the next team to debut the new ticket experience, but it did not say when, and the new tickets will roll out more widely in 2025.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-18/">iPadOS 18</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-wallet/">Apple Wallet</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-18.244">iOS 18</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-18.245">iPadOS 18</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/10/ticketmaster-ios-18-event-tickets/">Ticketmaster to Start Rolling Out New-and-Improved Tickets in Apple Wallet App on iOS 18</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ticketmaster-to-start-rolling-out-new-and-improved-tickets-in-apple-wallet-app-on-ios-18.2439762/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[In a <a href="https://x.com/tim_cook/status/1844469125529337930">social media post</a> today, Apple CEO Tim Cook said that Apple will be making a donation of an undisclosed amount to Hurricane Milton relief efforts.<br/>
<br/>

"Our hearts go out to all of those impacted by the devastation of Hurricane Milton," said Cook. "To everyone still in harm's way, please stay safe. Apple will be making a donation to help with relief efforts on the ground."<br/>
<br/>
Hurricane Milton made landfall near Siesta Key, Florida late Wednesday. The storm, and many tornadoes that resulted from it, caused catastrophic damage, flooding, and loss of life across many areas of Florida. <br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today stopped signing iOS 18.0, preventing <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> users who have upgraded to iOS 18.0.1 from downgrading to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a>. Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/03/apple-releases-ios-18-0-1/">released iOS 18.0.1</a> a week ago on October 3.<br/>
<br/>

It is not unusual for Apple to stop signing older versions of iOS within a week or two after a new version of iOS is released. When Apple stops signing an update, it can no longer be installed on an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; due to a server-side software verification check that happens before new software is installed, so those who have upgraded to the latest version of &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj; cannot downgrade to iOS 18.0.<br/>
<br/>
Apple prevents downgrading to older versions of iOS to encourage &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; users to keep their operating systems up to date with the latest security fixes. <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a> users who have upgraded to iOS 18.0.1 can no longer install any older software, but <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a> and earlier users have the option of downgrading to iOS 17.7, which is also still signed.<br/>
