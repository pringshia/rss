		<description><![CDATA[Apple today shared a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ra9I0HScTDw">heartwarming ad</a> for its new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/06/05/ios-17-personal-voice/">Personal Voice accessibility feature</a>, available on the iPhone, iPad, and Mac.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/05/Personal-Voice-iPhone-Feature.jpeg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-896144" /><br/>
Introduced with iOS 17, iPadOS 17, and macOS Sonoma, Personal Voice allows those at risk of losing their ability to speak to create a synthesized voice that sounds similar to their actual voice, so they can continue to communicate with others.<br/>
<br/>
Personal Voice integrates with another accessibility feature called Live Speech, which lets users type what they want to say to have it be spoken aloud during in-person conversations, phone calls, and FaceTime video calls.<br/>
<br/>
In the two-minute video, called "The Lost Voice," a father uses Personal Voice and Live Speech to read aloud a bedtime story with his daughter.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ra9I0HScTDw?si=9iP1J0kg2nYprZjw" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><br/>
To create a Personal Voice, users read aloud a randomized set of text prompts until 15 minutes of audio has been recorded. The feature can be found in the Settings app under Accessibility → Personal Voice, and it is currently available for English only. Apple says the feature uses on-device machine learning for privacy and security.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-ads/">Apple Ads</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/30/apple-ad-for-personal-voice-feature/">Apple Highlights iPhone Feature That Lets You Preserve Your Own Voice</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-highlights-iphone-feature-that-lets-you-preserve-your-own-voice.2412472/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[As part of its efforts to expand its U.S. manufacturing, Apple today <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2023/11/apple-announces-expanded-partnership-with-amkor-for-silicon-packaging/">announced</a> that Amkor will package some Apple silicon chips at its new facility being built in Peoria, Arizona. The chips will be produced at a nearby TSMC factory, and then Amkor will handle packaging, a final step that protects the chip from physical damage.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/apple-silicon-1-feature.jpg" alt="" width="1422" height="800" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-924673" /><br/>
Amkor will invest approximately &#36;2 billion in the facility, which will employ more than 2,000 people once it is completed, according to the announcement.<br/>
<br/>
"Apple is deeply committed to the future of American manufacturing, and we'll continue to expand our investment here in the United States," said Apple's operating chief Jeff Williams, in a press release today. "Apple silicon has unlocked new levels of performance for our users, enabling them to do things they could never do before, and we are thrilled that Apple silicon will soon be produced and packaged in Arizona."<br/>
<br/>
In its own press release today, Amkor <a href="https://ir.amkor.com/news-releases/news-release-details/amkor-announces-us-advanced-packaging-and-test-facility">announced</a> that it plans to begin limited production at the facility within the next two to three years. The company said it applied for <a href="https://www.nist.gov/chips">CHIPS funding</a> from the U.S. federal government to help fund the project. <br/>
<br/>
Apple says Amkor has packaged chips used in all of its products for more than a decade. Apple silicon chips are found in iPhones, iPads, Macs, and other devices, but it's unclear exactly which chips will be packaged  at the new facility in Arizona.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-silicon/">Apple Silicon</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/30/apple-amkor-chip-packaging-new-arizona-facility/">Some Apple Silicon Chips Will Soon Be Produced and Packaged in U.S.</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/some-apple-silicon-chips-will-soon-be-produced-and-packaged-in-u-s.2412465/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

We last saw this deal during Black Friday and Cyber Monday deals, and Amazon has been one of the only retailers to offer the sale.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/11/airpods-pro-2-holiday-snowflakes.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-872479" /><em><small>Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with Amazon. When you click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment, which helps us keep the site running.</small></em><br/>
<br/>
Apple launched these earbuds in September and their headlining new feature is the addition of a USB-C port on the MagSafe Charging Case, replacing the Lightning port. There are a few minor changes to the AirPods Pro 2 besides the addition of USB-C, including additional dust resistance and support for lossless audio with the Vision Pro headset.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0CHWRXH8B%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"target="_blank"><div class="fancybutton"><div class="fancybadge">&#36;59 OFF</div>AirPods Pro 2 with USB-C for &#36;189.99</div></a></div><br/>
<br/>
Apple doesn't sell the USB-C/MagSafe Charging Case separately, so if you want USB-C support you'll have to purchase a full new set of earbuds.

		<description><![CDATA[Google has issued a critical security update for Chrome on macOS, Windows, and Linux that fixes a zero-day vulnerability in the browser. On Tuesday, Google in a Chrome <a href="https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/2023/11/stable-channel-update-for-desktop_28.html">stable channel update</a> said it "is aware that an exploit for <a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-6345">CVE-2023-6345</a> exists in the wild."<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/06/Chrome-Feature-22.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-851161" /><br/>
Google has not provided further details about the CVE-2023-6345 exploit, which was discovered last week by security researchers in Google's Threat Analysis Group (TAG). However, it is believed to be related to Skia, the open-source 2D graphics library in the Chrome graphics engine. <br/>
<br/>
According to the notes for the macOS update 119.0.6045.199, the exploit allowed at least one attacker to "potentially perform a sandbox escape via a malicious file," which could theoretically result in arbitrary code execution and data theft.<br/>
<br/>
Users who have Chrome browser set up to automatically update should not need to do anything. Anyone else is advised to manually update immediately (version 119.0.6045.199 on macOS) to avoid the risk posed by the zero-day exploit. In Chrome settings, click the About Chrome tab, and click Update Google Chrome. If there is no option to update, you are already on the latest version. <br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Meta intends to launch Threads in the European Union next month, according to a report by <em><a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/meta-threads-europe-launch-98448df5">The Wall Street Journal</a></em>. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/07/instagram-threads-app.jpg" alt="" width="1079" height="607" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-902359" /><br/>
The social media network debuted in most markets in July, but did not launch in the EU because Meta was unsure whether it would be able to adhere to the bloc's stringent regulations for online services. Threads can import data from Instagram, including behavioral and advertising information.<br/>
<br/>
According to sources who spoke to <em>WSJ</em>, Meta will comply with the regulations by giving EU users a choice of using Threads purely for consumption, without a profile that allows them to make their own posts.<br/>
<br/>
The change coincides with recent comments by Adam Mosseri, head of Instagram, who said the platform was rolling out a way to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/14/delete-threads-profile-keep-instagram-account/">delete or deactivate a Threads profile separately</a> while leaving the associated Instagram account intact.<br/>
<br/>
The large market expansion should see Threads' user numbers take a jump. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said on a company earnings call last month that Threads now has "just under" 100 million monthly users. Since its launch earlier this year it has gained a web app, an ability to search for posts, and a post editing feature.   <br/>
<br/>
The expansion comes after several major advertisers, including Apple and Disney, suspended ad spending on Threads rival X (formerly Twitter) after Elon Musk posted controversial comments from his account. Musk on Wednesday said the post in question was a "mistake," and anyone trying to "blackmail" him over advertising money could "go f–yourself," while also admitting the loss of ad revenue could end the social media platform.<br/>

Many of the deals in this sale are the same exact prices we tracked during Samsung's Black Friday sale, making Samsung one of the few retailers to keep these best-ever prices around all week. <br/>

The Smart Monitor M8 is available for <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2FB0C3WMX69W%2Fref%3Dox_sc_act_title_1%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26smid%3DATVPDKIKX0DER%26th%3D1%26geniuslink%3Dtrue"><strong>&#36;399.99</strong></a> (&#36;300 off) and the ViewFinity S9 5K Display is available for <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2FB0CB71BY87%2Fref%3Dox_sc_act_title_1%3Fsmid%3DATVPDKIKX0DER%26th%3D1"><strong>&#36;1,201.82</strong></a> (&#36;398 off).

<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/02/arm-logo-blue-bg.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-783300" /><br/>
Apple licenses the underlying technology used in the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>, Mac, Apple Watch, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a>, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod/">HomePod</a> from Arm. Despite being one of its biggest and most important customers, Apple represents less than five percent of Arm's annual revenue, with the company paying the least of any of Arm's smartphone chip customers. Apple pays a flat fee of less than 30 cents in royalties for each chip used in its devices, regardless of how many cores it has.<br/>
<br/>
SoftBank is the owner of Arm, and in 2017, the company's CEO gathered Arm executives and explained that Apple pays more for the piece of plastic that used to be used to protect the screens of new iPhones than it does to license Arm's intellectual property. SoftBank's attempts to renegotiate Arm's deal with Apple to raise royalty rates were apparently unsuccessful. <br/>
<br/>
While Apple is unlikely to sever its ties with Arm, the company has apparently explored the long-term possibility of using a competing open-source technology for its chips called RISC-V. Apple's current licensing agreement with Arm was signed in September and it "extends beyond 2040," but the chip architect is said to have continually attempted to renegotiate its financial terms.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/theinformation-com/">The Information</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-silicon/">Apple Silicon</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/29/apple-pays-less-than-30-cents-per-chip/">Report: Apple Pays Less Than 30 Cents in Royalties to Arm Per Chip</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/report-apple-pays-less-than-30-cents-in-royalties-to-arm-per-chip.2412363/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

Apple says it donation through this initiative will be limited to a maximum of &#36;1 million.<br/>

The Global Fund aims to combat diseases such as HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria throughout the developing world. Apple says its donation to the organization will continue to "help fund critical health programs that save lives."<br/>
<br/>
Apple has supported The Global Fund for 17 years through its partnership with the (RED) brand, co-founded by U2 singer Bono in 2006. Apple offers several products in a <a href="https://www.apple.com/product-red/">(PRODUCT)RED</a> color, ranging from iPhones to Apple Watch bands, and a portion of the proceeds from every one of these products sold by Apple goes to The Global Fund.<br/>
<br/>

<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/05/Apple-5G-Modem-Feature-Triad.jpg" alt="" width="1810" height="1018" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-798434" /><br/>
According to the operator of news aggregator account <a href="https://m.blog.naver.com/PostView.naver?blogId=yeux1122&logNo=223278322589&navType=by">"yeux1122" on the Naver blog</a>, supply chain sources related to  Apple's 5G modem departments claim that the company's attempts to develop its own modem have failed so far, and that Apple is in the process of winding down its years-long investment in the project. Separately, the leaker known as <a href="https://x.com/Tech_Reve/status/1729824690951356893?s=20">@Tech_Reve</a> today said they had heard similar reports from a Japanese supply chain source.<br/>
<br/>
It's too early to say if the latest reports are accurate, but according to a September <em>Wall Street Journal</em> <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/21/apple-wsj-5gm-modem-project-challenges/">report</a>, Apple's attempts to develop its own modem chip have been hampered by major issues related to unrealistic goals, an inadequate understanding of the challenges involved, and unusable prototypes.<br/>
<br/>
Apple's plan to design its own in-house modem led to the hiring of thousands of engineers: Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2019/07/25/apple-intel-acquisition/">acquired</a> the majority of Intel's smartphone modem business in 2019, and as it filled the project's ranks with Intel engineers and others hired from Qualcomm, company executives set a goal to have the modem chip ready for fall 2023.<br/>
<br/>
Earlier this month, <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/16/apple-in-house-5g-modem-delays/">reported</a> that Apple was continuing to run into troubles in its attempt to develop a 5G modem to replace Qualcomm's 5G modems in the iPhone and other products. The modem chip launch was said to have been postponed until the end of 2025 or early 2026, but Apple was reportedly still planning to introduce the technology in a version of the low-cost iPhone SE.<br/>
<br/>
Development on a modem chip was said to be in the early stages, and it "may lag behind the competition by years." One version in development does not support faster mmWave technology, and Apple has also run into issues with the Intel code that it has been working with. Rewrites have been required, and adding new features has been causing existing features to break, plus Apple has to be careful not to infringe on Qualcomm patents while developing the chip.<br/>
<br/>
Despite delays, the company was thought to be continuing development because it is eager to end its expensive deal with Qualcomm. In 2017, Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2017/01/20/apple-qualcomm-1-billion-lawsuit/">sued Qualcomm</a> over alleged anticompetitive practices and &#36;1 billion in unpaid royalty rebates. The two companies <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2019/04/16/apple-qualcomm-settlement/">settled the lawsuit in 2019</a>. <br/>
<br/>
Apple's first modem chip was expected to be a standalone chip, but the company hoped to eventually develop a system-on-a-chip that would also cut out suppliers like Broadcom and give it more control over component development.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-5g-modem/">Apple 5G Modem</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/29/apple-5g-modem-discontinued-reports/">Apple to Discontinue Custom 5G Modem Development, Claim Reports</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-to-discontinue-custom-5g-modem-development-claim-reports.2412350/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Google Drive for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> has been <a href="https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2023/11/updates-to-google-drive-scanner-on-android-and-ios.html">updated</a> to finally include the document scanning feature that has featured in the Android version of the app for almost a decade.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/05/Google-Drive.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="840" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-847028" /><br/>
Rolling out over the next three days, the scanning feature can be accessed via the app's camera icon. The scanner detects the edges of a document in the viewfinder, aligns things properly, and removes all glare and tilt to achieve a clean scan ready for uploading. <br/>
<br/>
Multiple pages can be scanned in a session, users can crop scans if needed, and users residing in the U.S. can receive relevant title suggestions based on machine learning, according to Google. Apple has included a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/ios-11-document-scanner-notes/">similar scanning feature in its stock Notes app</a> since 2017.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple is ending its credit card partnership with Goldman Sachs, according to <em><a href="https://www.wsj.com/finance/banking/apple-pulls-plug-on-goldman-credit-card-partnership-ca1dfb45">The Wall Street Journal</a></em>. Apple plans to stop working with Goldman Sachs in the next 12 to 15 months, and it is not yet clear if Apple has established a new partnership for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-card/">Apple Card</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-785924" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/02/apple-card-1.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" /><br/>
Apple and Goldman Sachs will dissolve their entire consumer partnership, including the &zwnj;Apple Card&zwnj; and the Apple Savings account. Apple in a statement that was provided to <em><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/11/28/apple-is-trying-to-unwind-its-goldman-sachs-credit-card-partnership.html">CNBC</a></em> said that it will continue to provide "the best tools and services" for &zwnj;Apple Card&zwnj; customers.<blockquote>"Apple and Goldman Sachs are focused on providing an incredible experience for our customers to help them lead healthier financial lives. The award-winning Apple Card has seen a great reception from consumers, and we will continue to innovate and deliver the best tools and services for them."</blockquote>Rumors earlier this year suggested that Goldman Sachs wanted to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/06/30/goldman-sachs-apple-partnership-amex/">get out of its relationship</a> with Apple as part of a plan to cut back on its consumer business. Goldman Sachs at the time was said to be speaking with American Express about a possible takeover, but the &zwnj;Apple Card&zwnj; needs to run on the Mastercard network until 2026 due to a deal established between Apple and Goldman Sachs. Amex also had concerns about aspects of the program such as loan loss rates due to Apple's push to have customers approved, so the status of the talks is not known.<br/>
<br/>
Synchrony Financial, known as the largest issuer of store credit cards, has considered taking over the &zwnj;Apple Card&zwnj;, according to <em>The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/wsj-com/">Wall Street Journal</a></em>. <br/>
<br/>
Goldman Sachs and Apple have worked together on the &zwnj;Apple Card&zwnj; since it launched in 2019, and have also teamed up for the high-yield Apple Savings account and the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-pay/">Apple Pay</a> Later feature. The partnership <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/07/25/apple-goldman-sachs-apple-card-issues/">has not gone smoothly</a>, with Goldman Sachs running into <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/07/25/apple-goldman-sachs-apple-card-issues/">customer service issues</a> due to long wait times for disputed &zwnj;Apple Card&zwnj; transactions and issues with the Apple Savings account.<br/>
<br/>
The U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/us-fed-probes-goldman-sachs-consumer-business-wsj-2023-01-20/">launched an investigation</a> into Goldman Sachs due to the customer complaints, leading to tension with Apple. Apple is unhappy with the customer service reputation of its &zwnj;Apple Card&zwnj; and Apple Savings products, while some Goldman Sachs executives blame Apple for the regulatory scrutiny. <br/>
<br/>
Goldman Sachs was new to consumer banking when the &zwnj;Apple Card&zwnj; launched, and to establish a deal with Apple, it is not collecting fees that many credit card issuers receive. The bank does not get a cut of the fee that merchants pay to Apple to accept the &zwnj;Apple Card&zwnj;, nor is it able to collect annual fees, late fees, or foreign transaction fees. Goldman Sachs does earn money from loans issued to cardholders who split Apple purchases into installments, but it is not known if Apple will be able to establish a similar deal with another issuer because of the limited revenue the &zwnj;Apple Card&zwnj; provides. <br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/28/apple-goldman-sachs-partnership-ending/">Apple Ending Apple Card Partnership With Goldman Sachs</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-ending-apple-card-partnership-with-goldman-sachs.2412297/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple is wrapping up development on iOS 17.2, with the update expected to come out in December. While we're getting to the end of the beta testing period, Apple is still tweaking features and adding new functionality.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/iOS-17.2-Feature-Warm.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-918854" /><br/>
We've rounded up everything new in the fourth beta of iOS 17.2.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Default Notification Sound</h2><br/>
Under Sounds & Haptics, there's a new "Default Alerts" section that allows you to choose the sound used for all incoming notifications aside from texts, mail alerts, and calendar alerts, which already had customization options.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/ios-17-default-alert.jpg" alt="" width="5526" height="3108" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-924433" /><br/>
All of the text tones can be used for the default notification sound, plus there is an option to also change the haptic vibration of default notifications.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Collaborative Apple Music Playlists</h2><br/>
While collaborative <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/">Apple Music</a> playlists were introduced in an earlier version of iOS 17.2, Apple has removed the option in the fourth beta, which suggests this is not an option that will be coming in iOS 17.2 after all.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/apple-music-collaborative-playlists.jpg" alt="" width="5484" height="3085" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-918890" /><br/>
<h2>AppleCare Settings</h2><br/>
The "Coverage" section under Settings > General has been renamed to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/applecare/">AppleCare</a> & Warranty. It still includes &zwnj;AppleCare&zwnj; info for your <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> and connected devices such as the Apple Watch and AirPods.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/applecare-warranty-ios-17-2.jpg" alt="" width="2452" height="1379" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-924448" /><br/>
Under General > About there's a new Warranty section that provides coverage information for the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Recording to an External Device</h2><br/>
With the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a> models, ProRes video can be recorded directly to an external device. iOS 17.2 appears to include a new pop up message that lets users know that external recording is not working because of a USB-C cable that is too slow.<br/>
<br/>
There was previously a warning about an external storage device not having a fast enough write speed to support external recording, but now there is an added message about the write speed of the USB-C cable.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>iTunes</h2><br/>
Code in iOS 17.2 confirms that Apple is planning to eliminate the option to purchase TV shows and movies in the iTunes app. TV and movie content will need to be purchased in the TV app in the future, but for now, the change has not actually been implemented.<br/>
<br/>
"You can buy or rent TV shows and find your purchases in the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a> app," reads the code.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/28/apple-releases-ios-17-2-beta-4/">fourth beta of iOS 17.2</a> that Apple released today adds a much-desired feature, the option to change the default notification alert.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/ios-17-default-alert.jpg" alt="" width="5526" height="3108" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-924433" /><br/>
Under Sounds & Haptics, there's a new "Default Alerts" section that allows you to choose the sound used for all incoming notifications aside from texts, mail alerts, and calendar alerts, which already had customization options. <br/>
<br/>
Apple has not previously offered an interface for tweaking the default notification sound, so this is a notable update for those who have always wanted to select a sound. All of the text tones can be used for the default notification sound.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">iOS 17.2 beta 4 allows you to change the default notification sound and haptic <a href="https://t.co/f7Vxny3Jcc">pic.twitter.com/f7Vxny3Jcc</a></p>&mdash; iSoftware Updates (@iSWUpdates) <a href="https://twitter.com/iSWUpdates/status/1729568826751152479?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 28, 2023</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div><br/>
There's also an option to change the default haptic feedback. Apple in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a> changed the haptic alert, and now it can be changed back or customized for those who were not happy with the update. <div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-17/">iPadOS 17</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-17.241">iOS 17</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-17.242">iPadOS 17</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/28/ios-17-2-change-default-notification/">iOS 17.2 Beta Adds Option to Change Default Notification Sound and Haptics</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-17-2-beta-adds-option-to-change-default-notification-sound-and-haptics.2412271/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today released the fourth betas of upcoming iOS 17.2 and iPadOS 17.2 updates to developers for testing purposes, with the software coming two weeks after Apple released the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/14/apple-seeds-ios-17-2-beta-3-to-developers/">the third betas of iOS 17.2 and iPadOS 17.2</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-918852" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/iOS-17.2-Feature-Cool.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" /><br/>
Registered developers are able to opt into the betas by opening up the Settings app, going to the Software Update section, tapping on the "Beta Updates" option, and toggling on the ‌<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a> or <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-17/">iPadOS 17</a>‌ Developer Beta. An <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-id/">Apple ID</a> associated with a developer account is required to download and install the beta.<br/>
<br/>
The biggest new feature in iOS 17.2 is the Journal app, which can be used to record daily activities and thoughts. You can write about your day to day life, but Apple also provides topic suggestions based on the music you listen to, the places you visit, and the people you see. Journal entries support pictures, voice recordings, and location information, with the app organized by entry date.<br/>
<br/>
In <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/">Apple Music</a>, there's a Favorites playlist that houses everything you've favorited, plus Apple added support for collaborative playlists. You can now share a playlist with multiple people, and each participant can add songs.<br/>
<br/>
Stickers can now be used to reply to iMessages when you long press on a chat bubble in the Messages app, and there's also now support for the extra-secure iMessage Contact Key Verification option. If you have an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a>, the Action Button supports Translate in iOS 17.2, and there are new Weather and Clock widgets.<br/>
