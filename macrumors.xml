		<description><![CDATA[In a social media post last week, <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman said iOS 18 will include <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/31/ios-18-control-center-updates-rumor/">"updates" to Control Center</a>, and he has now outlined a few specific changes.<br/>
<br/>

In the <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-06-02/apple-ipad-pro-m4-chip-review-company-inches-closer-to-laptops-with-new-tablets-lwxjbna0">latest edition of his <em>Power On</em> newsletter</a> on Sunday, Gurman said Control Center will feature an upgraded music widget and improved controls for HomeKit smart home accessories. However, he did not provide any further details about these changes, so all we know for now is these will apparently be two focus areas for Apple.<br/>
<br/>
Apple will unveil iOS 18 during its <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/28/wwdc-2024-full-schedule/">WWDC keynote on June 10</a>, and the first beta should be made available to members of the Apple Developer Program immediately following the presentation.

		<title>Apple Vision Pro Mindfulness App May Get &#039;Respiration Tracking&#039; Feature</title>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple is working on a new "respiration tracking" feature for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a> that is likely to be functional during mindfulness sessions, based on backend code discovered by <em>MacRumors</em>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/mindfulness-vision-pro.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-953177" /><br/>
Contributor Aaron Perris found references to the previously unheard-of feature in lines of code related to the headset's Mindfulness app, which offers users an immersive meditation experience using either guided meditations or self-guided sessions.<br/>
<br/>
Apple's Mindfulness app essentially encourages the user to cultivate awareness of their own breath to support mental wellbeing. Attention to breathing is generally considered to be a foundational component of mindfulness practice, and long-term mindfulness training is associated with reliable differences in resting respiration rate, according to empirical research. <br/>
<br/>
Apple Watch can already track respiration rate while wearers are sleeping. Apple Watch uses its built-in accelerometer, which measures vibration and movement, to determine how many times a person breathes each minute. While the Vision Pro also has an accelerometer, it's unclear whether this hardware or sensors that track changes in facial musculature would be involved when a mindfulness session is in progress. <br/>
<br/>
There's no information suggesting if or when the feature could make an appearance, but Apple is expected to announce <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/visionos/">visionOS</a> 2 at its annual developers conference, WWDC, which begins next week, June 10.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AppleVisionPro">Vision Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-vision-pro.209">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/03/apple-vision-pro-mindfulness-respiration/">Apple Vision Pro Mindfulness App May Get &#039;Respiration Tracking&#039; Feature</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-vision-pro-mindfulness-app-may-get-respiration-tracking-feature.2428034/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Amazon today has a <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FApple-Smartwatch-Aluminum-Fitness-Resistant%2Fdp%2FB0CSVB8BP1%3Fref_%3Dast_sto_dp%26th%3D1">large collection of Apple Watch Series 9 models</a> on sale at all-time low prices, including both GPS and cellular devices. It's been a few weeks since we last tracked any notable markdowns on the Series 9, so if you've been waiting for a deal now is definitely the time to buy the wearable.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/12/series-9-blue.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-926442" /><em><small>Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with Amazon. When you click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment, which helps us keep the site running.</small></em><br/>
<br/>
You can get up to &#36;100 off most Apple Watch Series 9 models right now on Amazon, starting at <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FApple-Smartwatch-Aluminum-Fitness-Resistant%2Fdp%2FB0CSVB8BP1%3Fref_%3Dast_sto_dp%26th%3D1"><strong>&#36;299.00</strong></a> for the 41mm GPS watches. We've rounded up all of the deals in lists below, focusing on the aluminum devices, but you can also find &#36;100 discounts on a few stainless steel models as well.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fstores%2Fpage%2F2053BA59-F374-47FC-9333-5BF1839E8DEB%3Fingress%3D2%26visitId%3D41892507-7fff-44b6-896a-be2f1740c26f%26ref_%3Dast_bln"target="_blank"><div class="fancybutton"><div class="fancybadge">&#36;100 OFF</div>Apple Watch Series 9 Discounts at Amazon</div></a></div><br/>
<br/>
All of the Apple Watch Series 9 devices in this sale lack the Blood Oxygen feature that were available on models prior to the sales ban that began in the United States back in January. The sales ban covers any Apple Watch model with blood oxygen sensing, and since it began most retailers continued to sell through their stock of devices that still supported the feature.<br/>
<br/>
Now that it's been a few months, retailers like Amazon are starting to see their stock dwindle on Apple Watch Series 9 and Ultra 2 models with blood oxygen support. Other than this, the Apple Watch Series 9 is the exact same as it was when it launched, the new models just have blood oxygen disabled.<br/>

<h2>RCS Support</h2><br/>
Last year, Apple announced that it would <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/16/apple-to-adopt-rcs-messaging-standard/">support the cross-platform messaging standard RCS (Rich Communication Services)</a> in the Messages app starting "later" in 2024, so it will likely be an iOS 18 feature based on that timeframe.<br/>
<br/>
RCS support should result in the following improvements to the default messaging experience between iPhones and Android devices:<br/>
<br/>
<ul><br/>
 <li>Higher-resolution photos and videos</li><br/>
 <li>Audio messages</li><br/>
 <li>Typing indicators</li><br/>
 <li>Read receipts</li><br/>
 <li>Wi-Fi messaging</li><br/>
 <li>Improved group chats, including the ability for iPhone users to leave a conversation that includes Android users</li></li><br/>
</ul><br/>
<br/>
These features are already available for iMessage conversations with blue bubbles, and RCS will extend the capabilities to green bubbles over both Wi-Fi and cellular networks. It is expected that SMS will remain available as a fallback option.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Per-Word Effects</h2><br/>
Apple plans to add a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/31/ios-18-imessage-text-effects/">per-word text effects option</a> to the Messages app on iOS 18, multiple sources familiar with the matter told <em>MacRumors</em>.<br/>
<br/>
While it is already possible to send iMessages with entire-bubble or full-screen effects, such as invisible ink or confetti, the text effects would allow you to animate individual words within a message. Our hope is that Apple will also add bold, italics, and underline formatting options, but we have not confirmed that possibility.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Suggested Replies</h2><br/>
iOS 18 will add AI-generated suggested replies to the Messages app, according to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/26/10-ai-features-coming-in-ios-18/"><em>Bloomberg</em></a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/30/more-details-about-ios-18s-ai-features-revealed/"><em>AppleInsider</em></a>. This feature would analyze recent messages in a conversation and provide a few suggested replies that users could tap on to send.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Custom Emoji</h2><br/>
Another rumored AI-powered feature is the option to send <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/26/10-ai-features-coming-in-ios-18/">custom emoji that are automatically generated</a> based on the context of recent messages.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Message Recaps</h2><br/>
iOS 18 is rumored to provide <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/26/10-ai-features-coming-in-ios-18/">AI-generated recaps of information</a> from several apps, including recent messages received in the Messages app.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>New Tapback Icons</h2><br/>
Tapback icons (the heart, thumbs up, thumbs down, "haha," exclamation marks, and question mark that can be added to messages) may be redesigned on iOS 18, <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman said in his latest <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-06-02/apple-ipad-pro-m4-chip-review-company-inches-closer-to-laptops-with-new-tablets-lwxjbna0"><em>Power On</em> newsletter</a>.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/messages/">Messages</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/03/ios-18-rumored-features-for-messages-app/">iOS 18 Rumored to Add These 6 New Features to iPhone&#039;s Messages App</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-18-rumored-to-add-these-6-new-features-to-iphones-messages-app.2428029/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple has seemingly updated its <a href="https://www.apple.com/ipad-air/specs/">tech specs webpage</a> for the latest M2 iPad Air models to indicate the M2 chip has a 9-core GPU, rather than 10 cores as previously stated.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/M2-iPad-Air-Hero-Feature-Orange.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-949534" /><br/>
The change was first reported by <em><a href="https://9to5mac.com/2024/06/01/m2-ipad-air-gpu-core-count/">9to5Mac</a></em>. Based on available web snapshots, the update to Apple's US website was made within the last 10 days. However, the equivalent webpage on many of Apple's regional stores still lists the M2 iPad Air as having a 10-core GPU. <br/>
<br/>
Apple's <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2024/05/apple-unveils-the-redesigned-11-inch-and-all-new-13-inch-ipad-air-with-m2/">press release</a> originally announcing the product on its Newsroom also mirrors the original 10-core spec, as does <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/119894">support documentation</a> for the device.  <br/>
<br/>
Apple has not commented on the change, which, if accurate, makes the new iPad Air the first M2-based Apple device with a 9-core GPU. Since the change went live on Apple's site, the going theory is that Apple's processor yield of 10-core chips was not sufficient, so it is using a "binned" version of the 10-core chip with one of the GPU cores disabled. The practice of "binning" is sometimes used to optimize processor yields and reduce waste. <br/>
<br/>
In all likelihood, every M2 iPad Air model that Apple has sold includes a 9-core GPU, and Apple is simply updating its product information for accuracy. Any real-world performance difference between an M2 iPad Air with a 9-core versus a 10-core GPU would have arguably been unnoticeable to most users. Even so, some customers will probably want to know why Apple's marketing materials were mistaken.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/">iPad Air </a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPad-Air">iPad Air (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipad.137">iPad</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/03/apple-says-m2-ipad-air-9-gpu-cores-not-10/">Apple Says M2 iPad Air Has 9 GPU Cores, Not 10 as Originally Stated</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-says-m2-ipad-air-has-9-gpu-cores-not-10-as-originally-stated.2428016/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Justin Long, the face of Apple's iconic <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0eEG5LVXdKo">"I'm a Mac" commercials</a>, now stars in a short Qualcomm skit promoting Snapdragon-powered PCs.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5R3QpKMciEw?si=gr4XADXs59lte8Ku&amp;start=4626" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><br/>
At the Computex 2024 keynote, Qualcomm unveiled the new skit featuring Long, who is well-known for his role in Apple's "Get a Mac" commercials nearly two decades ago. Long is depicted as being overwhelmed by a barrage of notifications about app compatibility, low disk space, and battery issues in macOS, prompting him to search for an alternative in the form of a Windows on ARM PC. The ad concludes with Long stating, "Things change," a sentiment echoed by Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon during the event's closing remarks. Qualcomm's Snapdragon X Elite chips debut in new Copilot Plus PCs on June 18.<br/>
<br/>
Long's participation in the skit is the latest development in a series of marketing strategies where tech companies use his association with the "I'm a Mac" persona to promote their products. The trend began in 2017 when Huawei featured Long in an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2017/01/31/justin-long-joins-huawei-ad-campaign/">ad for its Mate 9 smartphone</a>. In 2021, Intel also employed Long to create commercials that praised PCs and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/17/justin-long-get-a-mac-intel-ad-campaign/">mocked various aspects of Apple's M1 MacBooks</a>, including the Touch Bar and its limited color options.<br/>
<br/>
Apple launched the original "Get a Mac" ad campaign in 2006. Long played a personified Mac, characterized as easygoing and efficient, while John Hodgman portrayed a PC, depicted as conformist and prone to problems like viruses and system crashes. The ads ran for three years and consisted of 66 different commercials, although Long revealed in 2019 that approximately 300 were filmed.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/qualcomm/">Qualcomm</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/03/im-a-mac-snapdragon-pc-skit/">Qualcomm Enlists &#039;I&#039;m a Mac&#039; Ad Star for Snapdragon PC Skit</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/qualcomm-enlists-im-a-mac-ad-star-for-snapdragon-pc-skit.2428015/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Sonos in May decided to get into the headphone market with the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/21/hands-on-sonos-ace-headphones/">launch of the Sonos Ace headphones</a>. The &#36;449 Sonos Ace headphones have some enticing design elements and features you won't see in Apple's headphones, so we thought we'd compare them to the &#36;549 <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-max/">AirPods Max</a> to see which is ultimately better.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe title="13" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xzG_OcEjNw8" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe><em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/macrumors?sub_confirmation=1">Subscribe to the MacRumors YouTube channel</a> for more videos.</em></div><br/>
In terms of design, both the Sonos Ace and &zwnj;AirPods Max&zwnj; are over-ear headphones that have a premium look, but the &zwnj;AirPods Max&zwnj; have a fancier feel because of the aluminum material. While Apple opted for brushed aluminum ear cups in a range of colors, Sonos went for recycled plastic in either black or white.<br/>
<br/>
Both have a minimal aesthetic, but the lack of aluminum makes the Sonos Ace lighter and more comfortable to wear. The &zwnj;AirPods Max&zwnj; are 13.6 ounces, and the Sonos Ace weigh 11 ounces. Two ounces might not sound like a lot, but it impacts comfort. The &zwnj;AirPods Max&zwnj; also tend to clamp tightly to the head, which the Sonos Ace don't do, so it's just easier overall to wear the Sonos Ace with the gentler fit.<br/>
<br/>
The ear cups on the Sonos Ace are made from memory foam covered with vegan leather, and Apple's ear cups are made from a mesh acoustic fabric that's supposed to better conduct sound than other materials. The soft Sonos Ace ear cups will probably be more comfortable for most people, but there might be less breathability just because of the nature of the fabric. Apple created a u-shaped mesh headband with telescoping arms, while the Sonos Ace uses the same vegan leather material also with telescoping arms.<br/>
<br/>
You can't fold the &zwnj;AirPods Max&zwnj;, and you also can't fold the Sonos Ace, but Sonos made a better case. It's slim, light, and offers full protection, unlike the unpopular case Apple offers with the &zwnj;AirPods Max&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
Sound quality is similar, but the Sonos app has an adjustable EQ for tweaking sound to your liking, which is something that can't be done on the &zwnj;AirPods Max&zwnj;. Both support spatial audio and Dolby Atmos, and Sonos' spatial audio is just as impressive as Apple's. The Active Noise Cancellation and Transparency options perform close to the same, and while Apple has the best Transparency mode, Sonos is right behind.<br/>
<br/>
You can pair the &zwnj;AirPods Max&zwnj; and the Sonos Ace to a TV set, but for the AirPods you'll need a &#36;129 <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a>, and for the Sonos Ace, you'll need the Arc Soundbar, which is &#36;719. Sonos plans to add Ace integration to its other soundbars, but none are cheap.<br/>
<br/>
Both pair to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>, and Mac with no additional hardware, but you get better connectivity with the &zwnj;AirPods Max&zwnj; thanks to fast switching and one tap pairing. It's more of a hassle to pair the Sonos Ace because it uses standard Bluetooth with no automatic pairing via <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/icloud/">iCloud</a>, so when you're changing devices, you'll need to manually reconnect.<br/>
<br/>
Sonos' headphones are several years newer than the &zwnj;AirPods Max&zwnj; at this point, and battery technology has improved. The &zwnj;AirPods Max&zwnj; only offer 20 hours of battery life with ANC and spatial audio turned on, while the Sonos Ace offer 30 hours of battery. Apple also hasn't updated the &zwnj;AirPods Max&zwnj; with USB-C, so they're still using the Lightning port that's being phased out. Unless you want to have to use a Lightning port for several more years, it's best to go with the Ace, another set of headphones, or wait for the &zwnj;AirPods Max&zwnj; USB-C refresh that's supposed to be coming later this year.<br/>
<br/>
Sonos priced the Ace &#36;100 cheaper than the &zwnj;AirPods Max&zwnj;, but it's pretty easy to find the &zwnj;AirPods Max&zwnj; at a discount these days. If you can live without quick pairing, automatic switching, and the Apple aesthetic, the Sonos Ace offer the same sound quality and ANC, plus they're more comfortable.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's upcoming iPhone 16 Pro models will have the thinnest bezels of any smartphone, beating the screen border thinness of even its latest iPhone 15 Pro devices. That's according to the leaker known as "Ice Universe," who has divulged accurate information about Apple's plans in the past.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/iPhone-16-Pro-Front-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-928695" /><br/>
According to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/16/iphone-16-display-sizes/">multiple sources</a>, despite minimal design changes, both iPhone 16 Pro models will increase in size this year. The iPhone 16 Pro is said to be 6.3 inches (up from 6.1), while the iPhone 16 Pro Max is expected to measure in at 6.9 inches (up from 6.7), potentially making it Apple's biggest iPhone ever. <br/>
<br/>
But it seems that Apple isn't just relying on larger physical dimensions to make the viewing experience more immersive. <a href="https://x.com/UniverseIce/status/1797408311513600503">According to Ice Universe</a>, this year's Pro models will also have reduced bezels that could be the thinnest yet seen on any smartphone, including those on the Samsung Galaxy S24. <br/>
<br/>
The breakthrough for achieving this could be Apple's rumored use of Border Reduction Structure (BRS) technology, which allows for a more compact and efficient layout of the circuitry under the display, resulting in even slimmer bezels. Ice Universe did not mention BRS, but <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/04/iphone-16-even-thinner-bezels/">two</a> <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/20/iphone-16-ultra-thin-bezels-rumor/">rumors</a> out of Asia have referenced the technology in relation to iPhone 16 models.<br/>

Last year, Apple reduced the bezels on iPhone 15 Pro models using low-injection pressure over-molding, or LIPO, to shrink the display border size to 1.5 millimeters (versus around 2.2 millimeters on iPhone 14 models). Besides that, Apple has not significantly tweaked iPhone screen sizes since the introduction of the ‌‌iPhone‌‌ 12 models in 2020. But as mentioned, things are set to change with the Pro models in the 2024 iPhone 16 lineup. <div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/">iPhone 16 Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/universeice/">UniverseIce</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/03/iphone-16-pro-thinnest-bezels-smartphone/">iPhone 16 Pro Could Break Record for Thinnest Bezels on a Smartphone</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-16-pro-could-break-record-for-thinnest-bezels-on-a-smartphone.2428008/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[<em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-06-02/apple-ipad-pro-m4-chip-review-company-inches-closer-to-laptops-with-new-tablets-lwxjbna0">does not expect</a> Apple to announce any new hardware during its <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/28/wwdc-2024-full-schedule/">WWDC 2024 keynote on June 10</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/10/apple-tv-4k-yellow-bg-feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-870258" /><br/>
"There's no hardware slated to be announced at WWDC, unless Apple unexpectedly previews a new device launching later (to be clear: I don't expect that)," said Gurman, in his <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-06-02/apple-ipad-pro-m4-chip-review-company-inches-closer-to-laptops-with-new-tablets-lwxjbna0"><em>Power On</em> newsletter today</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Notably, Gurman now says a new Apple TV model "isn't imminent," despite previously reporting that Apple was aiming to release a new Apple TV <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/01/18/apple-tv-faster-chip-2024-launch/">in the first half of 2024</a>. The current Apple TV was introduced in October 2022.<br/>
<br/>
Here is when the previous five Apple TV models were announced:<br/>
<br/>
<ul><li><strong>Third-generation Apple TV 4K:</strong> October 2022</li><br/>
<li><strong>Second-generation Apple TV 4K:</strong> April 2021</li><br/>
<li><strong>First-generation Apple TV 4K:</strong> September 2017</li><br/>
<li><strong>Apple TV HD:</strong> September 2015</li><br/>
<li><strong>Third-generation Apple TV:</strong> March 2012</li></ul><br/>
<br/>
The next Apple TV is rumored to feature a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/01/18/apple-tv-faster-chip-2024-launch/">faster processor</a> than the current A15 Bionic chip, and even lower pricing. Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo suggested that the next Apple TV <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/10/18/kuo-even-cheaper-apple-tv/">could have a &#36;99 starting price</a> in the U.S., down from &#36;129 currently.<br/>
<br/>
No major design changes have been rumored for the next Apple TV specifically, but Gurman said Apple has considered <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/07/apple-tv-with-camera-again-rumored/">adding a built-in camera</a> to a future model. tvOS 17 <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/use-iphone-facetime-camera-apple-tv/">added a FaceTime app to the Apple TV</a>, allowing for users to have video calls on the TV, but this currently requires using the rear camera on a connected iPhone or iPad.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/wwdc/">WWDC 2024</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-inc-and-tech-industry.8">Apple, Inc and Tech Industry</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/02/gurman-no-new-hardware-at-wwdc-2024/">Gurman: No Hardware at WWDC, Next Apple TV No Longer Coming Soon</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/gurman-no-hardware-at-wwdc-next-apple-tv-no-longer-coming-soon.2427954/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Best Buy has a huge collection of discounts on Apple's MacBook Air this weekend, including both the previous generation M2 models from 2022 and the brand new M3 computers that launched this year. In regards to the M2 models, you'll find the best deals at Amazon.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>M2 MacBook Air</h2><br/>
Amazon today has every model of the 2022 13-inch MacBook Air available for &#36;170 off, representing new all-time low prices on the notebooks. These prices are available to all shoppers and do not require a coupon code.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/04/macbook-air-bb-blue.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-946063" /><em><small>Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with some of these vendors. When you click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment, which helps us keep the site running.</small></em><br/>
<br/>
The 256GB model is on sale for <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0B3BVWJ6Y%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"><strong>&#36;829.00</strong></a> and the 512GB model is available for <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0B3CGXWN4%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"><strong>&#36;1,029.00</strong></a>. These deals beat the previous prices we tracked earlier in the year by about &#36;50.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0B3BVWJ6Y%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"target="_blank"><div class="fancybutton"><div class="fancybadge">&#36;170 OFF</div>13-inch M2 MacBook Air (256GB) for &#36;829.00</div></a></div><br/>

<br/>
You can get both models in all four colors: Starlight, Space Gray, Silver, and Midnight. Following the introduction of the M3 MacBook Air, Apple knocked the price of the 13-inch M2 MacBook Air down by &#36;100, and it's still selling them alongside the M3 model.<br/>
<h2>M3 MacBook Air</h2><br/>
You can find all-time low prices across the 15-inch M3 MacBook Air lineup at Best Buy, including up to &#36;100 off these 2024 computers. Prices start at <a href="https://howl.me/cmlTyg65W53"><strong>&#36;1,199.00</strong></a> for the 256GB model, and include both 512GB versions of the computer as well.<br/>

Apple's keynote will kick things off on June 10 at 10 a.m. Pacific Time, with <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a> and other major software updates expected to be announced.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Apple Now Selling Refurbished iPhone 14 Models</h2><br/>
Apple this week began <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/24/apple-now-selling-refurbished-iphone-14-models/">selling refurbished iPhone 14, iPhone 14 Plus, iPhone 14 Pro, and iPhone 14 Pro Max models</a> in the U.S. and some other countries for the first time since the devices were released in September 2022. The models quickly sold out, but inventory should be replenished over time.<br/>
<br/>

Apple's refurbished iPhones come with a new battery, outer shell, and box, along with a charging cable.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>These 10 New AI Features Are Reportedly Coming in iOS 18</h2><br/>
iOS 18 is widely rumored to add a wide range of new AI features to the iPhone, and a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/26/10-ai-features-coming-in-ios-18/">new report has provided more details about what to expect</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/04/iOS-18-Apple-Music-Messages-and-Notes-Feature-1.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-948782" /><br/>
The new features will allegedly include AI-powered photo retouching, voice memo transcription, suggested replies to emails and messages, auto-generated custom emojis based on the content of a user's messages, improved Safari web search, and much more.<br/>
<br/>
On <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/31/the-macrumors-show-new-ios-18-rumors/">this week's episode of The MacRumors Show</a>, Dan and Hartley discuss a wide array of rumors about iOS 18 across Apple's built-in apps and beyond.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>What to Expect From CarPlay on iOS 18</h2><br/>
iOS 18 will include some <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/29/what-to-expect-from-carplay-on-ios-18/">new features for Apple's in-vehicle software system CarPlay</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/Apple-CarPlay-Dash.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-934995" /><br/>
In a press release earlier this month, Apple highlighted three new accessibility features coming to CarPlay as part of the update, including Sound Recognition, Voice Control, and Color Filters. In addition, Apple's website says the first vehicles with <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/13/apple-next-generation-carplay-recap/">next-generation CarPlay</a> will arrive in 2024, so that rollout could coincide with iOS 18.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Beats Solo Buds Available to Order June 18, Launch June 20</h2><br/>
Beats Solo Buds were <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/30/beats-solo-buds-announced/">first announced in April</a>, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/29/beats-solo-buds-launch-date/">now Apple has shared availability details</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/04/beats-solo-buds-red-pairing.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-948608" /><br/>
Apple says the Solo Buds will be <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/29/beats-solo-buds-launch-date/">available to order on June 18, and launch on June 20</a>. Priced at &#36;79.99, the wireless earbuds feature up to 18 hours of battery life, a USB-C carrying case, and Find My support on iOS and Android. However, they lack active noise cancellation, and the carrying case does not have a built-in battery.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>New Beats Pill Speaker Listed on Apple's Regulatory Website</h2><br/>
After appearing <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/20/lebron-james-unreleased-beats-pill/">alongside famous athletes</a>, in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/07/apple-beats-pill-ios-17-5/">iOS 17.5 code</a>, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/21/beats-pill-fcc-database/">in the FCC database</a>, a new Beats Pill speaker has now been <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/28/new-beats-pill-speaker-on-apple-regulatory-website/">listed on Apple's regulatory compliance website</a> for Europe.<br/>
<br/>

Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/01/10/beats-pill-discontinued/">discontinued the previous Beats Pill+ speaker</a> in 2022. The new version is likely to feature a USB-C charging port, support for a newer Bluetooth version, a built-in lanyard option, longer battery life, and more.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[While Apple refreshed the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a> and the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/">iPad Air</a> in May, the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-mini/">iPad mini</a> is still in need of an update. Apple last introduced a new &zwnj;iPad mini&zwnj; in September 2021, so it's overdue for an overhaul.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/ipad-mini-blue-2.jpg" alt="" width="1607" height="905" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-937844" /><br/>
Rumors suggest that Apple has plans to refresh its smallest tablet in 2024, and this guide highlights all of the rumors we've heard about the device so far.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="display_and_design">Display and Design</h2><br/>
We haven't heard rumors of design changes for the &zwnj;iPad mini&zwnj;, which means it will likely feature the same 8.3-inch size and all-display design. The current &zwnj;iPad mini&zwnj; has a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/touch-id/">Touch ID</a> Power Button, which we're also expecting for the new model.<br/>
<br/>
According to a 2023 rumor, Apple will <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/13/jelly-scrolling-reduced-on-ipad-mini-7/">make a small tweak</a> to the &zwnj;iPad mini&zwnj;'s display in an effort to cut down on "jelly scrolling." The screen assembly will be rotated, which is supposed to reduce the effect when using the &zwnj;iPad mini&zwnj; in portrait orientation.<br/>
<br/>
Jelly scrolling refers to noticeable lag when scrolling vertically through text-based context like a webpage. Each line appears to tilt downward toward the left of the screen as it passes, which makes it look like one side of the display is responding faster. Apple says that this is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/28/apple-jelly-scrolling-normal-behavior/">normal behavior</a> for LCD iPads, but the company still wants to make a change to minimize the effect.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="a-series_chip">A-Series Chip</h2><br/>
The &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; and the &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; have M-series chips, but we're not expecting the &zwnj;iPad mini&zwnj; to get a Mac chip this year. Instead, Apple is likely to go with the A17 Pro that was used in the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a> models, or some other A17 variant.<br/>
<br/>
It's also possible that the &zwnj;iPad mini&zwnj; will get an A18 chip if it comes after the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a> lineup, as rumors suggest the &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; models will have chips in the A18 family.<br/>
<br/>
With an A17 Pro or better, the &zwnj;iPad mini&zwnj; would be on par with or faster than the &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; models, but it won't have the speeds of the &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; or &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
Apple is overhauling <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a> and iPadOS 18 with a focus on AI, so high powered chips are a must for upcoming devices.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="new_colors">New Colors</h2><br/>
The &zwnj;iPad mini&zwnj; is available in space gray, starlight, pink, and purple right now. Apple often refreshes color options with updates, so new colors are a definite possibility. With the &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj;, which the &zwnj;iPad mini&zwnj; often mimics, Apple got rid of pink.<br/>
<br/>
If Apple makes the &zwnj;iPad mini&zwnj; available in the same colors as the &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj;, it could come in space gray, purple, blue, and starlight.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="front_camera">Front Camera</h2><br/>
Apple moved the front-facing camera on the &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; to the landscape edge of the device, and it could make the same change for the &zwnj;iPad mini&zwnj;. It may make less sense to have a landscape camera on an &zwnj;iPad mini&zwnj;, though, because it's less often used with keyboards.<br/>
<br/>
The camera could get support for HDR 4 and it could have a wider aperture, if it adopts the camera used in the &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="connectivity">Connectivity</h2><br/>
Apple has been adding Wi-Fi 6E to each product as it's updated, and it should be the &zwnj;iPad mini&zwnj;'s turn this year. Wi-Fi 6E will allow the &zwnj;iPad mini&zwnj; to connect to the 6GHz Wi-Fi network on supported routers.<br/>
<br/>
Bluetooth 5.3 is also expected, as that's another update Apple has been making to new devices, and the &zwnj;iPad mini&zwnj; could lose its nano-SIM slot, with Apple opting only for eSIM.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="apple_pencil_pro">Apple Pencil Pro</h2><br/>
The current &zwnj;iPad mini&zwnj; works with the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-pencil/">Apple Pencil</a> 2, so the new model will likely support the &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; Pro. The &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; Pro has a squeeze gesture, haptic feedback, a gyroscope for barrel roll support, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/find-my-network-accessory-program/">Find My</a> integration.<br/>
<br/>
&zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; hover might also be a new feature, as the current &zwnj;iPad mini&zwnj; does not support it.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="release_date">Release Date</h2><br/>
Apple will likely release a new &zwnj;iPad mini&zwnj; toward the end of the year, likely in September or October. In some years, Apple holds a special October event for Macs and iPads, and we could get that in 2024.<br/>
<br/>
MacBook Pro models, the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-mini/">Mac mini</a>, and the low-cost <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> could all be refreshed alongside the &zwnj;iPad mini&zwnj; in the fall.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="future_ipad_mini_models">Future iPad mini Models</h2><br/>
There are rumors that Apple is working on a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/02/apple-foldable-2026-could-replace-ipad-mini/">foldable iPad mini</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/11/apple-planning-to-bring-oled-to-ipad-mini-and-air/">OLED display technology</a> for the &zwnj;iPad mini&zwnj;, but neither of these updates are expected in 2024.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Rumors from multiple reliable sources suggest that Apple is working on a MacBook that has a foldable screen, and it could in fact be Apple's first foldable device, coming before a foldable <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>. We've rounded up six key features that we've heard about the device so far.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/Foldable-Screen-MacBook-Concept-Astropad.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="576" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-952144" /><em>Concept by <a href="https://astropad.com/foldable-mac-screen/">Astropad</a></em></div><br/>
<h2>Design</h2><br/>
The all-display design of the foldable MacBook would be distinct from the current MacBook, which has a display and keyboard. It would feature a single large screen that's able to be folded in half.<br/>
<br/>
When unfolded, the MacBook could be used as a monitor when paired with a keyboard and a trackpad or mouse, and when folded, it could serve as a notebook machine. Presumably this kind of design would not have a separate keyboard, instead using an on-screen keyboard with digital keys and haptic feedback for a key-like feel.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Size</h2><br/>
Display research analyst Ross Young claims the foldable MacBook will have <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/23/18-8-inch-foldable-macbook-rumor/">an 18.8-inch display</a>, with Apple aiming to make the screen "as crease-free as possible" when it is unfolded. Apple analyst <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/">Ming-Chi Kuo</a> has also suggested Apple is planning for a screen around 19 inches.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Display Technology</h2><br/>
Apple has been rumored to be <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/04/01/foldable-oled-ipads-and-macbooks-in-development/">working with LG Display</a> to develop a foldable OLED panel, and LG has been developing foldable ultra-thin cover glass for the last several years.<br/>
<br/>
Apple has also tested <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/05/17/kuo-apple-testing-eink-display-foldable-devices/">electronic paper display</a> (EPD) technology that it could use in future foldable devices. EPD could potentially be used in the outer-most display in a foldable device, if Apple goes with some kind of dual display design with an outside and inside screen.<br/>
<br/>
EPD is a form of e-ink technology, which is known for being much more viewable than LED or OLED screens in bright light.<br/>
<br/>
At an 18.8-inch size, the foldable notebook would likely have a 5K or higher resolution.<br/>
<h2>M-Series Chip</h2><br/>
Mass production on foldable display panels for a future MacBook could begin in the fourth quarter of 2025 for a launch in late 2025 or early 2026. That would be timed with the future M5 chip, a successor to the 2024 M4.<br/>
<br/>
We don't know what to expect from the M5, but it is likely to be manufactured on a next-generation 3-nanometer node or even a 2-nanometer node. TSMC is working on 2nm chips, and they're supposed to be ready somewhere around the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/24/apple-tsmc-first-2nm-chips/">second half of 2025</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/3nm/">3nm</a> and 2nm reference the architecture that TSMC is using for its chips, and a decrease in node size corresponds to a decrease in transistor size, allowing more transistors to fit on a processor. This often results in faster performance and better energy efficiency. Right now, Apple's M4 chips are built on a 3-nanometer mode, much like the M3 chips.<br/>
<h2>Price</h2><br/>
Apple will need to use high-cost components for the foldable MacBook, and Kuo believes it could be <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/23/20-inch-foldable-macbook-crease-free-rumor/">almost as expensive</a> as the &#36;3,500 Vision Pro headset when it launches. The 16-inch MacBook Pro currently starts at &#36;2,500, so presumably the larger foldable model would be more expensive than that.<br/>
<h2>Release Date</h2><br/>
If rumors are accurate and Apple is planning to have LG Display begin mass production on a foldable MacBook in the fourth quarter of 2025, the device could launch in 2025 or 2026. Kuo estimates that Apple will ship more than one million units in 2026.<br/>
<br/>
Apple analyst Ross Young believes that a foldable MacBook could come <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/01/31/apple-foldable-notebook-2025/">as soon as 2025</a>, the same timeline suggested by <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/23/18-8-inch-foldable-macbook-rumor/">analyst Jeff Pu</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Rumors about a foldable MacBook have been all over the place, however, and just two months prior to suggesting a Q4 2025 mass production schedule, Kuo said a foldable MacBook wouldn't come until 2027. It's best not to read too much into launch date rumors at this point, because Apple's plans could change.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/31/foldable-macbook-rumor-recap/">Foldable MacBooks: Six Things to Know About Apple&#039;s Future Plans</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/foldable-macbooks-six-things-to-know-about-apples-future-plans.2427855/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[With the upcoming <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-15/">macOS 15</a> updates, Apple plans to streamline the Settings app, <a href="https://x.com/markgurman/status/1796399911526920509"><em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman</a> confirmed today. He said that while it's not a "huge deal," there are some changes planned.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/iOS-18-WWDC-24-Feature-1.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-944196" /><br/>
The Settings app on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> and the System Settings on Macs will get an updated UI with a "reorganized, cleaner layout" that's simpler to navigate. Search in the Settings app is also set to improve, and that's been a major issue with prior versions of iOS and macOS.<br/>
<br/>
On iOS specifically, searching for an option in the Settings app often returns no results or the wrong result. A search for "Charging Optimization," a setting on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a> models, does not bring up the interface, for example. There are several other smaller settings options that are similarly inaccessible when searching.<br/>
<br/>
Part of the changes planned for &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj; and &zwnj;macOS 15&zwnj; include major updates to Spotlight and search throughout the operating systems, as well as an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/30/ai-siri-features-ios-18-2025/">overhauled version of Siri</a> that is able to control all individual features in apps. Combined, these updates should make it easier to get to some of the more hidden settings on Apple devices.<br/>
<br/>
A prior rumor suggested that Apple would <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/23/macos-15-system-settings-design/">overhaul the macOS System Settings app</a>, introducing rearranged menus and app UIs in an update that will be the biggest since the Settings app was refreshed in macOS Ventura. On the Mac, Apple is said to be using an organizational system focused on "priority and overall importance," and the same changes could be made on iOS as well.<br/>
<br/>
The Notifications and Sound categories in System Settings will be moved lower in the list, with General settings moved up under Network settings. Wallpaper and Displays will join General settings, and Privacy and Security will be paired with <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/touch-id/">Touch ID</a> and Password.<br/>
<br/>
Apple is also planning to refresh <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/31/ios-18-control-center-updates-rumor/">the Control Center</a> on &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj; and Apple has been testing the changes internally, but specific updates are unclear at this time.<br/>
<br/>
More on the features that are coming to iOS and macOS can be found in our <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-15/">macOS 15</a> roundups, which are updated regularly with all of the new rumors that we've heard.<br/>
<br/>
The 2024 Worldwide Developers Conference keynote is set to take place on Monday, June 10, with Apple unveiling &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj;, &zwnj;macOS 15&zwnj;, and also iPadOS 18, tvOS 18, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/visionos/">visionOS</a> 2, and watchOS 11.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-15/">macOS 15</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/31/ios-18-refreshed-settings-app/">iOS 18 and macOS 15 to Feature Refreshed Settings App</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-18-and-macos-15-to-feature-refreshed-settings-app.2427850/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today made three changes to its <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/102772">vintage and obsolete products list</a>, involving the iPhone 5s, sixth-generation iPod touch, and an older iMac model.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/iPhone-5s-16x9.jpeg" alt="" width="1280" height="720" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-952997" /><br/>
First, Apple now considers the iPhone 5s to be an "obsolete" product worldwide, meaning that Apple Stores and Apple Authorized Service Providers no longer offer repairs or other hardware service for the device. Apple says it considers a product "obsolete" once seven years have passed since the company last distributed it for sale.<br/>
<br/>
Apple released the iPhone 5s in September 2013, with its key new feature being the Touch ID fingerprint sensor built into the Home button. The device also introduced the A7 chip, which was Apple's first iPhone chip with 64-bit architecture.<br/>
<br/>
Second, the sixth-generation iPod touch and the late 2015 edition of the 21.5-inch iMac with a Retina 4K display are now classified as "vintage" products, as more than five years have passed since the company stopped distributing the devices for sale. Apple Stores and Apple Authorized Service Providers can continue to offer repairs for vintage products for up to two more years, but only if the necessary parts remain available.<br/>
<br/>
The sixth-generation iPod touch was released in 2015, and it was the second-last model of the device. Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/05/10/apple-discontinues-ipod-touch/">discontinued the iPod touch line</a> in 2022.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/vintage-and-obsolete/">Vintage and Obsolete Apple Products</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/31/apple-says-iphone-5s-now-obsolete/">Apple Says iPhone 5s Now Obsolete as iPod Touch 6 Becomes &#039;Vintage&#039;</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-says-iphone-5s-now-obsolete-as-ipod-touch-6-becomes-vintage.2427839/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[For this week's giveaway, we've teamed up with <a href="https://gridstudio.cc">GRID Studio</a> to offer <em>MacRumors</em> readers a chance to win an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a>. For those unfamiliar with GRID Studio, it is a small company that crafts art out of old, discarded Apple products.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/grid_frame_studio_1st_iphone_10.jpg" alt="" width="1400" height="788" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-952967" /><br/>
GRID Studio buys and recycles old electronics, taking them apart and arranging each component carefully under a glass frame. Their work turns a hodgepodge of parts into display pieces designed for Apple enthusiasts who want to own a piece of Apple's history.<br/>
<br/>
The &#36;400 <a href="https://gridstudio.cc/products/iphone-1st-generation">GRID 1</a> is perhaps GRID Studio's most iconic offering, featuring the original Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> from 2007. The GRID 1 includes all of the components of the first &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;, complete with labeling and interesting facts like all of GRID's pieces. The original &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;'s unmistakable housing is displayed next to the button, headphone socket, speaker, logic board, ear piece, and other components, and it's particularly interesting because it was before the days when Apple started making its own chips.<br/>
<br/>
The <a href="https://gridstudio.cc/products/grid%C2%AE4s">GRID 4S</a> is an affordable way to get a piece of GRID Studio's art, as it's on sale for &#36;99 this week. The GRID 4S was the final &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; that was introduced while Steve Jobs was still alive, and the first &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tim-cook/">Tim Cook</a> launched without Jobs. The "S" stood for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a>, and it was the first &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; that included the &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; personal assistant.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/grid-studio-iphone-4S.jpg" alt="" width="2959" height="1664" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-952965" /><br/>
For Mac fans, the &#36;600 <a href="https://gridstudio.cc/products/grid-macbook-air-1st-generation">GRID MacBook Air</a> showcases the first-generation <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/">MacBook Air</a> that Apple released, and it is one of GRID Studio's larger pieces at 30 inches by 18.5 inches. At the time, the 2008 &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; was marketed world's thinnest notebook computer, and it is definitely one of Apple's most well-known later-stage Macs.<br/>
<br/>
The GRID &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; has the machine's display at the top, followed by all of the interior components, and then the keyboard and trackpad combo. The hard drive, fan, network card, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe-battery-pack/">MagSafe</a> components are all neatly displayed, and it's a fun look at some vintage components that Apple has long since abandoned.<br/>
<br/>

This includes new record low prices on the 10th generation iPad and M2 iPad Air, and a sale on the Apple Watch Ultra 2.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[On this week's episode of <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/podcast/new-ios-18-leaks-rumors-ahead-of-wwdc-2024/id1602394741?i=1000657420444">The MacRumors Show</a>, we discuss some of the latest rumors about <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a>, including deeper <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/home-screen/">Home Screen</a> customization, AI-generated emojis, and more.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/G6-3eNxaCNI?si=aH34d4pRK3bz5vAO" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@themacrumorsshow?sub_confirmation=1">Subscribe to The MacRumors Show YouTube channel</a> for more videos</em></div><br/>
With &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj;, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a> is expected to undergo a substantial overhaul with improved natural language processing, enabling more conversational interactions and proactive intelligence. The assistant will apparently understand and perform more complex tasks within apps. These tasks range from moving notes between folders and deleting emails to summarizing articles and recent notifications.<br/>
<br/>
Spotlight search will also allegedly see similar enhancements, integrating deeper with system-wide information to provide more intelligent and relevant results. In Messages, AI will suggest responses and create custom emojis based on message content. The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/photos/">Photos</a> app will incorporate AI-powered retouching tools and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/">Apple Music</a> will offer auto-generated playlists and smoother song transitions.<br/>
<br/>
&zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj; is also expected to introduce a more customizable &zwnj;Home Screen&zwnj;. Users will have the freedom to place app icons anywhere on the grid and change app icon colors.<br/>
<br/>
Safari is expected to gain an Intelligent Search option, summarizing key topics and phrases on web pages, and a new Web Eraser tool, which allows users to remove unwanted portions of websites. The Calculator app will be redesigned to include recent calculations and better unit conversion tools, becoming a universal app for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>, and Mac. <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-maps/">Apple Maps</a> will introduce custom routes and topographic maps, enhancing navigation and outdoor activities.<br/>
<br/>
Accessibility is another focus area for &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj; with new features like Eye Tracking, which uses the front-facing camera to navigate the interface, and Vehicle Motion Cues, designed to reduce motion sickness. Music Haptics will provide tactile feedback in sync with music, and Vocal Shortcuts will enable users to assign custom phrases for &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; to execute complex tasks.<br/>
<br/>
The adoption of the Rich Communication Services (<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/rcs/">RCS</a>) standard should improve messaging between iPhones and Android devices with support for higher resolution photos, audio messages, typing indicators, read receipts, and improved group chat functionality. <br/>
<br/>
&zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj; is expected to be compatible with all iPhones that support <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a>, including models as old as the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; XR and &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; XS. However, iPadOS 18 may drop support for older models such as the first-generation 10.5-inch <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a> and the second-generation 12.9-inch &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj;. <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/the-macrumors-show/">The MacRumors Show</a> has <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@themacrumorsshow">its own YouTube channel</a>, so make sure you're subscribed to keep up with new episodes and clips:<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple plans to add a new text effects feature to the Messages app on iOS 18, according to multiple sources familiar with the matter.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/07/General-Apps-Messages.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1407" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-808613" /><br/>
While it is already possible to send iMessages with bubble effects or full-screen effects, such as invisible ink or confetti, the text effects would allow you to animate individual words within a message. With the Messages app <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/16/apple-to-adopt-rcs-messaging-standard/">set to gain RCS support</a> on iOS 18, it is possible the text effects will also work with green bubbles.<br/>
<br/>
Our hope is that Apple will also add bold, italics, and underline formatting options alongside the text effects, but we have not confirmed that possibility.<br/>
<br/>
In addition to the text effects and RCS support, the Messages app on iOS 18 will reportedly gain an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/22/apple-generative-ai-features-and-smarter-siri/">AI-powered autocompletion tool</a>.<br/>
<br/>
As a refresher, RCS support will provide an improved messaging experience between iPhones and Android devices compared to the current SMS standard. Just like iMessage, RCS features higher-resolution photos and videos, audio messages, typing indicators, read receipts, the ability to send messages over a Wi-Fi network, and better functionality for group chats.<br/>
<br/>
iOS 18 is set to be unveiled during the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/28/wwdc-2024-full-schedule/">WWDC keynote on June 10</a>, and the first beta should be made available to members of the Apple Developer Program immediately after the presentation. The first public beta of iOS 18 will likely follow in July, and the update should be widely released to all users with a compatible iPhone in September.<br/>
