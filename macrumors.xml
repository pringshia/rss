		<description><![CDATA[Apple has big plans for iOS 18, according to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-01-28/apple-eu-changes-sideloading-third-party-app-stores-are-future-of-the-iphone-lrxjzbg6"><em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/iOS-18-Mock-Feature-Baubles.jpg" alt="" width="2250" height="1266" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-909207" /><br/>
In the subscriber-only Q&A section of his <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-01-28/apple-eu-changes-sideloading-third-party-app-stores-are-future-of-the-iphone-lrxjzbg6"><em>Power On</em> newsletter</a> today, Gurman said iOS 18 has the potential to be the "biggest" software update in the iPhone's history.<br/>
<br/>
"I'm told that the new operating system is seen within the company as one of the biggest iOS updates — if not the biggest — in the company's history," he wrote.<br/>
<br/>
Gurman said he plans to share more details about specific iOS 18 features and changes that are planned in the future, but we already know about two new features that are likely to be included in the update, as outlined below.<br/>
<br/>
iOS 18 will be released in September, and the first beta for developers will come out during Apple's annual developers conference WWDC in June.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>RCS Support</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/07/General-Apps-Messages.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1407" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-808613" /><br/>
In November 2023, Apple announced that it would <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/16/apple-to-adopt-rcs-messaging-standard/">support the cross-platform messaging standard RCS</a> in the Messages app on the iPhone starting "later" in 2024, so it will likely be an iOS 18 feature based on that timeframe.<br/>
<br/>
RCS support should result in the following improvements to the default messaging experience between iPhones and Android devices:<ul><br/>
 <li>Higher-resolution photos and videos</li><br/>
 <li>Audio messages</li><br/>
 <li>Typing indicators</li><br/>
 <li>Read receipts</li><br/>
 <li>Wi-Fi messaging between iPhones and Android devices</li><br/>
 <li>Improved group chats, including the ability for iPhone users to leave a conversation that includes Android users</li><br/>
 <li>Improved encryption compared to SMS</li><br/>
</ul>These modern features are already available for iPhone-to-iPhone conversations with blue bubbles, via iMessage, and many of the features are also available in third-party messaging apps, such as WhatsApp and Telegram. RCS support on the iPhone will extend the features to green bubbles in the Messages app.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Smarter Siri</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/iOS-18-Mock-Siri-Feature-Baubles.jpg" alt="" width="2250" height="1266" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-909208" /><br/>
Gurman expects <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/22/apple-generative-ai-features-and-smarter-siri/">iOS 18 to feature generative AI technology</a> that "should improve how both Siri and the Messages app can field questions and auto-complete sentences." He said Apple has also explored generative AI features for other apps across its platforms, including Apple Music, Pages, Keynote, and Xcode.<br/>
<br/>
<em>The Information</em> reported that Apple plans to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/06/ios-18-siri-improvements/">incorporate large language models into Siri</a> to let users automate complex tasks, a feature that would involve deeper integration with the Shortcuts app. The report said this feature is expected to be released in an iPhone software update coming in 2024, which would likely be iOS 18.<br/>
<br/>
Generative AI surged in popularity in 2022 when OpenAI released ChatGPT, a chatbot that can respond to questions and other prompts. Google and Microsoft released similar chatbots last year, as more companies race into the space. The chatbots are trained on large language models, allowing them to respond like a human.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/28/ios-18-big-expectations/">iOS 18 Potentially &#039;Biggest&#039; Software Update in iPhone&#039;s History</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-18-potentially-biggest-software-update-in-iphones-history.2417674/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple will likely launch new iPad Air, iPad Pro, and MacBook Air models "around the end of March," according to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-01-28/apple-eu-changes-sideloading-third-party-app-stores-are-future-of-the-iphone-lrxjzbg6"><em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman</a></a>. In his <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-01-28/apple-eu-changes-sideloading-third-party-app-stores-are-future-of-the-iphone-lrxjzbg6"><em>Power On</em> newsletter</a> today, he said production is well underway for the new iPad Pro models and a new 13-inch MacBook Air at a minimum within Apple's supply chain in Asia.<br/>
 <br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/iPad-Air-12.9-Inch-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2192" height="1233" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-917813" /><br/>
Below, we reiterate Gurman's expectations for the new iPads and Macs, along with other rumored features and changes for the devices.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>iPad Air</h2><br/>
The iPad Air lineup is expected to gain a new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/10/12-9-inch-ipad-air-display-shipments/">12.9-inch display size</a> alongside an updated 10.9-inch model.<br/>
<br/>
Rumored and/or likely features for the next iPad Air models include Apple's M2 chip for faster performance, a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/20/next-gen-ipad-air-with-12-9-inch-display-and-redesigned-camera-unit-revealed-in-cad-renders/">redesigned rear camera bump</a>, Wi-Fi 6E support, and Bluetooth 5.3. No major external design changes are expected.<br/>
<br/>
The current fifth-generation iPad Air with the M1 chip was released in March 2022.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>iPad Pro</h2><br/>
The next 11-inch and 13-inch iPad Pro models are widely expected to be the first iPads equipped <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/16/oled-ipad-displays-enter-production/">with OLED displays</a>.<br/>
<br/>
OLED technology would enable the next iPad Pro displays to offer increased brightness, more vivid colors, higher contrast ratio, lower power consumption, and other benefits compared to existing models with LCD panels. Apple already uses OLED displays for the latest iPhone and Apple Watch models, excluding the lower-end iPhone SE.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/M3-iPad-Feature-3.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-917548" /><br/>
Due to the switch to OLED, the next iPad Pro models are expected to be more expensive.<br/>
<br/>
iPad Pro models released in 2017 and later support ProMotion, allowing for a variable refresh rate between 24Hz and 120Hz. OLED and LTPO display technology would likely allow for the refresh rate to drop down further to 10Hz or lower to save battery life. iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro models can reach as low as 1Hz while in always-on display mode.<br/>
<br/>
Other rumored and/or likely features for the next iPad Pro models include Apple's latest M3 chip for faster performance, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/18/ipad-pro-magsafe-charging/">MagSafe wireless charging</a>, a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/03/gurman-new-ipad-magic-keyboard-to-feature-aluminum/">redesigned Magic Keyboard</a> with a larger trackpad and an aluminum top casing, and a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/25/ipad-pro-landscape-face-id-camera/">landscape-oriented front camera</a>. There may also be rear camera design changes, like on the next iPad Air models.<br/>
<br/>
The current iPad Pro models with the M2 chip were released in October 2022.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>MacBook Air</h2><br/>
While the current 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Air launched a year apart due to production delays, the models should be updated simultaneously this March. The key new feature for the laptops will be Apple's latest M3 chip.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/03/macbook-air-spacegray-purple.jpg" alt="" width="1428" height="802" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-887878" /><br/>
With the M3 chip, the next MacBook Air models will gain hardware-accelerated ray tracing and mesh shading for improved graphics rendering in games, including more accurate lighting, reflections, and shadows. Apple already updated the 14-inch MacBook Pro, 16-inch MacBook Pro, and 24-inch iMac with the M3 chip last year.<br/>
<br/>
No major design changes are expected for the MacBook Air this year, but the laptop will likely gain support for Wi-Fi 6E like other Macs.<br/>
<br/>
Apple last updated the 13-inch MacBook Air in July 2022, while the first-ever 15-inch MacBook Air was released in June 2023.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/">iPad Air </a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/">MacBook Air</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPad-Air">iPad Air (Don't Buy)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#11-iPad-Pro">11" iPad Pro (Don't Buy)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#12-9-iPad-Pro">12.9" iPad Pro (Don't Buy)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#15-MacBook-Air">15" MacBook Air (Neutral)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Air">13" MacBook Air (Don't Buy)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipad.137">iPad</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macbook-air.122">MacBook Air</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/28/gurman-new-ipads-and-macs-in-late-march/">Gurman: New iPads and Macs Likely to Launch in Late March</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/gurman-new-ipads-and-macs-likely-to-launch-in-late-march.2417671/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Following the Apple Card savings account's recent <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/26/apple-savings-account-apy-increase/">rate increase to 4.5%</a>, we have updated our guide comparing the annual percentage yields (APYs) of some popular high-yield savings accounts (HYSAs) available to U.S. residents.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/apple-card-savings-account-feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-928948" /><br/>
Apple's rate now exceeds that of popular HYSAs offered by the likes of American Express, Capital One, and Discover, but there are a handful of other options that offer even higher APYs in the 4.6% to low 5% range, such as Synchrony Bank and Wealthfront. Balance limits and other requirements vary by provider.<br/>
<br/>
There are many other HYSAs not listed in our chart, so be sure to do your research before deciding which option is best suited for you.<br/>

<div class="clear"></div>* Advertised APYs as of January 27, 2024, excluding limited-time/affiliate rates. APYs may vary.<br/>
<br/>
These rates will continue to increase or decrease over time, often in line with U.S. Federal Reserve rate decisions. Money can be withdrawn from the Apple Card savings account and switched to a different HYSA at any time.<br/>
<br/>
Apple launched its savings account <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/17/apple-card-savings-account-launching-today/">in April 2023</a>, in partnership with Goldman Sachs. The account can be opened and managed in the Wallet app on the iPhone, and it has no fees, no minimum deposits, and no minimum balance requirements. You must have an Apple Card, be a U.S. resident, and be at least 18 years old to open an account.<br/>
<br/>
The account allows Apple Card holders to earn interest on their Daily Cash cashback balance, and on funds deposited via a linked bank account or an Apple Cash balance. The maximum balance allowed is &#36;250,000, which is lower than some HYSAs.<br/>
<br/>
To open a savings account in the Wallet app, tap on your Apple Card, tap on the circle with three dots at the top of the screen, tap Daily Cash, and select Set Up Savings.<br/>
<br/>
Goldman Sachs reportedly plans to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/28/apple-goldman-sachs-partnership-ending/">end its partnership with Apple</a>, but it is unclear how this might impact the Apple Card. In any case, balances up to the &#36;250,000 limit are fully insured by the U.S. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC).<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-card/">Apple Card</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/27/apple-card-savings-interest-rate-comparison/">Here&#039;s How the Apple Card&#039;s New Savings Rate Compares to Competitors</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/heres-how-the-apple-cards-new-savings-rate-compares-to-competitors.2417598/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Huge news this week for iOS users in the European Union, with major changes to Apple's policies coming with iOS 17.4 related to alternative app stores, default browsers, NFC payment options, and more.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/top-stories-27jan2024.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-933042" /><br/>
This week also saw the public release of iOS 17.3 with several new features, rumors about upcoming hardware, the end of an era for Apple retail, and more, so read on below for all the details!<br/>
<br/>
<h2>iOS 17.4 Introduces Alternative App Marketplaces With No Commission in EU</h2><br/>
Apple this week seeded the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/25/ios-17-4-beta-1/">first developer beta of iOS 17.4</a>, and it comes alongside significant changes, particularly for users in the European Union to comply with the Digital Markets Act that goes into effect in early March.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/ios-17-4-major-app-store-changes.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-933029" /><br/>
Most notably, iOS 17.4 will allow EU users to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/25/ios-17-4-alternative-app-marketplaces-eu/">install apps from marketplaces other than the App Store</a>. Apple will not charge a commission on purchases for these apps, but there will be a per-install Core Technology Fee.<br/>
<br/>
Other changes coming as part of iOS 17.4 include <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/25/apple-allows-game-streaming-apps-on-app-store/">worldwide support for game streaming apps</a>, allowing EU users to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/25/third-party-default-browsers-eu-ios-17-4/">set third-party browsers as default</a>, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/25/apple-nfc-third-party-apps-eu/">opening up the iPhone's NFC capabilities</a> in the European Economic Area to support payments by systems other than Apple Pay and the Wallet app.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Apple Releases iOS 17.3 and iPadOS 17.3 With Stolen Device Protection, Collaborative Apple Music Playlists and More</h2><br/>
The initial beta of iOS 17.4 comes just after the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/22/apple-releases-ios-17-3/">public release of iOS 17.3</a> and related operating system updates this week. <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ios-17-3-features/">iOS 17.3 brings</a> a new Stolen Device Protection feature to help keep your device and accounts secure.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/iOS-17.3-Whats-New-Thumb-1.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-932208" /><br/>
The update also brings <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/use-collaborative-apple-music-playlists/">collaborative Apple Music playlists</a> with emoji reactions, support for using AirPlay to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/17/ios-17-3-airplay-hotel-room-tvs/">stream content directly to select hotel TVs</a>, and more.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>New iPad Air, iPad Pro, and MacBook Air Models Likely to Launch in March or April</h2><br/>
Apple plans to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/21/new-ipads-and-macbook-airs-spring-2024-rumor/">release new iPad Air, iPad Pro, and MacBook Air models in the spring</a> this year, according to <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman. Based on this time frame, the devices could be released as early as this March or April.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/iPad-Air-12.9-Inch-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2192" height="1233" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-917813" /><br/>
The iPad Pro is expected to see a significant redesign including OLED displays, an M3 chip, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/25/ipad-pro-landscape-face-id-camera/">perhaps a landscape Face ID camera system</a>. Meanwhile, the iPad Air is expected to see a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/20/next-gen-ipad-air-with-12-9-inch-display-and-redesigned-camera-unit-revealed-in-cad-renders/">new 12.9-inch option</a> join the existing 10.9-inch size, while the MacBook Air should see largely internal upgrades such as a move to the M3 chip.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Here's What Apple Vision Pro's Huge Box Looks Like</h2><br/>
Apple has yet to officially reveal to the public what the box for the Apple Vision Pro will look like, but <em>MacRumors</em> has seen an internal employee video that offers a glimpse of the packaging and we've <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/22/heres-what-apple-vision-pros-box-looks-like/">created a rendering that approximates the design</a>.<br/>

The box is somewhat larger than might be expected, with the headset, bands, and other various parts all packaged inside a relatively plain white box with a front-on view of the headset on top.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>iPhone 7 Users in U.S. Could Receive Up to &#36;349 Payment From Apple</h2><br/>
Apple last year agreed to pay &#36;35 million to settle a U.S. class action lawsuit alleging that the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus were prone to audio issues due to a defective chip in the devices, and it has <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/21/iphone-7-apple-settlement/">now started notifying eligible customers by email</a>.<br/>
<br/>

You may be eligible for a payment from Apple if you are a U.S. resident who owned an iPhone 7 or iPhone 7 Plus between September 16, 2016 and January 3, 2023, and reported audio issues covered by the settlement to Apple, and/or paid Apple out of pocket to have your iPhone repaired or replaced as a result of the covered audio issues.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Apple's Infinite Loop Store Permanently Closes</h2><br/>
As previously announced, Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/20/two-apple-stores-permanently-close-today/">permanently closed its Infinite Loop and Royal Hawaiian retail stores</a> in the U.S. on January 20. Apple said all employees at both stores would be given the opportunity to remain with the company.<br/>
<br/>

Infinite Loop served as Apple's headquarters in Cupertino, California, from 1993 until 2017, when Apple Park opened nearby. The store on the campus existed in various forms for over 30 years and was located at street level near the entrance to the main office building. In its most recent incarnation, it sold a mix of standard Apple products and unique Apple-branded merchandise, such as shirts, reusable bottles, mugs, and notebooks.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple is believed to be working on a new full-sized <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod/">HomePod</a> that features a touchscreen display for the first time. The device is rumored to launch as soon as the first half of this year, so here's everything we know about it so far.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/Second-Generation-HomePod-With-Top-LCD-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-931490" /><br/>
<em>Bloomberg</em> reporter <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a> was first to suggest in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/22/apple-speakers-with-screens-and-cameras-report/">2021</a> that Apple is working on new HomePods with displays and cameras. The &zwnj;HomePod&zwnj;'s OS is now built upon tvOS, and it appears that the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/22/apple-tvos-homepod-facetime-framework/">groundwork</a> for a &zwnj;HomePod&zwnj; with a screen has been slowly laid in the background for some time.<br/>
<br/>
<h3>Design and Functionality</h3><br/>
The first specific report of Apple's intention to launch a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/10/homepod-with-7-inch-display-to-launch-in-2024/">new HomePod model with a display</a> came from Apple analyst <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/">Ming-Chi Kuo</a> in March 2023. He said the device will feature a 7-inch display supplied by China's Tianma. <br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">More details on HomePod B720<br>Same panel size and same design with HomePod 2. Screen were bit curved, looks great after got assembled.<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/appleinternal?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#appleinternal</a> <a href="https://t.co/z8mYgeI3O2">pic.twitter.com/z8mYgeI3O2</a></p>&mdash; Kosutami (@KosutamiSan) <a href="https://twitter.com/KosutamiSan/status/1739573100604477766?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 26, 2023</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div><br/>
<br/>
In October 2023, the Apple leaker and prototype collector known as "<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/kosutami/">Kosutami</a>" shared information about an upcoming <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/21/images-show-new-homepod-with-screen/">HomePod model with an LCD display</a>. The device will purportedly feature a virtually identical design to the second-generation &zwnj;HomePod&zwnj;, but with a large LCD touch screen at the top instead of the LED array used on all &zwnj;HomePod&zwnj; models to date.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/12/homepod-b720.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-928024" /><br/>
This report was subsequently corroborated by other sources, which added that the model is in active development under the codename "B720". Code in tvOS 17 apparently suggests that <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/">Apple Music</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-podcasts/">Apple Podcasts</a> are among the first apps being rewritten to be compatible with the new display, which will show a blurred animation based on the colors of the album art when a song or podcast is playing. The screen could also potentially show important notifications. <br/>
<br/>
In December, Kosutami <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/27/future-homepod-to-add-curved-lcd-display/">shared further images</a> of the prototype device, showing a curved, convex LCD screen to display content at the top.<br/>
<br/>
<h3>Chip</h3><br/>
There is also the potential for a new chip. The 2023 &zwnj;HomePod&zwnj; contains the S7 chip, the same chip used in 2021's Apple Watch Series 7. Despite the introduction of the S8 chip in late 2022 in the Apple Watch Series 8, Apple Watch Ultra, and second-generation <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch-se/">Apple Watch SE</a>, Apple elected to use the S7 chip.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/08/s9-chip-apple-watch.jpg" alt="" width="1501" height="844" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-913379" /><br/>
Apple's latest Apple Watch models feature the S9 chip, which is significantly more capable than all of its predecessors because it is based on the A15 Bionic. Many <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a> requests are processed locally, meaning that responsiveness could benefit from an improved chip. The S9 could also open the ability for health and fitness-related enquiries, but the exact chip the device will use is unknown.<br/>
<br/>
<h3>Additional Features</h3><br/>
The next-generation ‌&zwnj;HomePod&zwnj;‌'s display could facilitate deeper integration with Apple's other hardware products, Kuo believes. For example, a new &zwnj;HomePod&zwnj; could conceivably introduce a lower-latency Handoff experience with the second-generation Ultra Wideband chip used in the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a>.<br/>
<br/>
It could also tout improved audio hardware and microphones, as well as specification upgrades like Wi-Fi 6E support.<br/>
<br/>
<h3>Release Date</h3><br/>
In his original March 2023 report, Kuo said that the new &zwnj;HomePod&zwnj; would launch in the first half of 2024. There are no concrete rumors about any other new full-sized HomePods at the current time. Meanwhile, Kuo said that Apple will begin mass shipments of the second-generation <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod-mini/">HomePod mini</a> <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/02/03/homepod-mini-2-shipping-next-year/">in the second half of 2024</a>.<br/>
<br/>
It is not clear if the touchscreen &zwnj;HomePod&zwnj; will be a direct replacement for the second-generation &zwnj;HomePod&zwnj; or a new, high-end offering in the lineup, but it may not be long before we know for sure.<br/>
<br/>
In the long term, Apple is believed to be <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/08/apple-engineers-pessimistic-apple-tv-strategy/">rethinking its smart home strategy</a> and is reportedly working on a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/05/28/gurman-combined-homepod-apple-tv-in-development/">combined Apple TV and HomePod device</a>, as well as a &zwnj;HomePod&zwnj; with a screen <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/12/homepod-ipad-with-robotic-arm/">mounted on a robotic arm</a>.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod/">HomePod</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#HomePod">HomePod (Buy Now)</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/27/touchscreen-homepod-everything-we-know/">Apple&#039;s Touchscreen HomePod Coming This Year: Everything We Know</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apples-touchscreen-homepod-coming-this-year-everything-we-know.2417575/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple is sending out push notifications to Apple Savings account holders letting them know about yet another rate increase. The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-card/">Apple Card</a> Savings Account APY is now at 4.50%, up from 4.35%.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-892213" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/04/apple-card-savings-account-16x9.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" /><br/>
This is the third APY rate increase the &zwnj;Apple Card&zwnj; Savings Account has seen since December. The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/20/apple-savings-4-25-interest-rate/">first increase</a> brought it from 4.15% to 4.25%, and the second, which happened <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/04/apple-card-savings-account-apr-increase/">in early January</a>, increased it from 4.25% to 4.35%.<br/>
<br/>
Apple's prior rate increase put it on par with the APY offered by many other popular high-yield savings accounts from American Express and Discover, and with the newest hike, the Apple Savings Account also matches the APY of Marcus by Goldman Sachs.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Apple has once again raised their savings account interest rate from 4.35% to 4.50%! <a href="https://t.co/59dDP502us">pic.twitter.com/59dDP502us</a></p>&mdash; Aaron (@aaronp613) <a href="https://twitter.com/aaronp613/status/1751080572452012510?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 27, 2024</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div><br/>
Apple's high-yield savings account has been available to U.S. &zwnj;Apple Card&zwnj; holders since April 2023, and it is offered in partnership with Goldman Sachs.<br/>
<br/>
&zwnj;Apple Card&zwnj; users are able to earn interest on their automatic Daily Cash deposits and also personal funds that are added to the account.

		<description><![CDATA[When the Vision Pro launches, it will not feature some popular apps like <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/17/netflix-wont-offer-vision-pro-app-at-launch/">Netflix</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/18/youtube-spotify-vision-pro/">YouTube</a>, or Spotify, with users instead relegated to accessing these services through the Safari web browser on the device.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/02/Netflix-Smaller-4.jpg" alt="" width="2250" height="1266" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-884794" /><br/>
In an interview with <em><a href="https://stratechery.com/2024/an-interview-with-netflix-co-ceo-greg-peters-about-strategy-and-execution/">Stratechery</a></em>, Netflix co-CEO Greg Peters explained earlier this week that Netflix does not plan to develop a Vision Pro app at this time because the device is "so subscale" that it is "not really particularly relevant" to most Netflix members.<br/>
<br/>
Peters said that Netflix needs to be careful about how money is spent, ensuring that resources are not invested in areas that will not yield a return.<br/>
<blockquote>You got to a good one really quick there already. Not by any unwillingness or lack of desire to do that, but even when you note we look at as close to ubiquity on devices perspective, the decisions that lead to that are we try and be very rigorous about, "What's the effort to integrate on any given set of devices and what's the benefit for the members that we serve?". We have to be careful about making sure that we're not investing in places that are not really yielding a return, and I would say we'll see where things go with Vision Pro. Certainly we're always in discussions with Apple to try and figure that out but right now, the device is so subscale that it's not really particularly relevant to most of our members.</blockquote><br/>
Peters implied that Netflix is not ruling out a future Vision Pro app. "We've always had active discussions to how we could help each other out," he said about Apple. "Sometimes we find a great space of overlap. We can move very, very quickly. Sometimes it takes a little longer."<br/>
<br/>
The Vision Pro is priced at &#36;3,500, which puts it out of range of many of Apple's customers, and Apple is manufacturing a limited number of the devices in 2024, according to rumors. Apple analyst <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/">Ming-Chi Kuo</a> <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/22/apple-already-sold-up-to-180000-vision-pros/">recently said</a> that Apple sold between 160,000 to 180,000 units when pre-orders launched, and that the company will only ship around 500,000 units for the year.<br/>
<br/>
Despite early demand, Kuo said that the Vision Pro is "still a very niche product," a view that appears to be shared by some notable companies not creating apps for the device.<br/>
<br/>
The Vision Pro is able to run <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> apps with little to no effort from developers, but Netflix has opted not to allow the Netflix &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; app to be available on the headset. Peters did not explain why. Instead, Netflix subscribers will need to watch Netflix through the Vision Pro web browser.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/26/netflix-vision-pro-not-relevant/">Netflix Not Developing App for Vision Pro Because Headset is &#039;Subscale&#039; and &#039;Not Relevant&#039; to Subscribers</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/netflix-not-developing-app-for-vision-pro-because-headset-is-subscale-and-not-relevant-to-subscribers.2417554/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The iOS 17.4 beta that Apple seeded to developers yesterday introduces <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/25/ios-17-4-alternative-app-marketplaces-eu/">major app ecosystem changes</a> in the European Union, but there are also a handful of other features that have been overshadowed. Once such new addition is a transcript option in the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-podcasts/">Apple Podcasts</a> app, which is similar to the lyric feature in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/">Apple Music</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/podcast-app-transcript.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-932875" /><br/>
Recent uploads in the Podcasts app have a new transcript icon, and if tapped, it shows a full transcript of the entire podcast. As with &zwnj;Apple Music&zwnj;, the transcript scrolls as the episode plays.<br/>
<br/>
Transcripts are automatically generated, but appear to be fairly accurate. The transcripts take just a few seconds to generate when a new podcast is played, so they can be useful for determining whether the content in a show is something worth the time to listen to. Searching for a specific word or phrase is supported, and tapping on that word or phrase jumps to that spot in the episode.<br/>
<br/>
Note that not all podcast episodes have transcripts right now, but Apple says that transcripts for back catalog episodes are being added over time. Transcripts are available in English, French, German, and Spanish, and podcast hosts also have the option to upload their own transcripts rather than using the automatically generated version.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[In iOS 17.4, Apple is making a number of changes to iOS to comply with the Digital Markets Act in the European Union. One of these updates will see Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/25/third-party-default-browsers-eu-ios-17-4/">allowing alternate browser engines</a>, with WebKit no longer required for third-party browsers like Firefox and Chrome.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/08/mozilla-firefox-banner-fixed.jpg" alt="" width="1599" height="838" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-811266" /><br/>
While support for alternative browser engines sounds like a win for browser companies, Mozilla spokesperson Damiano DeMonte <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/26/24052067/mozilla-apple-ios-browser-rules-firefox">told <em>The Verge</em></a> that Firefox is "extremely disappointed" with the way Apple is implementing the feature because it <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/26/apple-eu-app-ecosystem-tidbits/">does not extend to the iPad</a>.<blockquote>"We are still reviewing the technical details but are extremely disappointed with Apple's proposed plan to restrict the newly-announced BrowserEngineKit to EU-specific apps. The effect of this would be to force an independent browser like Firefox to build and maintain two separate browser implementations -- a burden Apple themselves will not have to bear."</blockquote>Firefox uses the Gecko engine and could swap to that on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>, but it would need to continue using WebKit on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>. According to DeMonte, Apple's implementation of the DMA does not give consumers "viable choices" because it makes it "as painful as possible" for companies to provide alternatives to Safari.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/26/mozilla-on-apple-eu-browser-engine-change/">Mozilla is &#039;Extremely Disappointed&#039; With Implementation of Apple&#039;s EU Browser Engine Change</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/mozilla-is-extremely-disappointed-with-implementation-of-apples-eu-browser-engine-change.2417540/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Spotify CEO Daniel EK <a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2024-01-26/apples-proposed-changes-reject-the-goals-of-the-dma/">today wrote a blog post</a> criticizing the app ecosystem changes that Apple implemented in the European Union under the Digital Markets Act, accusing Apple of putting forward "a new plan that is a complete and total farce" under "the false pretense of compliance and concessions."<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/08/General-Spotify-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1407" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-810756" /><br/>
Ek says that Apple doesn't "think the rules apply to them," and he believes that most app developers are not going to be able to adopt Apple's new terms.<br/>
<br/>
The 0.50 euro Core Technology Fee collected per install per year (after 1 million installs) is "extortion," according to Ek. Combined with the reduced commission through the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a> (10-20% depending on options selected), Ek claims that developers of popular apps will pay "the same or even more to Apple" than with the prior rules.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">After sitting with our legal team to parse through the fine print of Apple&#39;s DMA announcement (that took a while), which is, at best vague and misleading, I wanted to share my thoughts.  <br><br>While Apple has behaved badly for years, what they did yesterday represents a new low, even…</p>&mdash; Daniel Ek (@eldsjal) <a href="https://twitter.com/eldsjal/status/1750988499518362089?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 26, 2024</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div><br/>
According to Ek, Spotify is facing "an untenable situation." With Apple's new terms, Spotify would have to pay 0.50 euros per user along with a 17 percent commission, which is the same or worse as under the old rules. Ek claims that an alternative app store offering could potentially increase customer acquisition costs tenfold because of the need to pay the fee even for non-subscribers.<blockquote>And if we managed to remove our app from the App Store and only existed in the Alternative App Store, that would still not work. With our EU Apple install base in the 100 million user range, this new tax on downloads and updates could skyrocket our customer acquisition costs, potentially increasing them tenfold. This, as we have to pay on every install or update to our free or paid app, even for those who no longer use the service.</blockquote>Ek concludes that Apple is "forcing developers to stay with the status quo," which "negates the goal of the DMA." The future that Spotify <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/24/spotify-shares-vision-iap-eu-regulation/">outlined earlier this week</a> promising a better experience for users in the EU is "less clear," according to Ek, and he calls on European Commissioners to reject Apple's "blatant disregard" of the DMA.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/epic-games/">Epic Games</a> CEO Tim Sweeney, another outspoken Apple critic, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/25/fortnite-returning-to-ios-in-europe/">shared similar thoughts yesterday</a>. He said that the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; changes are a "devious new instance of malicious compliance" aimed at thwarting the Digital Markets Act.<br/>
<br/>
Sweeney said that while Fortnite will return to iOS through a planned &zwnj;Epic Games&zwnj; app marketplace on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>, Epic will continue to "argue to the courts and regulators that Apple is breaking the law."<br/>
<br/>
In a statement to <em>MacRumors</em>, Apple said that it is happy to support the success of all developers, and that under the new business terms, more than 99 percent of developers will pay the same amount or less to Apple.<blockquote>We’re happy to support the success of all developers — including Spotify, which has the most successful music streaming app in the world. The changes we’re sharing for apps in the European Union give developers choice — with new options to distribute iOS apps and process payments. Every developer can choose to stay on the same terms in place today. And under the new terms, more than 99% of developers would pay the same or less to Apple.</blockquote><div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/spotify/">Spotify</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/european-union/">European Union</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/26/spotify-on-apple-eu-app-changes/">Spotify CEO Daniel Ek on Apple&#039;s EU Changes: &#039;They Think the Rules Don&#039;t Apply to Them&#039;</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/spotify-ceo-daniel-ek-on-apples-eu-changes-they-think-the-rules-dont-apply-to-them.2417538/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple announced an overwhelming number of changes <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/25/ios-17-4-alternative-app-marketplaces-eu/">to the app ecosystem</a> in the European Union yesterday, and with the flood of information, there may have been a few details that were overlooked by developers and device users.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/App-Store-vs-EU-Feature-2.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-932826" /><br/>
We've rounded up a handful of lesser-known details that offer some clarification on what these updates mean for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> and other products.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>The iPad and Other Devices</h2><br/>
The Digital Markets Act required Apple to make changes to both "iOS" and to the "<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a>," with the European Commission defining iOS as the operating system that runs on the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;, and the "&zwnj;App Store&zwnj;" as a cross-platform entity that operates on all of Apple's operating systems.<br/>
<br/>
For that reason, some of the changes that Apple is making are exclusive to the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;, while others are coming to iOS, iPadOS, macOS, tvOS, and watchOS.<br/>
<h3>Limited to the iPhone</h3><br/>
<ul><br/>
 	<li><strong>Alternative app marketplaces</strong> - Alternative app marketplaces will only be available on the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;, not the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>, so there will not be an option to install a third-party app store on an &zwnj;iPad&zwnj;. There will also be no way to install an app from an alternative app store on an &zwnj;iPad&zwnj;. Alternative marketplace apps will be &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; only.</li><br/>
 	<li><strong>App notarization</strong> - Notarization is linked to alternative app marketplaces and will apply to iOS apps, not iPadOS apps.</li><br/>
 	<li><strong>Alternative browser engines</strong> - Allowing browsers to use an alternative engine is a feature that is also &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; only. Chrome, for example, would only be able to use a non-WebKit engine for its Chrome for &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; app, not the Chrome for &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; app.</li><br/>
 	<li><strong>NFC access</strong> - Banking and wallet apps on &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; can access NFC technology and users can set alternative contactless payment apps as default.</li><br/>
</ul><br/>
<h2>App Store Changes for iOS, iPadOS, macOS, watchOS, and tvOS</h2><br/>
<ul><br/>
 	<li><strong>Apple's new business terms</strong> - The new business terms, which come with a Core Technology Fee and reduced &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; commissions, are applicable to all platforms.</li><br/>
 	<li><strong>Third-party payments</strong> - Developers can opt out of In-App Purchases, instead using a third-party payment service provider for digital goods and services.</li><br/>
 	<li><strong>App Store labels</strong> - When an app uses alternative payment processing, it will say so on the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; product page and on an in-app disclosure sheet that warns customers that a developer is directing them to transact with an alternative payment processor.</li><br/>
 	<li><strong>Payment link-outs</strong> - Developers can include a link to allow users to complete a transaction on the developer's website, and can also let users know about promotions, discounts, and deals available outside of their apps.</li><br/>
</ul><br/>
<br/>
<h2>Default App Marketplaces</h2><br/>
&zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; users in Europe can choose to set an alternative app marketplace as the default on their device as required under the DMA. This feature doesn't do much other than show results from the alternative app marketplace in Spotlight search when the search contains something that is available in that marketplace.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>App Marketplace Requirements</h2><br/>
App marketplaces need to provide Apple with proof of solvency in the form of a &#36;1m euro letter of credit. While apps installed through marketplaces do not have to pay a 0.50 euro Core Technology Fee for the first 1 million "first installs" of an app, that does not apply to app marketplaces. The fee has to be paid right away.<br/>
<br/>
Developers who want to create an app marketplace need to have a presence in the European Union.<br/>
<br/>
App marketplaces only have to pay the Core Technology Fee for app marketplace installs. The fee for individual apps will be paid by those apps, not by the marketplace that they're on.<br/>
<br/>
An app marketplace may not have just a single app in it, because there is a requirement that marketplaces be fair to developers. Marketplaces can set requirements, such as all games or all educational apps, but all apps in that category must be able to apply to be a part of that marketplace.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>App Marketplace Installation</h2><br/>
An app marketplace will be able to be installed as an app through Safari or another web browser, from the app marketplace's developer.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>App Marketplace Limitations and Features</h2><br/>
Marketplace apps are compatible with core iOS features. They will show up in Spotlight, can work with most Screen Time features, and are included in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/icloud/">iCloud</a> backups.<br/>
<br/>
Screen Time purchase restrictions will not be available for app marketplace apps, nor will Family Purchase Sharing or universal purchase.<br/>
<br/>
Apple will not market alternative app stores, or present them as options to users. Developers will need to create their own audience for their marketplaces. Apple also will have no say in refunds or subscription management tools, as the user must go to the marketplace for these options.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Managing Alternative Marketplace Apps</h2><br/>
If an alternative marketplace app is deleted from an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;, the apps that were installed through that marketplace won't be able to be updated until the marketplace is reinstalled.<br/>
<br/>
Users will be able to see which marketplace an app was downloaded from in the Settings app.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Adopting Apple's New Business Terms</h2><br/>
Developers who opt in to Apple's new business terms, including the Core Technology Fee and reduced commissions, cannot go back to the prior system. It is a one-time change.<br/>
<br/>
Agreeing to the new business terms is done on a per-account level, not per-app.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Notarization and Review</h2><br/>
While Notarization will scan for malware, viruses, and ensure that an app does what it says it does, Apple will have less control over content. Copyright violations, IP theft, and other violations will need to be reported to individual app marketplaces, not to Apple.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>TestFlight</h2><br/>
Developers can use TestFlight to test an app that is being developed for an alternative marketplace, even if that app will not be distributed through the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>NFC</h2><br/>
The NFC changes apply to countries in the European Economic Area, not just EU countries. The European Economic Area also includes Iceland, Liechtenstein, and Norway, countries that are not in the European Union.<br/>
<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[For this week's giveaway, we've teamed up with <a href="https://www.lululook.com/">Lululook</a> to offer <em>MacRumors</em> readers a chance to win a 45mm <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch/">Apple Watch Series 9</a> and one of <a href="https://www.lululook.com/collections/apple-watch-bands">Lululook's Apple Watch bands</a> to go along with it.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/lululook-sport-orange.jpg" alt="" width="1295" height="728" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-933157" /><br/>
Lululook makes a <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fs%3Fk%3Dlululook%26amp%3Bref%3Dnb_sb_noss">range of accessories</a> for Apple devices, including multiple Apple Watch bands that work with all of the available Apple Watch models. For those who are looking for a more stylish alternative to Apple's Sport Band, Lululook has <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FLULULOOK-iWatch-Original-Wristband-Replacement%2Fdp%2FB0CQY562ZJ%3F">the FKM Sport Band</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/lululook-fkm-bands.jpg" alt="" width="970" height="497" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-933163" /><br/>
Priced at &#36;50, the FMK Sport Band is made from a soft silicone material that's water and sweat resistant. It has a matte finish for a soft, plush feel that makes it comfortable to wear all day, and Lululook says that the design is breathable, lightweight, and irritation-free.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/lululook-sport-band-blue.jpg" alt="" width="1273" height="716" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-933158" /><br/>
Compared to other silicone bands on the market, the FMK band is made from a denser material that gives it more pliability, and the wave design is meant to give it a unique look that transitions from workouts to the office. The band uses a pin-and-tuck closure that ensures it remains secured on the wrist. Lululook offers this band in multiple fun colors, including forest green, bright yellow, gray, black, blue, orange, and glow-in-the-dark.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/lululook-silicone-band-green.jpg" alt="" width="853" height="583" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-933164" /><br/>
For those who prefer metal bands, Lululook has quite a few options. The <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FLULULOOK-Compatible-Stainless-Magnetic-iWatch%2Fdp%2FB0CL68P27B%2F%3Fth%3D1">&#36;25 Modern Milanese Loop</a> is an alternative to Apple's own Milanese band, and it is made from a mesh stainless steel with a wrap design. It comes in several colors, including black, silver, gold, rose gold, and starlight. The band is designed to be thin, cutting down on weight and making it comfortable to wear.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/lululook-milanese-modern.jpg" alt="" width="1308" height="736" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-933159" /><br/>
The &#36;24 <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FLULULOOK-Compatible-Stainless-Magnetic-iWatch%2Fdp%2FB0CKYJZ5B9%2F">Retro Milanese Loop</a> is similar to the Modern version, but it has a more classic watch design. This model is limited to black and silver, but it has the same lightweight build and magnetic wrap closure for easy removal.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/lululook-milanese-retro.jpg" alt="" width="1313" height="739" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-933160" /><br/>
The &#36;35 <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FLULULOOK-Needed-Compatible-Stainless-Ultra2%2Fdp%2FB0CL68KRZM%2F%3Fth%3D1">Stainless Steel Band</a> is an alternative to Apple's expensive Link Bracelet. There are four to five removable links on each side depending on the size of the band, which allows it to be quickly adjusted to an appropriate size. Links can be removed by hand without a tool, and there's a simple but secure magnetic buckle that keeps it on the wrist.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/lululook-link-band.jpg" alt="" width="1309" height="736" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-933161" /><br/>
All of Lululook's bands work with any modern Apple Watch model, and Lululook often has deals so it's worth checking in every now and then if you're in need of a new watch band.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Starting with <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/25/ios-17-4-beta-1/">iOS 17.4</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/25/tvos-17-4-beta-1/">tvOS 17.4</a>, currently in beta, Apple has expanded SharePlay music control to HomePod speakers and the Apple TV. The feature was tipped to us by <a href="https://twitter.com/hiddecollee7">Hidde Collee</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/aaronp613">Aaron Perris</a>, and Benjamin Xing.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/SharePlay-Music-Control-Expanding-Feature-2.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-933114" /><br/>
This feature allows family and friends to control the music that is playing on your HomePod or Apple TV with permission. For now, this is limited to the Music app, but the other people do not need to have an Apple Music subscription in order to participate.<br/>
<br/>
Apple already rolled out a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/06/13/whats-new-carplay-ios-17/">similar feature for CarPlay</a> last year, allowing anyone in a car to control music playback via SharePlay with permission.<br/>
<br/>
The primary user can decide whether to approve or deny each request.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>HomePod</h2><br/>
While playing a song in the Music app on your iPhone, tap the SharePlay icon at the bottom of the screen to bring up a QR code, which another person can scan with their iPhone or Android smartphone's camera to request access to music playback controls. Even a screenshot of the QR code suffices, allowing you to remotely grant access to people around the world if so desired.<br/>
<br/>
The feature works on both the HomePod and HomePod mini, and we could imagine the QR code eventually being shown on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/20/homepod-with-screen-delayed-next-year/">long-rumored HomePod with a screen</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Apple TV</h2><br/>
With the tvOS 17.4 update, the Music app on the Apple TV can also show a QR code on the TV that guests can scan to request access to music controls.<br/>
<br/>
The expansion of this feature to the Apple TV and the HomePod is useful for house parties, allowing everyone to be the DJ.<br/>
<br/>
The first beta versions of iOS 17.4, tvOS 17.4, and HomePod software version 17.4 were made available to developers on Thursday for testing. Apple said iOS 17.4 will be released in March, so we can expect the other updates to launch then too.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod/">HomePod</a></div><div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/">Apple Music</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/shareplay/">SharePlay</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_TV">Apple TV (Neutral)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#HomePod">HomePod (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-tv-and-home-theater.100">Apple TV and Home Theater</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/26/shareplay-music-control-homepod-apple-tv/">SharePlay Music Control Expanding to HomePod and Apple TV</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/shareplay-music-control-expanding-to-homepod-and-apple-tv.2417520/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[On this week's episode of <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/podcast/the-macs-40th-birthday-and-apple-car-scaled-back-again/id1602394741?i=1000643090315">The MacRumors Show</a>, we discuss the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/23/apple-macintosh-turns-40/">40th anniversary of the Macintosh</a>, some of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/17/netflix-wont-offer-vision-pro-app-at-launch/">latest controversy</a> surrounding apps for the Vision Pro headset, and the news of Apple's vehicle project yet again being <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/23/apple-car-scaled-down-2028-launch/">scaled back</a>.<br/>

The original Macintosh, unveiled by Steve Jobs, was a game-changer with its graphical user interface and the introduction of the mouse. We explore how the Macintosh's ease of use and innovative design principles, such as a desktop with icons and the ability to use multiple programs in windows, revolutionized personal computing. Reflecting on the Mac's journey, we delve into the evolution of macOS and its remarkable consistency over the years, and point out some of our personal experiences with the platform.<br/>
<br/>
Shifting gears, we discuss the imminent launch of Apple's Vision Pro headset, examining some of the potential challenges it may face and the reasons behind the absence of certain streaming apps like Netflix. We ponder whether this absence is due to genuine technical hurdles or strategic decisions by these companies.<br/>
<br/>
We then turn to the latest updates and challenges surrounding Apple's electric vehicle project, looking at how the company has reportedly pivoted from its initial ambition for a driverless car to developing a vehicle with more conventional and basic driver-assistance features. As we wrap up, we dive into the broader context of electric vehicles, discussing our wish for Apple's car to offer a fresh perspective, moving beyond Tesla's design approach to introduce more variety to the market.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[This week's deals encompassed a wide array of products, from the all-time lows on the AirPods Pro 2 with USB-C and M2 Mac mini, to steep pre-order discounts on the Samsung Galaxy S24 smartphones.<br/>
<br/>

<h2>AirPods Pro</h2><br/>

<br/>
The AirPods Pro 2 with USB-C have been the centerpiece of Apple deals in January, and Amazon continues to offer them for the all-time low price of &#36;189.00, down from &#36;249.00. If you pre-ordered the Apple Vision Pro last week, this version of the AirPods Pro 2 will add lossless audio to the headset.<br/>

<br/>
Best Buy is offering up to &#36;870 off the S24 series with trade-in and pre-order, with a storage upgrade and up to a &#36;150 Best Buy gift card. Best Buy is also offering up to &#36;120 off the S24 series even without a trade-in, so if you just want a brand new unlocked model of the Samsung smartphones, this will be one of the best deals.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[After updating to iOS 17.4, which is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/25/ios-17-4-beta-1/">currently in beta</a>, iPhone users in the EU will be <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/25/third-party-default-browsers-eu-ios-17-4/">prompted to choose a default web browser</a> when they first open Safari. In an email today, Apple shared additional details about how this process will work.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/Apple-EU-iOS-Changes.jpg" alt="" width="1312" height="738" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-933094" /><br/>
Apple said iPhone users in the EU will be presented with a list of the 12 most popular web browsers from their country's local App Store at the time, and noted that the options will be shown in random order for every user.<br/>
<br/>
Apple shared an alphabetical list of the browsers that will currently be shown in every EU country. It is a very long list, so we have elected to highlight browsers that will be shown in France, Germany, Italy, and Spain as examples.<ul><li><strong>France:</strong> Aloha, Brave, Chrome, DuckDuckGo, Ecosia, Edge, Firefox, Onion Browser, Opera, Private Browser Deluxe, Qwant, and Safari</li><br/>
<li><strong>Germany:</strong> Aloha, Brave, Chrome, DuckDuckGo, Ecosia, Edge, Firefox, Ivanti Web@Work, Onion Browser, Opera, Safari, and You.com AI Search Assistant</li><br/>
<li><strong>Italy:</strong> Aloha, Brave, Chrome, DuckDuckGo, Ecosia, Edge, Firefox, Ivanti Web@Work, Onion Browser, Opera, Safari, and You.com AI Search Assistant</li><br/>
<li><strong>Spain:</strong> Aloha, Brave, Chrome, DuckDuckGo, Ecosia, Edge, Firefox, Onion Browser, Opera, Safari, Vivaldi, and You.com AI Search Assistant</li></ul>There are <a href="https://european-union.europa.eu/principles-countries-history/country-profiles_en">23 other countries in the EU</a> that this change applies to. Notably, this no longer includes the UK, which withdrew from the EU in 2020.<br/>
<br/>
It has already been possible to change an iPhone's default web browser through the Settings app since iOS 14. Apple has now gone a step further and added the default browser prompt in Safari to comply with new regulations under the EU's Digital Markets Act.<br/>
<br/>
In the EU, iOS 17.4 also allows web browsers to use web engines other than Apple's WebKit.<br/>
<br/>
Apple said iOS 17.4 will be released to the public in March.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-17/">iPadOS 17</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-17.241">iOS 17</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-17.242">iPadOS 17</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/26/apple-explains-ios-17-4-default-browsers-eu/">Apple Further Explains iOS 17.4&#039;s New Default Browser Prompt in EU</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-further-explains-ios-17-4s-new-default-browser-prompt-in-eu.2417507/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple on Thursday seeded the first betas of upcoming iOS 17.4 and iPadOS 17.4 software updates to developers, and the betas revealed a panoply of changes that will impact users in the European Union in order to comply with the Digital Markets Act (DMA).<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/App-Store-vs-EU-Feature-2.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-932826" /><br/>
Apple implemented several major changes to the way the App Store and apps operate in the EU in order to comply with the DMA. These changes are included in iOS 17.4, but are generally limited to countries that are in the European Union.<br/>
<br/>
Apple is working towards a March 6 deadline to make the changes live for users who update to iOS 17.4. Below, we've summarized what will change for affected users and the reasons that Apple has offered for said changes, along with some related news.<br/>
<br/>
<ul><li><strong>Alternative App Stores</strong>: App developers in the EU can opt to offer alternative app stores or install their apps <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/25/ios-17-4-alternative-app-marketplaces-eu/">through alternative stores</a>, and Apple has a new fee structure as part of the change. Any developer can create an app marketplace, so long as they meet Apple's criteria for customer experience, fraud prevention, customer support, and more.</li><br/>
<li><strong>Alternative Payment Options</strong>: Apple is allowing apps to use <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/25/ios-17-4-alternative-app-marketplaces-eu/">alternative payment options</a>, and there is no longer a requirement to use in-app purchases. Developers can integrate these into their app, or developers can link out to their websites where users can make a purchase.</li><br/>
<li><strong>App Store Notarization</strong>: Apple has outlined how Apps that are distributed through alternative app stores in EU countries will need to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/25/alternative-app-store-notarization-process/">submit to a notarization process</a> that's similar to the notarization process for Mac apps. </li><br/>
<li><strong>Screen Time and Refund Limitations:</strong>: Apple says apps distributed through alternative app stores <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/25/features-unavailable-with-alternative-app-stores/">won't work with some long-standing features</a> like Screen Time, refunds, and in-app purchases, as they do for standard App Store apps.</li><br/>
<li><strong>NFC Third-Party Access</strong>: NFC payments will be available directly in apps <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/25/apple-nfc-third-party-apps-eu/">without the need for Apple Pay or the Wallet app</a>, allowing third-party payment services and banks to offer their own tap-to-pay solutions on Apple devices in the European Economic Area.</li><br/>
<li><strong>Default Browser Options</strong>: Users in the EU will be allowed to choose a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/25/third-party-default-browsers-eu-ios-17-4/">new default browser</a> from a list of the most downloaded browsers on iOS devices. Some of the options include Firefox, Opera, Chrome, Brave, and Microsoft Edge.</li><br/>
<li><strong>Hardware and Software Developer Access</strong>: Apple will allows developers of iOS apps distributed in the EU to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/25/apple-interoperability-request-form/">request additional interoperability</a> with iPhone hardware and software features. Apple says it will evaluate interoperability requests on a case-by-case basis.</li><br/>
<li><strong>Expanded Analytics Availability</strong>: As part of the App Store changes in the EU, Apple is providing all developers worldwide with <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/25/apple-developer-analytics-expansion/">updated analytics information</a>. More than 50 new reports will be available through the App Store Connect API to help developers analyze their app performance.<br/>
<li><strong>Apple's Reasons for Limiting Changes to EU</strong>: In a support document, Apple has <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/25/alternative-app-store-eu-risks/">explained</a> why alternative app stores, alternative payment options, and other updates are being limited to the EU, highlighting risks like fraud, scams, and other privacy threats.</li></ul>As a direct or indirect consequence of the announced changes coming in iOS 17.4, there have also been some other significant developments overnight. <br/>
<br/>
Apple's new EU terms include a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/25/apple-eu-fees-could-bankrupt-app-developers/">Core Technology Fee</a> that some developers have warned could completely bankrupt freemium apps that go viral by charging them astronomical fees. Apple does not charge for the first one million "first annual installs" per iOS account each year, but after that, developers will begin racking up charges. Apple's Core Technology Fee could also be prohibitively expensive for apps like Spotify that have millions of users.<br/>
<br/>
Epic Games says it <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/25/fortnite-returning-to-ios-in-europe/">plans to bring its Epic Games Store to the iPhone and the iPad</a> under Apple's new alternative app store policy in the EU. The Epic Games Store will include popular game Fortnite, which means iPhone and iPad users will be able to install and play the title without having to use a cloud gaming service. Fortnite has been banned from the iOS App Store for the last several years due to the legal dispute between Apple and Epic Games.<br/>
<br/>
Apple has also <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/25/apple-allows-game-streaming-apps-on-app-store/">announced</a> that it will allow streaming game apps on the App Store worldwide. This will mean services like Xbox Cloud Gaming and Nvidia GeForce NOW will be available as standalone iPhone and iPad apps, whereas previously they were only accessible via the web.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BAzqrT_hZwA?si=oMxgS8QR78TTEEhW" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><br/>
Technology companies need to adhere to the EU's DMA regulations by March 6, 2024. iOS 17.4 is currently available as a beta update, and it is set to see a public release in March. Given Apple's concerns over user privacy and security, the company is unlikely to implement similar changes worldwide without being forced to by similar legislation from other countries.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/european-union/">European Union</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/26/iphone-changes-coming-to-eu-users/">Here Are All the iPhone Changes Coming to EU Users by March 6</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/here-are-all-the-iphone-changes-coming-to-eu-users-by-march-6.2417492/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple this week <a href="https://www.apple.com/ios/carplay/">updated its website</a> to confirm that the first U.S. vehicle models with next-generation CarPlay support will debut in 2024, but it did not provide a more specific timeframe, or indicate when availability will begin in other countries.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/12/Next-Generation-CarPlay-Porsche-1.png" alt="" width="1200" height="675" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-927534" /><br/>
In a next-generation CarPlay section of its website, Apple replaced "Vehicle announcements coming in late 2023" with "First models arrive in 2024."<br/>
<br/>
The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/25/ios-17-4-beta-1/">first beta of iOS 17.4</a> released today references eight new CarPlay apps, as discovered by <em>MacRumors</em> contributors <a href="https://twitter.com/aaronp613/status/1750666693251051812">Aaron Perris</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/stevemoser">Steve Moser</a>:<ul><li><strong>Auto Settings:</strong> This app will let you manage paired iPhones and adjust vehicle settings.</li><br/>
<li><strong>Car Camera:</strong> This app will display the vehicle's rear-view camera feed.</li><br/>
<li><strong>Charge:</strong> For electric vehicles, this app will display battery level, charging status, time remaining until the battery is fully charged, and more.</li><br/>
<li><strong>Climate:</strong> This app will provide access to a vehicle's climate controls within CarPlay, allowing you to adjust the temperature of the A/C or heating system, fan speed, heated seats, heated steering wheel, and more.</li><br/>
<li><strong>Closures:</strong> This app will display if any of the vehicle's doors are opened, and it might also display vehicle warning symbols.</li><br/>
<li><strong>Media:</strong> This app will provide access to FM and AM radio station controls within CarPlay, along with other media options like SiriusXM. It is unclear if SiriusXM will offer satellite connectivity, or remain limited to internet streaming. Users will be able to select from a list of music genres, such as Top 40 and Rock.</li><br/>
<li><strong>Tire Pressure:</strong> This app will display air pressure for each of the vehicle's tires, and provide low pressure, high pressure, and flat tire warnings.</li><br/>
<li><strong>Trips:</strong> This app will provide a variety of driving-related data, including the vehicle's average speed, fuel efficiency or energy efficiency, the total time elapsed and distance traveled on a trip, and more.</li></ul>An image uncovered in the iOS 17.4 beta reveals that next-generation CarPlay will likely display a "Goodbye" screen after the driver shuts off the vehicle:<br/>

As previously announced by Apple, additional images in the iOS 17.4 beta confirm that users will be able to adjust the theme and color scheme of next-generation CarPlay, including the appearance of the instrument cluster:<br/>

Apple first previewed next-generation CarPlay in June 2022. The interface can be tailored to a specific vehicle model and automaker's brand identity, as <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/20/first-next-generation-carplay-vehicles-announced/">previewed by Aston Martin and Porsche</a> in late December. Aston Martin said it would release its first vehicles with next-generation CarPlay in 2024, including a new model of its high-end DB12 sports car. Porsche did not provide a timeframe or specific details about its own plans.<br/>

When first announcing next-generation CarPlay, Apple said committed automakers included Acura, Audi, Ford, Honda, Infiniti, Jaguar, Land Rover, Lincoln, Mercedes-Benz, Nissan, Polestar, Porsche, Renault, and Volvo. Beyond the addition of Aston Martin, it is unclear if this list has changed since that initial announcement.<br/>
<br/>
Apple has not indicated if any next-generation CarPlay features will be made available in existing vehicles with classic CarPlay support. Apple said iOS 17.4 will be released in March, so perhaps additional details will be shared around then.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/carplay/">CarPlay</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-17/">iPadOS 17</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/homepod-homekit-carplay-home-auto-technology.193">HomePod, HomeKit, CarPlay, Home & Auto Technology</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-17.241">iOS 17</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-17.242">iPadOS 17</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/25/ios-17-4-next-generation-carplay/">Apple Confirms Next-Generation CarPlay Launching in 2024, Reveals New Features in iOS 17.4 Beta</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-confirms-next-generation-carplay-launching-in-2024-reveals-new-features-in-ios-17-4-beta.2417478/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today introduced the first betas of iOS 17.4 and iPadOS 17.4 to developers, bringing some radical updates to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> in Europe. Most of the big changes will only impact EU users, but there are also updates in the operating system that are available worldwide.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/iOS-17.4-Feature-Blue.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-932462" /><br/>
In this article, we've rounded up everything new in iOS 17.4 beta 1. <br/>
<br/>
<h2>EU Changes</h2><br/>
Apple implemented several major changes to the way the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a> and apps operate in the European Union in order to comply with the Digital Markets Act. These changes are included in iOS 17.4, but are generally limited to countries that are in the European Union.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/01/iOS-App-Store-General-Feature-Black.jpg" alt="" width="2250" height="1266" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-833990" /><br/>
<h3>Alternative App Stores and New App Store Terms</h3><br/>
App developers in the EU can opt to offer alternative app stores or install their apps through alternative stores, and Apple has a whole new fee structure that goes along with this change. There's a new business structure that developers can opt in to, which applies to both apps distributed in the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; and apps that are distributed through alternative means.<br/>
<br/>
App developers using the new system will need to pay a standard fee of 0.50 euros per user per year, with the first million installs offered for free. Apps distributed through alternative app stores will have no commission. Apps distributed through the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; will pay a reduced 17 percent commission, or 10 percent for those in the small business program or for user subscriptions older than a year.<br/>
<br/>
Developers can choose not to opt in to the new system and can use the existing system with the same 15/30 percent commission that's available elsewhere in the world. Apple has a fee calculator to help developers determine what they'll pay with the existing setup, with the new setup, with the new setup using alternative app stores, and with the new setup using the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
Users are able to set their preferred alternative app store as the default app store on their device if desired. EU users will see an option for this in the Settings app.<br/>
<br/>
There are a huge number of behind-the-scene changes that are enabling this feature in the EU, with updates to all kinds of system messaging. Users in the EU will, for example, get a pop up warning when an app from an alternative app store contains malware, and there are new screens for verifying the information from an alternative app.<br/>
<br/>
A Screen Time setting will allow parents to decide whether their children's devices are able to install apps from alternative app marketplaces.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Alternative Payment Options</h2><br/>
Apple is also allowing apps to use alternative payment options in their apps, and there is no longer a requirement to use in-app purchase. Developers who distribute apps through the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; and use an alternative payment option will see a three percent discount in their &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; fees.<br/>
<br/>
Developers who distribute through alternative apps and also use an alternative payment option will pay Apple no fees beyond the set 0.50 euro fee per user.<br/>
<br/>
With alternative payments, purchases for digital goods and services can be made directly in an app or a developer can choose to link to their website to have a user make a payment. Apple is requiring developers to use a known, secure payment provider.<br/>
<br/>
<h3>Third-Party Browser Updates</h3><br/>
After updating to iOS 17.4, EU users that open Safari will see a pop up that allows them to choose a new default browser option from a list of the most popular browsers on iOS.<br/>
<br/>
Apple is also allowing alternative browser engines, and will not limit browsers like Chrome to the WebKit engine.<br/>
<br/>
<h3>NFC Access</h3><br/>
Third-party payment apps and banks have access to the NFC chip in the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; in iOS 17.4, and can offer contactless payments directly on the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; without using <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-pay/">Apple Pay</a> or the Wallet app in the European Economic Area. Users can set a default contactless payment provider that activates at tap-to-pay terminals or when the Side button on the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; is pressed twice.<br/>
<br/>
The option for setting a default contactless payment provider is available in the Settings app in the EU, and this section will also provide details on all apps that have requested and been granted contactless payment access.<br/>
<br/>
EU users can also change the default Wallet app on the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Gaming App Changes</h2><br/>
Streaming game apps are now allowed on the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; worldwide, which means services like Xbox Cloud Gaming and Nvidia GeForce NOW can be offered as standalone &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; apps.<br/>
<br/>
Apple previously only allowed cloud gaming services to be offered via the web, but dedicated apps that let users stream games from servers are now permitted.<br/>
<br/>
Mini-app, mini-games, chatbots, and plug-ins are also now able to use the in-app purchase system.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>New Emoji</h2><br/>
The iOS 17.4 beta adds new emoji characters that include lime, an edible brown mushroom, a phoenix, a broken chain, shaking head vertically (as in a "yes" nod), and shaking head horizontally (a "no" head shake).<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/iOS-17.4-New-Emoji-Feature-2.5.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1077" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-932812" /><br/>
These emoji are part of the Unicode 15.1 update that was <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/19/ios-17-future-emoji/">approved in September 2023</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Messaging with Siri</h2><br/>
The Automatically Send Messages setting under <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a> & Search has been renamed "Messaging with &zwnj;Siri&zwnj;," and there is an option to set &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; to read incoming messages in a specific language like Spanish, French, German, Chinese, and many more.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/ios-17-4-messaging-with-siri.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-932819" /><br/>
The change does not update the primary language that &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; listens in and responds to, but is limited to message playback.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Podcasts and Music</h2><br/>
The "Listen Now" tabs in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/">Apple Music</a> and Podcasts have been renamed to "Home."<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/apple-music-home.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-932818" /><br/>
<br/>
<h2>Podcast Transcripts</h2><br/>
The Podcasts app now offers transcripts, similar to how lyrics work in the &zwnj;Apple Music&zwnj; app. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/podcast-app-transcript.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-932875" /><br/>
<h2>Safari</h2><br/>
The URL/search bar in Safari is now wider than it was before.<br/>
<br/>

<h2>Stolen Device Protection</h2><br/>
In the Stolen Device Protection section of the Settings app, there is now an option to require a security delay always or only when away from familiar locations. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/ios-17-4-stolen-device-protection.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-932874" /><br/>
<br/>
<h2>Next-Generation CarPlay</h2><br/>
Next-generation <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/carplay/">CarPlay</a> is set to launch in the U.S. later in 2024, and code in iOS 17.4 references eight new &zwnj;CarPlay&zwnj; apps. <br/>
<br/>
<li><strong>Car Camera:</strong> This app will display the vehicle's rear-view camera feed.</li><br/>
<li><strong>Charge:</strong> For electric vehicles, this app will display battery level, charging status, time remaining until the battery is fully charged, and more.</li><br/>
<li><strong>Climate:</strong> This app will provide access to a vehicle's climate controls within &zwnj;CarPlay&zwnj;, allowing you to adjust the temperature of the A/C or heating system, fan speed, heated seats, heated steering wheel, and more.</li><br/>
<li><strong>Closures:</strong> This app will display if any of the vehicle's doors are opened, and it might also display vehicle warning symbols.</li><br/>
<li><strong>Media:</strong> This app will provide access to FM and AM radio station controls within &zwnj;CarPlay&zwnj;, along with other media options like SiriusXM. It is unclear if SiriusXM will offer satellite connectivity, or remain limited to internet streaming. Users will be able to select from a list of music genres, such as Top 40 and Rock.</li><br/>
<li><strong>Tire Pressure:</strong> This app will display air pressure for each of the vehicle's tires, and provide low pressure, high pressure, and flat tire warnings.</li><br/>
<li><strong>Trips:</strong> This app will provide a variety of driving-related data, including the vehicle's average speed, fuel efficiency or energy efficiency, the total time elapsed and distance traveled on a trip, and more.</li></ul>An image in iOS 17.4 beta suggests that &zwnj;CarPlay&zwnj; will also likely display a "Goodbye" screen after the driver shuts off the vehicle.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<h2>SharePlay</h2><br/>
SharePlay music control <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/26/shareplay-music-control-homepod-apple-tv/">is expanding</a> to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod/">HomePod</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a> with iOS 17.4 and tvOS 17.4. With the feature, a user's family and friends can control the music that is playing on a &zwnj;HomePod&zwnj; or an &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj;, so long as the user has granted permission.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/SharePlay-Music-Control-Expanding-Feature-2.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-933114" /><br/>
The person who owns the &zwnj;HomePod&zwnj; or the &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj; needs to have an &zwnj;Apple Music&zwnj; subscription, but the person who is granted SharePlay access can play music using &zwnj;Apple Music&zwnj; without a subscription.<br/>
<br/>
Connecting to a &zwnj;HomePod&zwnj; or &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj; to use SharePlay can be done by scanning a QR code on the device owner's &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; (for &zwnj;HomePod&zwnj;) or &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj;. Users can connect to a device while in the same space or remotely.<br/>
