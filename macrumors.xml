		<description><![CDATA[Apple, Google, and Amazon are urging India to reconsider its proposed Digital Competition Bill, citing concerns over increased user costs and potential reductions in investment (via <em><a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/google-amazon-apple-lobby-group-opposes-indias-eu-like-antitrust-proposal-2024-05-28/">Reuters</a></em>).<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/08/apple-india.jpg" alt="" width="2304" height="1296" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-756076" /><br/>
A U.S. lobby group representing major technology companies has asked the Indian government to rethink the proposed legislation that closely mirrors the European Union's Digital Markets Act. The request was made in a letter sent by the U.S.-India Business Council (USIBC), a part of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, to India's Corporate Affairs Ministry. The proposed Digital Competition Bill aims to regulate the market power of large digital firms with global revenues exceeding &#36;30 billion and at least 10 million local users.<br/>
<br/>
The Digital Competition Bill seeks to introduce measures to prevent companies from exploiting non-public user data and from giving preferential treatment to their own services over those of rivals. The bill would also remove restrictions on sideloading apps. <br/>
<br/>
The USIBC has raised concerns that these regulations could lead to significant repercussions for targeted companies like Apple. According to the council, the draft Indian law is "much further in scope" than the EU's regulations, potentially resulting in reduced investment in India, higher prices for digital services, and a decreased range of services available to consumers.<br/>
<br/>
The Indian government argues that the new law is necessary to address the growing market power of a few large digital companies that "wield immense control over the market." The proposed legislation includes provisions for penalties of up to 10 percent of a company's annual global turnover for violations.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/antitrust/">Apple Antitrust</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/india/">India</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/29/apple-pushes-back-against-india-regulations/">Apple Pushes Back Against India&#039;s New Digital Market Regulations</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-pushes-back-against-indias-new-digital-market-regulations.2427664/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It has been over a year and a half since the current Apple TV was released, so you may be wondering when a new model will be released. Below, we recap rumors about the next-generation Apple TV, including new features and lower pricing.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/10/apple-tv-4k-yellow-bg-feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-870258" /><br/>
The current Apple TV 4K was <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/10/18/apple-announces-apple-tv-with-a15-and-hdr10-for-129/">introduced in October 2022</a>. Key new features compared to the previous model from 2021 include a faster A15 Bionic chip, a larger 128GB storage option, a slightly thinner and lighter design, HDR10+ support, a USB-C port on the Siri Remote, a lower &#36;129 starting price vs. &#36;179, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/10/19/10-new-features-of-2022-apple-tv/">more</a>.<br/>
<br/>
In January 2023, <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman reported that a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/01/18/apple-tv-faster-chip-2024-launch/">new Apple TV was on track for release in the first half of 2024</a>:<blockquote>Beyond the future smart displays and new speaker, Apple is working on revamping its TV box. A new version with the current design is in the works for the first half of next year with a faster processor, the people said.</blockquote>With only one month remaining in the first half of 2024, it is unclear if this timeframe remains accurate. A new Apple TV could be unveiled at the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/28/wwdc-2024-full-schedule/">WWDC keynote on June 10</a>, but no hardware announcements have been firmly rumored for the event.<br/>
<br/>
Here is when the previous five Apple TV models were announced:<br/>
<br/>
<ul><li><strong>Third-generation Apple TV 4K:</strong> October 2022</li><br/>
<li><strong>Second-generation Apple TV 4K:</strong> April 2021</li><br/>
<li><strong>First-generation Apple TV 4K:</strong> September 2017</li><br/>
<li><strong>Apple TV HD:</strong> September 2015</li><br/>
<li><strong>Third-generation Apple TV:</strong> March 2012</li></ul><br/>
<br/>
Regardless of when it is unveiled, the next Apple TV is rumored to feature a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/01/18/apple-tv-faster-chip-2024-launch/">faster processor</a> than the current A15 Bionic chip, and even lower pricing. Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo suggested that the next Apple TV <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/10/18/kuo-even-cheaper-apple-tv/">could have a sub-&#36;100 starting price</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Both the second-generation (2010) and third-generation (2012) versions of the Apple TV were priced at &#36;99 in the U.S. at launch, and Apple eventually lowered the price of the third-generation model to &#36;69, so there is precedent for a sub-&#36;100 Apple TV that would better compete with low-priced streaming devices sold by Google, Amazon, and Roku.<br/>
<br/>
No major design changes have been rumored for the next Apple TV specifically, but Gurman said Apple has considered <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/07/apple-tv-with-camera-again-rumored/">adding a built-in camera</a> to a future model. tvOS 17 <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/use-iphone-facetime-camera-apple-tv/">added a FaceTime app to the Apple TV</a>, allowing for users to have video calls by using the rear camera on a connected iPhone or iPad. If the Apple TV gained a built-in camera, users would no longer need to rely on an external device for video calls on the TV.<br/>
<br/>
Should the WWDC keynote pass without any new Apple TV announcement, then there will no longer be any active rumor for when the next model might launch.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_TV">Apple TV (Caution)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-tv-and-home-theater.100">Apple TV and Home Theater</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/29/latest-apple-tv-rumors/">Apple TV: The Latest Rumors About a New Model and Possible &#36;99 Price</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-tv-the-latest-rumors-about-a-new-model-and-possible-99-price.2427662/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<title>What to Expect From CarPlay on iOS 18</title>

		<description><![CDATA[iOS 18 will be unveiled at Apple's annual developers conference WWDC in less than two weeks, and the update will include some new features for CarPlay.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/Apple-CarPlay-Dash.jpg" alt="" width="1306" height="734" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-934995" /><br/>
Below, we recap new accessibility features that Apple recently previewed for CarPlay, and discuss the current status of the promised next-generation CarPlay.<br/>
<br/>
The first beta of iOS 18 will likely be made available to members of the Apple Developer Program immediately following the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/28/wwdc-2024-full-schedule/">WWDC keynote on June 10</a>, and a public beta is usually released in July, which will allow iPhone users to test out the new CarPlay features. As usual, the update should be widely released in September.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>New Accessibility Features</h2><br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/CarPlay-Sound-Recognition.jpg" alt="" width="1306" height="718" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-950848" /><em>Sound Recognition is coming to CarPlay</em></div><br/>
In a press release earlier this month, Apple highlighted <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/15/ios-18-accessibility-features-for-carplay/">three new accessibility features</a> coming to CarPlay as part of iOS 18:<br/>
<br/>
<ul><li><strong>Voice Control:</strong> This feature will allow users to navigate CarPlay and control apps with just their voice.</li><br/>
<li><strong>Color Filters:</strong> This feature will make the CarPlay interface visually easier to use for individuals with color blindness.</li><br/>
<li><strong>Sound Recognition:</strong> This feature will enable drivers or passengers who are deaf or hard of hearing to receive notifications on CarPlay for driving-related sounds, such as car horns and sirens.</li></ul>All three of these features are already available on the iPhone and iPad.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Next-Generation CarPlay</h2><br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/12/Next-Generation-CarPlay-Porsche-1.png" alt="" width="1200" height="675" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-927534" /><em>Porsche's next-generation CarPlay preview</em></div><br/>
It has been nearly two years since Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/06/06/apple-announces-multi-display-carplay/">first previewed next-generation CarPlay</a> at WWDC 2022, and it has still yet to become available in any vehicles.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="https://www.apple.com/ios/carplay/">Apple's website says</a> the first vehicle models with next-generation CarPlay will "arrive in 2024," but nothing has materialized yet. Aston Martin and Porsche <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/20/first-next-generation-carplay-vehicles-announced/">previewed next-generation CarPlay designs</a> in December, but Aston Martin has been silent ever since and Porsche continues to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/28/24166210/porsche-911-carrera-gts-hybrid-apple-carplay">release vehicles without next-generation CarPlay</a>. In addition, Mercedes-Benz has seemingly <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/29/24144356/mercedes-benz-ceo-apple-carplay-next-gen-decoder">reversed course on adopting next-generation CarPlay</a>, despite being on Apple's list of committed automakers shown at WWDC 2022.<br/>
<br/>
At this point, it is looking like next-generation CarPlay will debut with iOS 18, but it <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/25/ios-17-4-next-generation-carplay/">could be compatible with some iOS 17 versions</a> too.<br/>
<br/>
Apple said next-generation CarPlay will have deeper integration with a vehicle's instrument cluster, climate controls, FM radio, and more.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/carplay/">CarPlay</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/homepod-homekit-carplay-home-auto-technology.193">HomePod, HomeKit, CarPlay, Home & Auto Technology</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/29/what-to-expect-from-carplay-on-ios-18/">What to Expect From CarPlay on iOS 18</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/what-to-expect-from-carplay-on-ios-18.2427659/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Popular weather prediction app CARROT Weather was today updated to version 6.0, introducing a refreshed design with changes to the user interface and feature set. The app now features a garden, which is the new default look of the app.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/carrot-weather.png" alt="" width="3340" height="1878" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-952529" /><br/>
The garden is designed to grow and change over time, with little robots pruning trees, watering plants, and delivering supplies throughout the day. The garden resets at the start of each month for a dynamic experience throughout the year. While the garden is the default design, premium users can opt to keep their current layouts.<br/>
<br/>
CARROT Weather includes a new Hourly Forecast with a data point picker for selecting weather data that will show up on the main screen, plus there are more than a dozen layout options available in the Settings section of the app. Premium users can choose new styles for Weather Alerts, Minutely Forecast, Hourly Forecast, and Daily Forecast.<br/>
<br/>
The app includes weather news that provides insight into major weather events that are happening around the globe. Articles are sourced from Accuweather and stories for the local area will appear higher up in the layout. CARROT Weather is also gaining yesterday's temperature, which is a new popup that compares the current daily temperature with yesterday's weather when the app is first opened in the morning.<br/>
<br/>
CARROT Weather can be downloaded from the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a> for free, but unlocking additional features requires the premium version, priced starting at &#36;20/year.

Priced at &#36;79.99, Beats Solo Buds deliver 18 hours of battery life and come in the smallest case ever designed for Beats earbuds. The case does not contain its own battery, and an external power source must be connected to the case via USB-C to recharge the buds.<br/>
<br/>

Beats Solo Buds feature a custom-built acoustic architecture and an ergonomic design with four ear tip size options for a precise fit. There is no active noise cancelation on the Beats Solo Buds, but they do offer passive noise isolation to improve audio quality. A custom microphone design paired with an advanced noise-learning algorithm help deliver improved call quality.<br/>

Beats Solo Buds will be launching at Apple and authorized resellers and will be available in four colors: Matte Black, Storm Gray, Arctic Purple, and Transparent Red. In the United States, the Arctic Purple color will be exclusive to Apple and Target, both in-store and online.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/beats/">Beats</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/29/beats-solo-buds-launch-date/">Beats Solo Buds Available to Order June 18, Launching June 20</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/beats-solo-buds-available-to-order-june-18-launching-june-20.2427654/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple is set to open its <a href="https://www.apple.com/my/exchangetrx/">first retail store in Malaysia</a> on June 22, marking a significant expansion of its physical retail presence in south-east Asia. The new store will be located in Kuala Lumpur at The Exchange TRX mall.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/apple-trx-mall-16-9.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-952534" /><br/>
The store features a unique, tiered white pyramid architectural design. This will be the sixth <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-store/">Apple Store</a> in south-east Asia, following three in Singapore and two in Thailand.<br/>
<br/>
Apple now has a <a href="https://www.apple.com/my/exchangetrx/">webpage</a> for the store and shared a number of <a href="https://www.apple.com/my/exchangetrx/">wallpapers</a> for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>, and Mac to celebrate its opening, incorporating the Apple logo and the word "Jom," which means "let's go" or "come on" in Malay. <br/>
<br/>
While Apple does not manufacture iPhones in Malaysia, it does produce some Mac models in the country. Apple's decision to establish a retail store in Malaysia is part of its strategy to expand its retail footprint in key Asian markets, where it faces fierce competition from local tech companies.<br/>
<br/>
Apple The Exchange TRX will officially open its doors for the first time at 10 a.m. local time on June 22.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/retail/">Retail</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/29/apple-to-open-first-retail-store-in-malaysia/">Apple to Open First Retail Store in Malaysia on June 22</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-to-open-first-retail-store-in-malaysia-on-june-22.2427644/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe title="Job Simulator I Apple Vision Pro Trailer" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uD5RQbGkGzI" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div><br/>
Job Simulator is a VR game where automation and robots have replaced all human jobs. Players can relive what it was like to work as a human with not-so historically accurate recreations of jobs that include an office worker, gourmet chef, and store clerk.<br/>
<br/>
The game uses hand tracking for control purposes, which means no controller is required. Hands can be used for interacting with, throwing, and smashing objects.<br/>
<br/>
Vacation Simulator is similar to Job Simulator, but it provides a simulated vacation experience. Activities include ice sculpting, swimming, knitting mittens, building snowhumans, doing yoga, painting, taking selfies, and more in forest, mountain, and beach scenes.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe title="Vacation Simulator I Apple Vision Pro Trailer" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/O6m4PrvA_R8" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div><br/>
Vacation Simulator and Job Simulator have previously been available on Steam VR, Oculus devices, and PlayStationVR, and were released in 2019 and 2016, respectively. <br/>
<br/>
Job Simulator is available from the Vision Pro <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a> for &#36;19.99, while Vacation Simulator is priced at &#36;29.99.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/28/job-simulator-vision-pro/">VR Games Job Simulator and Vacation Simulator Launch on Apple Vision Pro</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/vr-games-job-simulator-and-vacation-simulator-launch-on-apple-vision-pro.2427621/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[T-Mobile <a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/news/business/uscellular-acquisition-operations-assets">today announced plans</a> to purchase UScellular's wireless operations for &#36;4.4 billion, a deal that includes UScellular's wireless customers, stores, and select cellular spectrum.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/T-Mobile-Generic-Feature-Pink-1.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-951944" /><br/>
According to T-Mobile, the purchase will provide millions of UScellular customers access to the T-Mobile network, improving connectivity in underserved rural areas. T-Mobile also plans to use the spectrum and wireless assets from UScellular to expand its home broadband offerings.<br/>
<br/>
T-Mobile's press release suggests that wireless customers across the United States will "benefit from enhanced choice and competition," wording aimed at the federal regulators who will need to approve the deal. UScellular will retain ownership of some of its spectrum and its towers, with T-Mobile planning to lease space on approximately 2,000 towers.<br/>
<br/>
UScellular customers will have the option to stay on their existing plans or move to an unlimited T-Mobile plan with no switching costs.<br/>
<br/>
T-Mobile has previously acquired MetroPCS and Sprint, with the latter merger <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2019/11/06/fcc-approves-t-mobile-sprint-merger/">occurring in 2020</a> after it was previously <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2017/11/04/sprint-t-mobile-call-off-merger/">called off in 2014</a>. U.S. regulators have been concerned with the lack of a fourth major carrier in the United States and could be hesitant to approve yet another T-Mobile purchase.<br/>
<br/>
T-Mobile says that the deal should close in mid-2025.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/28/tmobile-uscellular-acquisition/">T-Mobile Announces UScellular Acquisition, Promises Improved Connectivity in Rural Areas</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/t-mobile-announces-uscellular-acquisition-promises-improved-connectivity-in-rural-areas.2427618/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[YouTube is the latest company to introduce mobile games that are available outside of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a>, today announcing <a href="https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/youtube-playables/">the official launch</a> of "Playables" in the YouTube app.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/youtube-playables.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-952517" /><br/>
Playables are free games that can be played on the YouTube website or in the YouTube app for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>. There are more than 75 games available, including Angry Birds Showdown and Cut the Rope.<br/>
<br/>
YouTube is focusing on "lightweight, entertaining games," so many of the options are games that are meant to be played for a short period of time rather than longer games that you might find on the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj;. Game progress is saved, and YouTube keeps track of all-time best scores.<br/>
<br/>
Playables have been available for a small number of users in select markets as YouTube has tested the feature, but as of today, the games are rolling out to everyone and are more widely available. Playables can be accessed in the iOS app by going to the Explore menu and choosing the Playables section.<br/>
<br/>
Netflix has offered a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/14/netflix-games-tvs-macs-pcs/">selection of in-app games</a> since 2021, and has started testing games on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a> as well.

		<description><![CDATA[LEGO has an "Ideas" website that allows fans to submit mockups and suggestions for future LEGO sets, and one fan recently <a href="https://ideas.lego.com/projects/798c9236-c87f-40be-a740-3166f919c8b6">designed a detailed Apple Store</a> that any Apple enthusiast would love to build.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/lego-apple-store.jpg" alt="" width="1350" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-952512" /><br/>
The LEGO <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-store/">Apple Store</a>'s design isn't made to resemble a specific store, but instead uses the design elements that Apple has incorporated into many of its locations. There's an all-glass facade with trees in pots, minifigures in classic Apple blue shirts, and an upstairs area reached by a set of stairs.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/lego-apple-store-exterior.jpg" alt="" width="1350" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-952513" /><br/>
Inside, there are tables with different iPhones and Macs on display, a section for headphones, and product boxes on shelves. There's also a colorful display upstairs, a big white Apple logo at the front of the store, and exterior area housing large versions of some of Apple's most iconic products.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/lego-apple-store-inside.jpg" alt="" width="1350" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-952514" /><br/>
If the LEGO &zwnj;Apple Store&zwnj; gets 10,000 "supporters" or votes on the LEGO ideas site, LEGO will review it and will consider it for an official retail set. It is unclear if Apple would approve such a set, and it is unknown if it will pass LEGO's review. LEGO evaluates submissions based on existing products, products already in development, brand fit, expected demand, licensing possibilities, build quality, and more.<br/>
<br/>
The set comes from Legotruman, who has had several other ideas reviewed by LEGO staff, and who was responsible for <a href="https://ideas.lego.com/projects/acc7c4c8-3967-4563-8fb5-a49859fa7755">the Starry Night LEGO</a> set that is now available for sale.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/lego/">LEGO</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/28/lego-apple-store/">Check Out This LEGO Apple Store</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/check-out-this-lego-apple-store.2427611/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today stopped signing iOS 17.5, preventing <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> users from downgrading to that version of iOS. The update is no longer being signed after the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/20/apple-releases-ios-17-5-1-photos-bug/">May 20 release of iOS 17.5.1</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/iOS-17.5-Feature-Green-and-Purple.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-940351" /><br/>
It is not unusual for Apple to stop signing an older version of iOS, and it typically happens a week or two after a new version of iOS comes out. When an update is no longer signed, it means it is no longer able to be installed on an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; per a server side software verification check.<br/>
<br/>
Apple prevents users from installing older versions of iOS to encourage customers to keep their operating systems up to date with the latest security improvements.<br/>
<br/>
iOS 17.5.1 addressed a corruption bug that could cause <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/20/apple-releases-ios-17-5-1-photos-bug/">deleted photos to reappear on an iPhone</a>.

		<description><![CDATA[Nomad today announced the launch of the <a href="https://nomadgoods.com/products/tracking-card">Tracking Card</a>, a super thin Find My-enabled card that is designed to be carried in a wallet so that it's trackable with an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/nomad-tracking-card.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-952503" /><br/>
The Tracking Card is about the thickness of two credit cards (2mm), so it doesn't take up too much space in a wallet. It's also credit card sized, which means it can be carried right alongside other cards. There are several <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/find-my-network-accessory-program/">Find My</a> cards on the market now, and 2mm is among the thinnest that are available. The Eufy SmartTrack, Chipolo CARD Spot, and Tile Slim are all a bit thicker.<br/>
<br/>
One side of the black plastic card is largely plain except for a logo, and the other side has a second subtle Nomad logo with light gray lines representing the hardware that's inside the card. It's not identifiable as a &zwnj;Find My&zwnj; tracking card, so if someone steals your wallet, it won't immediately tip the thief off that it's trackable. It actually looks a lot like a key card.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/nomad-tracking-card-2.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-952504" /><br/>
There's a hidden button on the card that's pressed to add it to &zwnj;Find My&zwnj;, and adding it to the app is as simple as opening it up, pressing the "+" button, and then holding down the pairing button on the Tracking Card. From there, it can be given a name and an icon, and it's trackable right alongside other &zwnj;Find My&zwnj; items and also Apple devices with &zwnj;Find My&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
Nomad's Tracking Card connects to the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; over Bluetooth, but it is also able to take advantage of the full &zwnj;Find My&zwnj; network, utilizing nearby Apple devices if it is out of range of your own &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;. &zwnj;Find My&zwnj; provides the current location if it's with you, or the Tracking Card's last known location if it's been located with the &zwnj;Find My&zwnj; network.<br/>
<br/>
When nearby, the Tracking Card can play a sound via &zwnj;Find My&zwnj;, which is helpful for locating your wallet if it's been misplaced in the home or nearby. There is no Precision Finding as there is with Apple devices, so the &zwnj;Find My&zwnj; app can't lead you directly to the Tracking Card. The beeping is not loud enough to hear it from another room in most cases, especially if it's buried in couch cushions or similarly hidden, but it should be loud enough if you're in the same room with the card.<br/>
<br/>
You can set the Tracking Card to notify you if it's left behind, which means it sends an alert when your &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; gets out of range. That's perhaps the most useful feature of the &zwnj;Find My&zwnj; network because it lets you know right away if you've misplaced or dropped something.<br/>
<br/>
There are options to get directions to the Tracking Card in the &zwnj;Find My&zwnj; app, plus you can share it with family members so they can track it and Lost Mode is available for adding your contact information should your wallet be lost. As with other &zwnj;Find My&zwnj; accessories, Nomad is able to deliver firmware updates should new software be needed.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps the best feature of the Tracking Card is the battery. The battery inside can be recharged by putting the card on a Qi-based charger, and the markings on the card show the alignment. I tested the card with several Qi/<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe-battery-pack/">MagSafe</a> chargers and they were all able to provide power, with charging indicated by a small red LED on the card. The light turns green when it's fully charged, and turns off when there's no charger connected. There is a small amount of metal inside, but it's enough that it's able to be attached to upright chargers as well as flat chargers. There isn't a magnet in the card so it's not going to affect the magnetic stripe on credit and debit cards. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/nomad-tracking-card-3.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-952505" /><br/>
According to Nomad, a single charge should last for around five months, so it isn't going to need to be charged often. Nomad says IPX7 waterproofing is included, so if the card happens to get wet, it'll survive.<br/>
<br/>
Many of the wallet-sized Bluetooth trackers on the market do not have a rechargeable or replaceable battery inside, so it's nice that Nomad has designed the Tracking Card to last more than a couple of years. With the Chipolo Card Spot or Eufy SmartTrack, the entire device needs to be thrown out when the built-in battery dies.<br/>
<br/>
At &#36;40, Nomad's Tracking Card is about &#36;10 more expensive than some competing products from well-known companies like Chipolo, but it does have built-in wireless charging and a slim design. There are some &zwnj;Find My&zwnj; wallet tracking cards <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FReyke-Tracker-Wireless-Charging-Passports%2Fdp%2FB0CT38WDJC%2F">on Amazon</a> with the same Qi technology for around &#36;10 to &#36;15 less, so Qi charging for trackers isn't a totally new idea. Of course, these are not known Apple accessory makers so quality and functionality is unverified, plus the reviews are mixed, but there are other options out there.<br/>
<br/>
Note that like all &zwnj;Find My&zwnj; Bluetooth tracking accessories, the Tracking Card from Nomad only works with Apple devices. It cannot be used on the Android platform.<br/>
<br/>
Nomad's Tracking Card can be <a href="https://nomadgoods.com/products/tracking-card">purchased from the Nomad website</a> as of today.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today released new firmware update for both the Lightning and USB-C versions of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/">AirPods Pro</a> 2. The new firmware is version 6F7, up from the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/05/apple-releases-new-airpods-pro-2-firmware-6b34/">6B34 firmware</a> released in November.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-867348" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/09/airpods-pro-2-pink.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" /><br/>
Apple does not provide details on what features might be included in the refreshed firmware beyond "bug fixes and other improvements," so it is unclear what's new in the update.<br/>
<br/>
Apple does not give customers instructions on how to upgrade AirPods software, but firmware is generally installed over-the-air while the ‌‌AirPods‌‌ are connected to an iOS device. Putting the ‌‌‌‌‌AirPods‌‌‌‌‌ in the case, connecting the ‌‌‌‌‌AirPods‌‌‌‌‌ to a power source, and then pairing the ‌‌‌‌‌AirPods‌‌‌‌‌ to an iOS device or Mac should force the update.<br/>
<br/>
You can check your ‌‌‌AirPods‌‌ firmware by following these steps:<br/>
<ul><br/>
 	<li>Connect your ‌‌‌‌‌‌&zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj;‌‌‌‌‌‌ to your iOS device.</li><br/>
 	<li>Open the Settings app.</li><br/>
 	<li>Tap General.</li><br/>
 	<li>Tap About.</li><br/>
 	<li>Tap ‌‌‌‌‌AirPods‌‌‌‌‌.</li><br/>
 	<li>Look at the number next to "Firmware Version."</li><br/>
</ul><br/>
If we learn more about what's new in the firmware release, we'll update this article.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/28/apple-airpods-pro-firmware-6f7/">Apple Releases New AirPods Pro 2 Firmware</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-releases-new-airpods-pro-2-firmware.2427600/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/wwdc-2024-main-image-feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-944281" /><br/>
While WWDC always includes a keynote, Apple has confirmed that it will be held on June 10 at 10:00 a.m. Pacific Time. Apple is expected to announce <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a>, iPadOS 18, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-15/">macOS 15</a>, tvOS 18, watchOS 11, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/visionos/">visionOS</a> 2, and at this time, we have not heard rumors of hardware.<br/>
<br/>
Apple will follow the keynote with the Platforms State of the Union, and the Apple Design Awards are typically also held on the same day.<br/>
<ul><br/>
 	<li><strong>10:00 a.m. PDT</strong> - Apple Keynote, which provides a first look at "groundbreaking updates" coming to Apple platforms later in the year.</li><br/>
 	<li><strong>1:00 p.m. PDT</strong> - Platforms State of the Union, which will take a deeper dive into the latest advances across iOS, iPadOS, macOS, tvOS, &zwnj;visionOS&zwnj;, and watchOS, and new tools that will further empower Apple developers.</li><br/>
</ul><br/>
The keynote event will be available to stream on Apple's website, the Apple Developer App, the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a> app, and YouTube. The Platforms State of the Union will be available on the Apple Developer app and the Apple Developer website.<br/>
<br/>
A select number of developers have been invited to a viewing party at the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-park/">Apple Park</a> campus in Cupertino, California, and they will be able to watch the keynote and the Platforms State of the Union in person.<br/>
<br/>
Throughout WWDC week, Apple is hosting online labs and consultations for developers to get advice on implementing the new features that Apple plans to announce at WWDC, plus there will be more than 100 technical sessions from Apple engineers, designers, and other experts.<br/>
<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Back at CES in January, Belkin confirmed that <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/07/ces-2024-belkin-chargers-auto-tracking-stand/">several wireless chargers using the Qi2 standard</a> based on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe-battery-pack/">MagSafe</a> would soon be rolling out, and I've recently been able to spend some time testing out the <a href="https://belkin.evyy.net/QyM9GP">BoostCharge 2-in-1 Magnetic Charging Pad</a> from that lineup.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/belkin-2-in-1-pad-parts.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-952178" /><br/>
As the name suggests, the BoostCharge 2-in-1 Magnetic Charging Pad with Qi2 15W is a flat pad-style charger offering two surfaces on which to charge devices. One side has a Qi2 wireless charging pad supporting recent <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> models at up to their maximum of 15 watts, while the other is a 5-watt Qi pad intended to work with AirPods models with wireless charging cases. Other devices which support Qi wireless charging like phones can also be charged on the pad, though they will not align magnetically and will charge at a much slower speed compared to using the Qi2 pad.<br/>
<br/>
In my testing, I found that the Qi2 pad didn't charge my <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a> Max quite as quickly as Apple's &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; Charger does, but it was fairly close and definitely faster than an original Qi pad which is limited to 7.5 watts for iPhones. The pad was able to boost my &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;'s battery from 30% to around 70% in an hour, though as with all other charging methods, the rate began to slow significantly beyond about 80% to prevent overheating and overcharging as the battery began approaching a full charge.<br/>
<br/>
In addition to the two wireless charging pads, the BoostCharge 2-in-1 Magnetic Charging Pad includes an additional USB-C port supporting up to 5 watts of output, allowing for wired charging of other devices such as an Apple Watch with an appropriate cable. (If you prefer integrated Apple Watch charging, Belkin also offers a <a href="https://belkin.evyy.net/KjM6Pn">BoostCharge 3-in-1 Magnetic Charging Pad</a> with an Apple Watch charging puck already included to attach to that USB-C port.)<br/>
<br/>
The BoostCharge 2-in-1 Magnetic Charging Pad is available in either black or white, and the unit is powered by a color-matched 30-watt power adapter and 5-foot (1.5-meter) USB-C to USB-C cable, with both thankfully included in the box. The U.S. power adapter is similar in size and shape to Apple's 20-watt USB-C adapter and unfortunately does not include folding prongs, which would have been convenient for travel. You're of course free to use any USB-C power source of 30 watts or more, so it's easy enough to substitute something that better fits your needs, but I would have liked to see a more travel-friendly adapter right in the box.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/belkin-2-in-1-pad-top.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-952179" /><br/>
The pad design itself is ideal for travel as its minimal thickness allows it to fit nicely in a computer bag or backpack. It is on the heavy side though at around 11 ounces (310 grams) plus the cable and power adapter, which might hamper portability a bit. That heft does, however, contribute to stability on surfaces and makes it easier to detach an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; sitting on the magnetic pad. At around 6.4 x 3.2 x 0.6 inches (16.3 x 8.2 x 1.5 cm), the unit is pretty close to the size of an &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; Max but somewhat thicker due to the slightly elevated Qi2 pad.<br/>
<br/>
The body of the charger is a matte plastic with some arcs of rubber-like material on the bottom to protect surfaces and limit sliding. The Qi2 charging pad on the left has a similar rubber-like surface to protect your phone from scratches, while the lower-power Qi pad on the right is simply a shallow depression in the smooth, hard plastic to help with accurate placement of an AirPods case for charging. Some magnets would have been nice to ensure easy alignment of AirPods cases supporting that feature, but I didn't have any trouble getting my AirPods to register properly with the charger.<br/>
<br/>
The extra USB-C output port is on the right side of the unit, while the USB-C input port is on the rear. There's no status light for the Qi2 pad, but the AirPods pad has a small LED status light in front of it that shines white while a device is charging or orange if there is a charging error. It also briefly flashes white upon plugging the pad in, confirming the unit is receiving power.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/belkin-2-in-1-pad-ports.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="703" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-952180" /><br/>
Overall, I've found the BoostCharge 2-in-1 Magnetic Charging Pad to be a reliable wireless charging accessory with some nice features but also some minor drawbacks. It has a relatively travel-friendly design, features a clean, unobtrusive look, and reliably charges devices, but the lack of magnetic alignment for the AirPods charging spot and lack of folding prongs on the power adapter are missed opportunities in my opinion.<br/>
<br/>
While the pad design is simple and convenient for travel, some may prefer an angled charging surface for better visibility of the screen while their phone is charging on a desk or nightstand. Fortunately, Belkin offers chargers with that design as well, and even some that convert between the two, so you've got options.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="https://belkin.evyy.net/QyM9GP">Belkin's BoostCharge 2-in-1 Magnetic Charging Pad</a> is priced at &#36;79.99 in either black or white on both Belkin's site and <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FBelkin-BoostCharge-MagSafe-Compatible-Wireless-Additional%2Fdp%2FB0CRSVJQMD">Amazon</a>. One of the anticipated advantages of Qi2 was the ability to have &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; charging performance without the need for Apple's &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; licensing that drives costs up, but Belkin's similar <a href="https://belkin.evyy.net/vNJK0d">BoostCharge Pro 2-in-1 Wireless Charging Pad with Official MagSafe Charging</a> is priced at the exact same &#36;79.99. It does lack the extra USB-C output port that the Qi2 model has, but still, I've been hoping for bigger cost savings with Qi2 over &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; than I've seen so far.<br/>
<br/>
As I mentioned previously, in addition to the 2-in-1 model, <a href="https://belkin.evyy.net/KjM6Pn">Belkin also offers a 3-in-1 model</a> that includes an Apple Watch fast charger which mounts directly to the extra USB-C port on the main body of the unit. But due in part to licensing and sourcing of official Apple Watch charging components, moving to the 3-in-1 model adds a whopping &#36;50 to the price, bringing it to &#36;129.99.<br/>
<br/>
Alternatively, you could get the 2-in-1 model and then spend just &#36;29 for an official USB-C Apple Watch charging cable to plug into that USB-C port. It's not as clean a solution as the direct-attach module from Belkin, but it'll save you &#36;20, or there are other multi-device charging solutions available to fit your particular needs.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2024/05/apple-hearing-study-shares-preliminary-insights-on-tinnitus/">shared an update</a> on the Apple Hearing Study that reveals new insights into the hearing condition tinnitus.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/apple-hearing-study.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-952448" /><br/>
In one of the largest surveys on tinnitus to date, researchers from the University of Michigan examined data from over 160,000 participants using Apple devices. Tinnitus, defined as the perception of sound without an external source, can manifest as ringing, buzzing, or other sounds and can impact quality of life by disrupting sleep, concentration, and clear hearing.<br/>
<br/>
The study found that 77.6% of participants had experienced tinnitus at some point in their lives. The prevalence of daily tinnitus increased with age, with those aged 55 and older being three times more likely to experience it daily compared to younger participants aged 18-34. Male participants reported a slightly higher incidence of daily tinnitus, at 2.7% more than females, but a higher percentage of males stated they had never experienced tinnitus.<br/>
<br/>
Participants reported employing various methods to manage their tinnitus. The most common strategies included using noise machines, listening to nature sounds, and practicing meditation. Regarding the causes of tinnitus, the study highlighted that noise trauma or exposure to excessively high noise levels was the primary reported cause, cited by 20.3% of participants. Apple highlighted several ways in which its devices can help support hearing health:<br/>
<br/>
<ul><br/>
  <li><b>Noise app</b>: The Noise app on the Apple Watch can notify users when environmental noise levels may impact their hearing health. The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>'s Health app tracks a user's history of sound level exposure and indicates if headphone audio or environmental noise levels exceed World Health Organization standards.</li><br/>
  <li><b>Environmental sound levels</b>: Users can view environmental sound levels over the course of a week on the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; and check noise levels in decibels on the Apple Watch, ensuring their exposure remains within safe limits.</li><br/>
  <li><b>Active Noise Cancellation and Loud Sound Reduction mode</b>: Active Noise Cancellation on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/">AirPods Pro</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-max/">AirPods Max</a> uses built-in microphones to detect and counter external sounds with anti-noise, effectively canceling them before they reach the user's ears. For those who still wish to hear surrounding sounds, the Loud Sound Reduction mode on &zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj; (2nd generation) reduces loud noises while maintaining sound quality.</li><br/>
  <li><b>Reduce loud audio</b>: To set a headphone volume limit, users can navigate to Settings, tap "Sounds & Haptics" (on &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 7 and later) or "Sounds" (for earlier models), then tap "Headphone Safety" to enable "Reduce Loud Audio" and adjust the slider to the desired decibel level.</li><br/>
</ul><br/>
<br/>
The Apple Hearing Study, conducted in collaboration with the University of Michigan, seeks to advance understanding of sound exposure and its impact on hearing health. The study has already accumulated approximately 400 million hours of calculated environmental sound levels, supplemented by lifestyle surveys, to analyze how sound exposure affects hearing, stress, and related health aspects. The data collected is also being shared with the World Health Organization as part of its Make Listening Safe initiative.
