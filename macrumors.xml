		<description><![CDATA[The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/02/apple-seeds-ios-17-5-beta-1-to-developers/">first beta of iOS 17.5</a> potentially references a new fourth-generation Apple Pencil, amid rumors that the accessory will be updated soon.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/apple-pencil.jpeg" alt="" width="2048" height="1152" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-939786" /><br/>
The beta includes a hidden code reference to a "V4" version of the Apple Pencil, according to <em>MacRumors</em> contributor <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/author/steve-moser/">Steve Moser</a>:<blockquote>NumberOfApplePencilV1ConnectionsCount<br/>
NumberOfApplePencilV2ConnectionsCount<br/>
NumberOfApplePencilV3ConnectionsCount<br/>
NumberOfApplePencilV4ConnectionsCount</blockquote>A new Apple Pencil is rumored to launch <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/28/new-ipad-models-may-launch/">alongside updated iPad Pro and iPad Air models in May</a>. Apple refers to the USB-C version of the Apple Pencil released last year as the third-generation Apple Pencil in iOS code, so the fourth-generation model would be a new version that would likely succeed the second-generation Apple Pencil.<br/>
<br/>
Additional code in the iOS 17.5 beta uncovered by <em>MacRumors</em> contributor <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/author/aaron-perris/">Aaron Perris</a> suggests that the Apple Pencil could gain a "squeeze" gesture for certain actions, but details are slim. The gesture may provide users with a quicker way to add a sticker, text box, signature, or shape in image editing apps, the code suggests.<br/>
<br/>
<em>MacRumors</em> exclusively reported that Apple has <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/25/apple-pencil-visionon-support-in-testing/">tested a new Apple Pencil with visionOS support</a>, but it is unclear if this feature will be released to the public.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-17/">iPadOS 17</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-pencil/">Apple Pencil</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-17.241">iOS 17</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-17.242">iPadOS 17</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipad-accessories.139">iPad Accessories</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/03/ios-17-5-apple-pencil-4-rumor/">iOS 17.5 Potentially References New Apple Pencil and &#039;Squeeze&#039; Gesture</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-17-5-potentially-references-new-apple-pencil-and-squeeze-gesture.2423447/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple launched the original <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> 14 years ago today, starting a product line that has gone on to define the tablet space and entry-level computing, spur a shift in how media is consumed, and have immense cultural impact.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/01/steve-jobs-ipad-2010.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="720" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-780535" /><br/>
The original &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; launched on April 3, 2010. Designed to bridge the gap between the laptop and the smartphone, the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; offered a unique combination of portability, ease of use, and versatility that appealed to a wide range of consumers and professionals.<br/>
<br/>
At the heart of the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj;'s success was its sleek design and simple iOS user interface. The 9.7-inch touchscreen provided users with an immersive experience that was unmatched at the time. Its initial release boasted 16 to 64 gigabytes of storage, a 30-pin connector, Wi-Fi connectivity, and, on some models, 3G connectivity. This combination of features and the quality of its build set it apart from competitors, establishing the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; as a premium option in the emerging tablet market.<br/>
<br/>
The &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; catalyzed a shift in the software industry, leading to the development of apps designed specifically for its larger screen, which increasingly differed from the smartphone applications of the time. This app ecosystem rapidly expanded, with developers creating a wide range of applications from productivity tools and games to educational software. The &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; went on to be vital to the education market and many mobile workflows.<br/>
<br/>
The lineup has since expanded to include new models like the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-mini/">iPad mini</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/">iPad Air</a>, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a>. The introduction of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-pencil/">Apple Pencil</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/smart-keyboard/">Smart Keyboard</a> further transformed the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; from a simple media consumption device to a tool designed for creativity and productivity. <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/visionos/">visionOS</a>, the operating system behind the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a> headset, is also based on iPadOS to a large extent.<br/>
<br/>
Today, it has been <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com">almost 18 months</a> since any new iPads have launched – the longest-ever wait for new models. 2023 was the only year since the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj;'s introduction <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/01/apple-just-broke-a-tradition-it-held-for-12-years/">with no new iPad models</a>. Apple is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/28/new-ipad-models-may-launch/">now expected</a> to release refreshed &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; models in May, with updates to the entry-level &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; and the &zwnj;iPad mini&zwnj; tabled for later in the year. <div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPad">iPad (Don't Buy)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipad.137">iPad</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/03/ipad-launched-14-years-ago/">The iPad Launched 14 Years Ago Today as Longest-Ever Wait for New Models Continues</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/the-ipad-launched-14-years-ago-today-as-longest-ever-wait-for-new-models-continues.2423442/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Amazon today has Apple's fifth generation 64GB Wi-Fi iPad Air for <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB09V3HN1KC%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1"><strong>&#36;449.00</strong></a>, down from &#36;599.00. This is a match of the record low price on the tablet, and it's available in all colors except Starlight, with delivery as soon as this Friday, April 5.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/iPad-Air-150-Off-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="1304" height="734" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-933761" /><em><small>Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with Amazon. When you click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment, which helps us keep the site running.</small></em><br/>
<br/>
The last time we tracked this deal it was at Best Buy, but right now Amazon is beating Best Buy's deal on the same tablet by about &#36;50. There are quite a few <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB09V3L141V%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1">&#36;100 markdowns on other fifth generation M1 iPad Air models</a>, but none are matching all-time low prices like the 64GB Wi-Fi model.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB09V3HN1KC%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1"target="_blank"><div class="fancybutton"><div class="fancybadge">&#36;150 OFF</div>iPad Air (64GB Wi-Fi) for &#36;449.00</div></a></div><br/>
<br/>
Like other iPads, the M1 iPad Air is getting up there in age, having launched back in March 2022. Because of the imminent launch of new models, we're starting to see more consistent discounts on the 2022 tablets, which are still solid options for anyone who doesn't care about waiting for the new sixth generation devices.<br/>

As part of this initiative, Apple promised to expand AirTag-like "Found Moving With You" alerts to third-party item trackers in a future software update, which may be iOS 17.5.<br/>
<br/>

<em>MacRumors</em> contributor <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/author/steve-moser/">Steve Moser</a> uncovered several new references to alerts for third-party item trackers in the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/02/apple-seeds-ios-17-5-beta-1-to-developers/">first beta of iOS 17.5</a>, released this week. For example: "You can disable this item and stop it from sharing its location with the owner. To do this, follow the instructions provided on a website by the manufacturer of this item."<br/>

Tile, Chipolo, Samsung, Eufy, and Pebblebee all expressed support for the industry specification, according to <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2023/05/apple-google-partner-on-an-industry-specification-to-address-unwanted-tracking/">Apple's announcement</a> last year.<br/>

<br/>
Apple launched its savings account <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/17/apple-card-savings-account-launching-today/">in April 2023</a>, in partnership with Goldman Sachs. The account can be opened and managed in the Wallet app on the iPhone, and it has no fees, no minimum deposits, and no minimum balance requirements. You must have an Apple Card, be a U.S. resident, and be at least 18 years old to open an account.<br/>
<br/>
The account allows Apple Card holders to earn interest on their Daily Cash cashback balance, and on funds deposited via a linked bank account or an Apple Cash balance. The maximum balance allowed <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/01/apple-card-savings-1-million-limit/">is now &#36;1,000,000</a>, up from a previous limit of &#36;250,000.<br/>
<br/>
When the account first became available, Apple and Goldman Sachs offered an APY of 4.15%. The rate then increased three times, first to 4.25%, then to 4.35%, and finally to 4.5%. The drop to 4.4% is the first time the rate has gone down.<br/>
<br/>
To open a savings account in the Wallet app, tap on your Apple Card, tap on the circle with three dots at the top of the screen, tap Daily Cash, and select Set Up Savings.<br/>
<br/>
Goldman Sachs reportedly plans to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/28/apple-goldman-sachs-partnership-ending/">end its consumer lending partnership with Apple</a>, but it is unclear if this will have any impact on Apple Card holders.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-card/">Apple Card</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/03/apple-card-savings-rate-comparison-april/">Apple Card Savings Account&#039;s Interest Rate Lowered to 4.4% Today</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-card-savings-accounts-interest-rate-lowered-to-4-4-today.2423294/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<title>Major Earthquake in Taiwan Halts Some Apple Chip Production Lines</title>

		<description><![CDATA[A major earthquake in Taiwan has halted some TSMC chip production lines, potentially impacting the manufacture of Apple devices (via <em><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-04-03/tsmc-evacuates-production-lines-after-major-taiwan-quake">Bloomberg</a></em>).<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/10/Apple-Silicon-Teal-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-767478" /><br/>
A 7.4-magnitude earthquake struck Taiwan in the early hours of the morning, killing at least nine people, injuring hundreds, and causing significant damage to infrastructure, including disrupting operations at several TSMC key manufacturing sites. Sources familiar with TSMC's operations said that the company's N3 fab in Tainan suffered structural damage, with beams and columns broken, leading to an outright halt in production. EUV machines, essential for manufacturing processes below 7nm, have stopped, and research and development labs have been subject to significant damage, such as cracked walls. Another fab in Hsinchu reported broken pipelines and extensive damage to wafers, necessitating a halt in production.<br/>
<br/>
Some of TSMC's high-end chips, such as the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/3nm/">3nm</a> A17 Pro in the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a> and &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; Max, require round-the-clock operations and a stable vacuum environment for several weeks. As a result, some high-end chips already in production are likely to have been spoiled even if they were not damaged directly. <br/>
<br/>
All of the custom silicon processors in Apple's devices are supplied by TSMC. As such, the earthquake's immediate effects on TSMC's facilities have raised concerns about potential delays in Apple's product supply chain. The chipmaker has taken immediate action to assess the damage and initiate recovery procedures, with some production lines expected to resume operation today, but the full extent of the impact on Apple's supply chain remains uncertain.<br/>
<br/>
TSMC has historically placed a strong emphasis on disaster preparedness, especially following a major earthquake in 1999. The company has since implemented rigorous seismic management measures designed to mitigate the risks posed by earthquakes, including post-earthquake inspections, the installation of dampers and shock absorbers, and the integration of equipment vibration reduction technologies.<br/>
<br/>
Apple is in the midst of ramping up production for its upcoming product releases, so significant disruptions in the supply of TSMC-manufactured chips could potentially delay product launches or limit availability. That being said, Apple is known for its robust supply chain management strategies, which will likely help mitigate the immediate effects of the earthquake on the company's product timelines and availability.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tsmc/">TSMC</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/taiwan/">Taiwan</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/03/major-earthquake-in-taiwan/">Major Earthquake in Taiwan Halts Some Apple Chip Production Lines</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/major-earthquake-in-taiwan-halts-some-apple-chip-production-lines.2423436/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The Philips Hue app was today updated to version 5.14, adding support for widgets. Hue widgets can be added to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/home-screen/">Home Screen</a>, Lock Screen, or Today View, and can be used for controlling lights and other accessories.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/04/philips-hue-app-widget.jpg" alt="" width="3084" height="1735" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-944563" /><br/>
<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/home-screen/">Widgets</a> come in small, medium, and large sizes with the largest widget supporting eight actions or scenes. &zwnj;Widgets&zwnj; can be tailored to the entire Hue bridge or to lights that are located in specific rooms, so you can set up a widget for each of your rooms if desired.<br/>
<br/>
Each of the actions can be customized, and you can choose a scene from the Hue app or opt to turn lights in certain rooms on or off. Dimming lights is not an option, nor is activating automations, but some of that can be done through scenes. Adding a widget is a useful way to control frequently accessed lights or scenes.<br/>
<br/>
Along with widgets, the update also improves Friends of Hue switches like the Lutron Aurora Smart Bulb Dimmer Switch. Switches now support time-based light, the scene cycle mode, the natural light scene, and more.<br/>
<br/>
The Philips Hue app can be <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/philips-hue/id1055281310">downloaded from the App Store</a> for free. It is designed to work with <a href="https://www.philips-hue.com/en-us">Philips Hue lights</a> and accessories.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/philips-hue/">Philips Hue</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/02/philips-hue-app-widgets/">Philips Hue App Gains Support for Widgets</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/philips-hue-app-gains-support-for-widgets.2423410/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today introduced a new firmware update for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-max/">AirPods Max</a>. The new firmware is 6A325, up from the 6A324 firmware <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/30/apple-releases-6a324-firmware-for-airpods-max/">released in January</a>.<br/>
<br/>

Apple does not provide details on what features might be included in the refreshed firmware, so it is unclear what's new, and the notes often only list generic bug fixes. <br/>
<br/>
Apple also does not offer instructions on how to upgrade the software on the AirPods, but firmware is generally installed over-the-air while the ‌‌AirPods‌‌ are powered on and connected to an iOS device or a Mac.<br/>
<br/>
You can check your ‌‌‌AirPods‌‌ Max‌‌‌‌‌‌‌ firmware by following these steps:<br/>
<ul><br/>
 	<li>Connect your ‌‌‌‌‌‌AirPods to your iOS device.</li><br/>
 	<li>Open the Settings app.</li><br/>
 	<li>Tap General.</li><br/>
 	<li>Tap About.</li><br/>
 	<li>Tap ‌‌‌‌‌AirPods‌‌‌‌‌.</li><br/>
 	<li>Look at the number next to "Firmware Version."</li><br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today released the first beta of iOS 17.5 to developers, and as expected, the update introduces support for downloading apps from developer websites in the European Union.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-933094" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/Apple-EU-iOS-Changes.jpg" alt="" width="1312" height="738" /><br/>
In iOS 17.4, Apple began allowing developers to offer their apps through alternative app marketplaces in the European Union to comply with the Digital Markets Act. Apple initially intended for apps to only be available through these marketplaces, but in March, Apple said that it would in fact be adding support for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/12/apple-announces-app-downloads-from-websites/">downloading apps directly from websites</a>.<br/>
<br/>
To offer an app for download from a website in the European Union, developers need to meet specific criteria. Developers need to be a member of the Apple Developer Program for two continuous years or more and must have an app with more than one million first installs on iOS in the European Union in the prior year. Other requirements include submitting to Apple's notarization process and publishing transparent data collection policies.<br/>
<br/>
Apple will provide authorized developers with an API that allows them to offer their apps for download via the web. Apps downloaded this way will be able to be backed up, restored, updated, and more.<br/>
<br/>
This is the first time that Apple has sanctioned downloading an app directly from a website. Support for this feature will allow apps like Spotify, Fortnite, and others to be downloaded directly on iPhones should the developers behind those apps opt in to Apple's terms.<br/>
<br/>
Apps offered through the web do not have to pay any commission to Apple, but they are subject to the 0.50 euro Core Technology Fee.<br/>
<br/>
As with alternative app marketplaces, app downloads from the web are available in the European Union only under the terms of the DMA. Note that apps can only be downloaded this way on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> as the changes do not apply to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-17/">iPadOS 17</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-17.241">iOS 17</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-17.242">iPadOS 17</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/02/ios-17-5-app-website-downloads-eu/">iOS 17.5 Lets EU iPhone Users Download Apps From Websites</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-17-5-lets-eu-iphone-users-download-apps-from-websites.2423395/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today seeded the first beta of an upcoming tvOS 17.5 to developers for testing purposes, with the beta coming a month after the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/07/apple-releases-tvos-17-4/">release of tvOS 17.4</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/07/apple-tv-4k-green.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-856182" /><br/>
Registered developers are able to download the tvOS 17.5 update by opting in to the beta through the Settings app on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a>. A registered developer account is required.<br/>
<br/>
tvOS software updates are often minor in scale compared to other operating system updates, focusing primarily on smaller improvements rather than outward-facing changes. We don't yet know what's included in tvOS 17.5.<br/>
<br/>
Apple shares some information on tvOS releases in its <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207936">tvOS support document</a>, which is updated after each tvOS launch, but Apple does not provide notes during beta testing.<br/>
<br/>
Though we don't always know what's new in tvOS betas, we let <em>MacRumors</em> readers know when new updates are available so those who are developers can download new software upon release.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_TV">Apple TV (Caution)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-tv-and-home-theater.100">Apple TV and Home Theater</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/02/apple-seeds-tvos-17-5-beta-1-to-developers/">Apple Seeds First Beta of tvOS 17.5 to Developers</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-seeds-first-beta-of-tvos-17-5-to-developers.2423391/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple is working on a new version of the popular Beats Solo on-ear headphones, and it looks like we are getting closer to a potential launch date. FCC documents for the Beats Solo 4 headphones were found today, and that typically happens in the weeks ahead of a debut. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/new-beats-solo-4.jpg" alt="" width="1129" height="635" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-938522" /><br/>
Signs of the Beats Solo 4 were <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/27/apple-working-on-beats-solo-4-headphones/">first spotted in late February</a>, with images found in the iOS 17.4 beta. The headphones look similar to the Solo 3 headphones, but with some minor design tweaks that bring them in line with the Beats Studio Pro that came out last year. <br/>
<br/>
We are expecting the Beats Solo 4 to come in three colors, including black, pink, and blue. While we don't know the full feature set, we found code that suggests they will support Spatial Audio. <br/>
<br/>
The headphones are likely to adopt some of the changes that were brought to the Beats Studio Pro, including improved sound quality and a USB-C port instead of a micro-USB port. Gesture support will be included, with a press on the "b" button to play/pause and answer calls, a double press to skip songs, and a long press to activate <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a>.<br/>
<br/>
The Beats Solo 3 headphones first came out in 2016, and while there have been new color releases, the line is long overdue for an update. There is no word as of yet when the Solo 4 will come out, but FCC filings usually show up around a month in advance. <div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/beats/">Beats</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/02/apple-beats-solo-4-headphones/">New Beats Solo 4 Headphones Show Up in FCC Database as Launch Approaches</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/new-beats-solo-4-headphones-show-up-in-fcc-database-as-launch-approaches.2423381/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<title>Alleged iOS 18 Design Resource Reveals visionOS-Like Redesign [Updated]</title>

		<category>iOS 18</category>
		

		<description><![CDATA[A first look at iOS 18's rumored visionOS-style redesign may have been revealed by a new image of the Camera app.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/04/iOS-18-Camera-App-Possible-Leak-16x9-1.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-944500" /><em>Alleged iOS 18 design resource.</em></div><br/>
<em>MacRumors</em> received the above iPhone frame template from an anonymous source who claims they obtained it from an iOS engineer. It will allegedly be included as part of the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/design/resources/">Apple Design Resources</a> for iOS 18, which helps developers visually design apps using software like Sketch and Photoshop. We cannot attest to the authenticity of the image, but believe it is worth sharing because it is consistent with previous rumors.<br/>
<br/>
In February, Israeli website <em>The Verifier</em> claimed that iOS 18 and iPadOS 18 will feature <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/09/ios-18-visionos-design-elements-rumor/">visionOS-inspired design elements</a>. The Vision Pro headset's OS features a high level of depth translucency with glass-like buttons that have reflective edges. <br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/visionOS-design.jpeg" alt="" width="1800" height="1012" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-935810" /><em>visionOS design elements.</em></div><br/>
<br/>
For example, the Apple TV app on iPadOS 18 will apparently feature the same translucent navigation bar that was <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/26/apple-tv-app-redesign-tvos-17-2/">introduced in the tvOS 17.2 version of the app</a> last year. The design of this menu has clear similarities to visionOS. Apple also plans to redesign various other system menus and built-in apps on iOS 18, including Safari, according to the report.<br/>
<br/>
<em>The Verifier</em> has a mixed track record with Apple rumors over the years, but <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman subsequently said that Apple is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/25/ios-18-design-changes-rumors/">working to update the design of iOS</a> as "early as this year." He agreed that iOS could take some design cues from visionOS going forward, but Gurman does not expect a "total overhaul that mirrors visionOS." The extent of the potential redesign is therefore still unknown.<br/>
<br/>
While Gurman implied that the redesign may not emerge this year, he was more firm about iOS 18 being redesigned in a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2023-11-12/apple-aapl-plans-ambitious-ios-18-and-macos-15-updates-seeks-to-squash-bugs-lovjlsf6">November edition</a> of his newsletter, when he said Apple's senior management had <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/13/apple-says-ios-18-ambitious-compelling/">described iOS 18 as "ambitious and compelling,"</a> with "major new features and designs."<br/>
<br/>
The purported iOS 18 Camera app design resource seemingly lines up with these reports, showing a substantial rethinking of Apple's visual elements in line with visionOS, but it may not be legitimate. Apple is expected to preview iOS 18 at its annual developers conference WWDC on June 10. The first beta should be available shortly after the announcement. The update should be released to all users in September alongside the iPhone 16 lineup.

The AirPods 2 feature Apple's H1 chip, providing seamless setup for iPhone and other Apple devices. They lack some of the more advanced features of the newer AirPods 3 and updated AirPods Pro 2 with USB-C, but for anyone who just needs a reliable pair of wireless earbuds, they're perfect at this low price.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today announced that Spatial Personas are now available for all Vision Pro users in a public beta.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/04/Spatial-Persona-Apple.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-944483" /><br/>
Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/06/07/vision-pro-spatial-personas/">previewed Spatial Personas</a> at WWDC last year. Unlike the existing Personas feature, which is confined to a tile and facial expressions only, Spatial Personas allow Vision Pro users to "break out of the familiar <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/facetime/">FaceTime</a> tile and feel more present, like they are gathered in the same physical space." They feature a transparent background and are able to show body language and additional movement such as hand gestures for a more lifelike experience.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I tried Spatial Persona on Apple Vision Pro yesterday. I watched a movie trailer with several other Personas in Apple TV, examined a 3D jet turbine in JigSpace, collaborated on a whiteboard in Freemform, and played Hearts in Game Room.<br><br>It was pretty cool!

<br/>
Spatial Personas are independent of a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/visionos/">visionOS</a> software update or beta, but require &zwnj;visionOS&zwnj; 1.1 or later. The feature is available during &zwnj;FaceTime&zwnj; calls and supports up to five participants at once. <em><a href="https://www.inverse.com/tech/spatial-persona-apple-vision-pro">Inverse</a></em> and <a href="https://www.roadtovr.com/apple-vision-pro-spatial-personas-hands-on/"><em>Road to VR</em></a> today shared first impressions of the new feature.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/visionos/">visionOS</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-vision-pro.209">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/02/spatial-personas-beta-coming-to-vision-pro/">Spatial Personas Coming to Apple Vision Pro in Beta Today</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/spatial-personas-coming-to-apple-vision-pro-in-beta-today.2423365/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>
