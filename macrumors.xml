		<description><![CDATA[A security vulnerability that could allow attackers to access sensitive data has been discovered in some Apple silicon GPUs.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/10/a14-bionic-chip-video.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="875" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-764500" /><br/>
A <a href="https://blog.trailofbits.com/2024/01/16/leftoverlocals-listening-to-llm-responses-through-leaked-gpu-local-memory/">recent investigation</a> by cybersecurity firm Trail of Bits discovered the security flaw, named "LeftoverLocals," which allows attackers with local access to a device to retrieve data processed in the GPU's local memory. The issue is particularly concerning because of the expanding use of GPUs in processing Large Language Models (LLMs) for AI applications.<br/>
<br/>
According to the firm, the vulnerability enables an attacker to eavesdrop on another user's interactive LLM session, potentially accessing sensitive information. Apple told <em><a href="https://www.wired.com/story/leftoverlocals-gpu-vulnerability-generative-ai/">Wired</a></em> that newer devices with the A17 Pro and M3 chips have received patches to address this flaw, and Trail of Bits found that the third-generation <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/">iPad Air</a> had also received a fix.<br/>
<br/>
Most older models with vulnerable GPUs, including the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> 12 and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m2/">M2</a> <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/">MacBook Air</a>, are still vulnerable. While Apple has taken steps to patch certain devices, it remains unclear if and when all impacted models will receive security updates to directly address the problem. <br/>
<br/>
The nature of the LeftoverLocals vulnerability is such that it requires physical access to the device, making remote exploitation highly improbable. As always, Apple encourages users to install the latest available software update to ensure they receive security fixes.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-security/">Apple Security</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-silicon/">Apple Silicon</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/17/apple-silicon-security-flaw-discovered/">Apple Silicon Security Flaw Discovered in iPhone 12 and M2 MacBook Air</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-silicon-security-flaw-discovered-in-iphone-12-and-m2-macbook-air.2416595/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Amazon has nearly every model of the Apple Watch Ultra 2 for <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0CHX8Z6W4%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"><strong>&#36;749.00</strong></a> today, down from &#36;799.00. You'll find all band options on sale at this price, including Trail Loop, Ocean Band, and Alpine Loop.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/Apple-Watch-Series-9-and-Ultra-2-Deals-1.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-913209" /><em><small>Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with Amazon. When you click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment, which helps us keep the site running.</small></em><br/>
<br/>
You can find the full list of Apple Watch Ultra 2 models on sale below, with the Alpine Loop and Trail Loop getting the most discounts this time around. Most of the wearables are in stock on Amazon and can be delivered between January 21 and January 22, although a few won't be delivered until later in the month.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0CHX8Z6W4%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"target="_blank"><div class="fancybutton"><div class="fancybadge">&#36;50 OFF</div>Apple Watch Ultra 2 for &#36;749.00</div></a></div><br/>
<br/>
Compared to past sales, this deal is a solid second-best price on the Apple Watch Ultra 2, and it continues to be the best deal we've tracked so far on the watch in 2024. Because we're unlikely to see those record low holiday discounts come back any time soon, we recommend purchasing now if you've been waiting.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[In its press release <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/17/apple-watch-black-unity-band-2024/">unveiling a new Black Unity Sport Band</a> for the Apple Watch, Apple confirmed that iOS 17.3 will be released next week. The software update includes three new features and additions for the iPhone, with more details outlined below.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/12/iOS-17.3-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-926334" /><br/>
Apple's confirmation that iOS 17.3 will be released next week:<blockquote>The new Unity Bloom iPhone and iPad wallpaper for the Lock Screen will be also be available next week, and requires iPhone Xs or later running iOS 17.3 and iPad (6th generation and later), iPad mini (5th generation and later), iPad Air (3rd generation and later), 12.9-inch iPad Pro (2nd generation and later), 10.5-inch iPad Pro, and 11-inch iPad Pro (1st generation and later) running iPadOS 17.3.</blockquote>New features in iOS 17.3 include Stolen Device Protection, collaborative Apple Music playlists, and a Unity Bloom wallpaper for the Lock Screen.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Stolen Device Protection</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/12/ios-stolen-device-protection.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-926120" /><br/>
Earlier this year, <em>The Wall Street Journal</em> reported about <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/19/apple-responds-to-iphone-theft-recovery-key-report/">thieves spying on an iPhone user's passcode</a> before stealing the device, often in public places like bars. With knowledge of the passcode, the thief can then change the victim's Apple ID password, turn off Find My, and more to gain full control of the device. The thief can also use the passcode to gain access to passwords stored in iCloud Keychain and other sensitive information.<br/>
<br/>
Stolen Device Protection is Apple's hopeful solution to the problem. Apple says the feature is designed to add an additional layer of security in the event someone has stolen your iPhone and also obtained the device's passcode.<br/>
<br/>
When the feature is turned on, Face ID or Touch ID authentication is strictly required for the following actions, with a passcode fallback no longer available:<ul><li>Accessing passwords or passkeys saved in iCloud Keychain</li><br/>
<li>Applying for a new Apple Card or viewing an Apple Card's virtual number</li><br/>
<li>Turning off Lost Mode</li><br/>
<li>Erasing all content and settings</li><br/>
<li>Taking certain Apple Cash and Apple Card Savings actions in the Wallet app</li><br/>
<li>Using payment methods saved in Safari</li><br/>
<li>Using your iPhone to set up a new device</li></ul>For especially sensitive actions, including changing the password of the Apple ID account associated with the iPhone, the feature adds a one-hour security delay on top of biometric authentication. In these cases, the user must authenticate with Face ID or Touch ID, wait one hour, and authenticate with Face ID or Touch ID again. However, Apple says there is no delay when the iPhone is in familiar locations, such as at home or work.<br/>
<br/>
Actions that require Face ID or Touch ID authentication, and have a one-hour security delay, when the feature is turned on:<ul><li>Changing your Apple ID password</li><br/>
<li>Updating select Apple ID security settings, including adding or removing a trusted device, trusted phone number, Recovery Key, or Recovery Contact</li><br/>
<li>Changing your iPhone passcode</li><br/>
<li>Adding or removing Face ID or Touch ID</li><br/>
<li>Turning off Find My</li><br/>
<li>Turning off Stolen Device Protection</li></ul>Stolen Device Protection is an opt-in feature that can be found in the Settings app under Face ID & Passcode, and it is available for all iPhones that are compatible with iOS 17.3.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Apple Music Collaborative Playlists</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/apple-music-collaborative-playlist.jpg" alt="" width="2250" height="1266" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-898803" /><br/>
A new Collaborative Playlists option for Apple Music subscribers allows multiple people to add, reorder, and remove songs in a shared playlist. Users are able to leave <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/13/ios-17-3-collaborative-playlist-emoji/">animated emoji reactions</a> next to songs in the playlist.<br/>
<br/>
This feature was <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ios-17-2-beta-features/">initially expected to launch with iOS 17.2</a>, but it was removed from that update towards the end of the beta testing period. The feature was re-added in iOS 17.3, and Apple's website confirmed that it <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/11/apple-music-collaborative-playlists-2024/">would return in 2024</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Unity Bloom Wallpaper</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/Unity-Bloom-Wallpaper-iPhone-iPad.jpg" alt="" width="1960" height="1102" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-931156" /><br/>
iOS 17.3 and iPadOS 17.3 include Apple's new Unity Bloom wallpaper for the iPhone and iPad, in support of the Black community. The wallpaper includes an outline of flowers that fill with color when the display is active.<br/>
<br/>
Apple says the "blooming flowers and vibrant colors represent Pan-Africanism and symbolize generations working together to address injustice and dismantle systemic barriers." There is also a new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/17/apple-watch-black-unity-band-2024/">Black Unity Sport Band for the Apple Watch</a>, and an accompanying Black Unity watch face available with watchOS 10.3, which will also be released next week.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-17/">iPadOS 17</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-17.241">iOS 17</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-17.242">iPadOS 17</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/17/apple-releasing-ios-17-3-next-week/">Apple Releasing iOS 17.3 Next Week With These New Features</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-releasing-ios-17-3-next-week-with-these-new-features.2416586/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

Apple says the band's "blooming flowers and vibrant colors" represent "Pan-Africanism and symbolize generations working together to address injustice and dismantle systemic barriers." The band's pin is etched with "Truth, Power, Solidarity."<br/>
<br/>
An accompanying Black Unity watch face will be available for the Apple Watch with watchOS 10.3, which will be released next week, according to Apple. Users can choose between a single-bloom or full-bloom arrangement for the watch face, and when they raise their wrist, the "flowers begin to bloom with vibrant hues."<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/">iPhone 16 Pro</a> models configured with 1TB of storage could feature slower read and write speeds to reduce costs, <em><a href="https://www.digitimes.com/news/a20240115PD231.html">DigiTimes</a></em> reports.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/iPhone-16-Mock-Header-Updated-1.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-922680" /><br/>
The change is part of Apple's potential switch to higher-density Quad-Level Cell (QLC) NAND flash memory for its 1TB <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> models, which the company is said to currently be "actively evaluating." Apple currently uses costlier Triple-Level Cell (TLC) NAND.<br/>
<br/>
Using QLC NAND would allow Apple to cram more storage into a smaller space and comes at a lower price, but with the disadvantage of slower read and write speeds. QLC NAND can also be less durable and reliable than TLC NAND, handling constant write operations less effectively. Apple could, of course, seek to mitigate these issues with specific optimizations.<br/>
<br/>
The report adds that adopting QLC NAND could make offering iPhones with up to 2TB of storage viable for the first time. A 1TB <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a> Max is priced at &#36;1,599, &#36;200 more than the 512GB model, so a future 2TB model would need to be cost-effective, as well as contain flash storage that is sufficiently compact inside the device.<br/>
<br/>
New &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; models with 128GB, 256GB, and 512GB of storage are highly likely to stick with TLC NAND for the foreseeable future. Although TLC NAND is still widespread in the industry, QLC NAND is expected to account for about 20% of all NAND shipments from the second half of 2023 to the first half of 2024, suggesting that its usage is growing despite its drawbacks.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/">iPhone 16 Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/digitimes-com/">DigiTimes</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/17/1tb-iphone-16-pro-could-face-performance-setback/">1TB iPhone 16 Pro Models Could Face Performance Setback</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/1tb-iphone-16-pro-models-could-face-performance-setback.2416578/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple wants <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/epic-games/">Epic Games</a> to pay &#36;73.4 million in legal fees after Apple won the antitrust case brought against it by the North Carolinian games maker. On Tuesday, the Supreme Court <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/16/supreme-court-declines-to-hear-apple-vs-epic-case/">declined</a> to hear separate requests from both Apple and &zwnj;Epic Games&zwnj; in their long-standing lawsuit against each other regarding <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a> rules, effectively closing a case that has run since <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2020/08/13/apple-removes-fortnite-from-app-store/">August 2020</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/05/app-store-blue-banner-epic-1.jpg" alt="" width="1794" height="1009" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-800065" /><br/>
In multiple rounds of the dispute, Apple has won on every count with the exception of just one regarding Apple's "anti-steering" rule, which the company <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/16/us-app-store-alternative-purchase-option/">promptly addressed on Tuesday</a>. As a result of the Supreme Court's decision, the previous rulings stand and Apple is able to continue to disallow third-party payment processing within apps.<br/>
<br/>
Now though, Apple has asked the court to allow it to bill Epic for its litigation expenses, which amount to a whopping &#36;73,404,326. According to <a href="https://twitter.com/games_fray/status/1747504306532630858"><em>gamesfray</em>'s Florian Mueller</a>, Apple came up with the number by totaling up the &#36;82,971,401 in legal costs it spent on the case, and then adjusted that number down to &#36;81,560,362. Apple then deducted 10% since Epic prevailed on 1 of 10 counts (Apple's anti-steering rule).<br/>
<br/>
Apple bases the claim on Epic's original violation of its developer agreement, when out of the blue its Fortnite game offered an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2020/08/13/fornite-adds-direct-payment-option-on-ios/">in-app payment alternative</a> on the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj;. Epic previously accepted that it would owe damages if it lost its antitrust claims against Apple. Now that it has, Apple has issued the bill.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Apple?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Apple</a> wants <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/EpicGames?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#EpicGames</a> to reimburse &#36;73 MILLION AND COUNTING (the dispute isn&#39;t over yet) in litigation expenses. Apple says it&#39;s spent &#36;82,971,401 defending against that case, adjusts it to &#36;81,560,362, then deducts 10% as Epic prevailed on 1 of 10 counts &#x27a1;&#xfe0f; &#36;73,404,326.<br><br>&#x1f9f5;1/4 <a href="https://t.co/0Qwa3yA6es">pic.twitter.com/0Qwa3yA6es</a></p>&mdash; gamesfray (@games_fray) <a href="https://twitter.com/games_fray/status/1747504304695484810?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 17, 2024</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div><br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Twelve South today announced the launch of <a href="https://www.twelvesouth.com/products/bookarc-flex">the BookArc Flex</a>, a new stand designed for MacBooks that are used in clamshell mode while connected to a display.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/twelve-south-bookarc-flex.jpg" alt="" width="1067" height="600" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-931061" /><br/>
The BookArc Flex has a unique build that features a two legs connected by a flexible interior piece. A laptop is placed in the middle on the flexible part, which pulls the legs together to secure it upright using the weight of the laptop.<br/>
<br/>
Twelve South says that the design <a href="https://www.northcharleston.org/government/projects/noisette-creek-pedestrian-bridge/">was inspired by</a> the Noisette Creek Pedestrian Bridge in Charleston, South Carolina. The bridge has two steel arches that are indeed similar to the design of the BookArc Flex.<br/>
<br/>
We were able to test the BookArc Flex ahead of its launch, and while the design works well, it is important to ensure the laptop goes directly in the center of the stand. It's not difficult to do, and placing the laptop correctly ensures that it remains secure. If it's not placed in the center, however, it can shift out of place, though a misalignment is quickly noticeable.<br/>
<br/>
The construction of the BookArc Flex allows it to work with laptops of multiple sizes without different inserts, and it is compatible with the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/">MacBook Air</a> and MacBook Pro from Apple. The slim size of the BookArc Flex ensures that it does not take up too much room on a desk, and it tucks a MacBook out of the way when used in clamshell mode.<br/>
<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple is making major changes to its U.S. iOS <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a> policies, and developers are now able to direct customers to a non-App Store purchasing option for digital goods. Apple is allowing apps to feature a single link to a developer website that leads to an in-app purchase alternative, but Apple plans to continue to collect a 12 to 27 percent commission on content bought this way.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/01/iOS-App-Store-General-Feature-JoeBlue.jpg" alt="" width="2250" height="1266" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-833073" /><br/>
Apple's update and the backstory that led to it are a bit complicated, but what <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> users need to know is that some apps in the U.S. storefront will soon feature a link to their website where subscriptions and other content can be purchased outside of the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; in-app purchase system, likely with a discounted price.<br/>
<br/>
Developers who want to offer this option will need to apply for a StoreKit External Purchase Link Entitlement, as Apple has outlined in both updated &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; Review Guidelines and the statement of compliance submitted to the Northern California U.S. District Court. With a Link Entitlement, a developer is able to direct a user to an out-of-app purchasing mechanism using an external purchase link. From Apple's modified &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; rules:<br/>
<blockquote>Developers may apply for an entitlement to provide a link in their app to a website the developer owns or maintains responsibility for in order to purchase such items. Learn more about the entitlement. In accordance with the entitlement agreement, the link may inform users about where and how to purchase those in-app purchase items, and the fact that such items may be available for a comparatively lower price. The entitlement is limited to use only in the iOS or iPadOS App Store on the United States storefront. In all other storefronts, apps and their metadata may not include buttons, external links, or other calls to action that direct customers to purchasing mechanisms other than in-app purchase.<br/>
<br/>
If your app engages in misleading marketing practices, scams, or fraud in relation to the entitlement, your app will be removed from the App Store and you may be removed from the Apple Developer Program.</blockquote><br/>
There are several requirements that developers need to adhere to maintain the privacy and security of the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; ecosystem, and notably, Apple will collect a commission on purchases made using these Entitlement Links. Rather than 30 percent, Apple will collect a 27 percent fee on user purchases or year-one subscriptions made through the link. On the second year of a subscription, the commission fee drops to 12 percent, which is three percentage points lower than the 15 percent fee that Apple collects from second-year or longer subscriptions made through the in-app purchase system. Apps that participate in the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; Small Business Program will be charged a 12 percent commission rate.<br/>
<br/>
The commission will apply to transactions for digital goods and services that take place on a developers website within seven days after a user taps through an External Purchase Link to an external website. <br/>
<br/>
Several key points about Entitlement Links are listed below.<br/>
<ul><br/>
 	<li>All links to outside purchasing methods must use the Entitlement Link system, and developers must apply and get Apple's approval.</li><br/>
 	<li>Developers are permitted to have a single plain link on <strong>one</strong> screen of an app. The link can be at a sign-in screen, in user settings, or elsewhere, but it can only be in one place. The single location may not be an interstitial, modal, or pop-up.</li><br/>
 	<li>The link can mention the specific price of content on a website, or that content is discounted on the website from the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; price. Comparisons are allowed.</li><br/>
 	<li>Links cannot be placed directly on an in-app purchase screen or in the in-app purchase flow.</li><br/>
 	<li>Developers need to certify that the third-party payment service provider they are using for out-of-app purchasing meets industry standards for payment processors, and that they will offer users processes for managing subscriptions, requesting refunds, and disputing unauthorized transactions.</li><br/>
 	<li>Apps that participate in Apple's Video Partner Program or News Partner Program are not eligible for Link Entitlement.</li><br/>
 	<li>Apps that use the StoreKit External Purchase Link must continue to offer in-app purchases as an option.</li><br/>
<li>&zwnj;App Store&zwnj; pages are not able to include information about purchasing on a website or a link to a website.</li><br/>
<li>Digital purchases that are sold on an app's website through the Entitlement Link must be available for use in that app.</li><br/>
 	<li>The StoreKit External Purchase Link cannot discourage users from making in-app purchases or mimic an in-app purchase.</li><br/>
 	<li>Links must open a new window in the default browser of the device, and are not able to open a web view.</li><br/>
 	<li>No redirecting, intermediate links, or URL tracking parameters are allowed.</li><br/>
<li>Developers are required to provide a periodic accounting of qualifying out-of-app purchases, and Apple has a right to audit developers' accounting to ensure compliance with their commission obligations and to charge interest and offset payments.</li><br/>
<br/>
</ul><br/>
The Link Entitlement process and the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; changes are applicable only in the U.S. &zwnj;App Store&zwnj;. Apps for all other storefronts are not able to include buttons, external links, or calls to action that direct customers to alternative purchasing options.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/apple-external-link-examples.jpg" alt="" width="1635" height="920" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-931057" /><em><div class="center-wrap">Examples of how Entitlement Links can be used in apps</div></em><br/>
Apple will provide an in-app warning to customers to let them know that they are leaving the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; ecosystem to make a purchase on an external website and that &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; protections will not be available.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/apple-external-app-store-warning.jpg" alt="" width="2030" height="1142" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-931056" /><br/>
According to Apple's statement filed with the court, the requirements surrounding links are aimed at minimizing "fraud, scams, and confusion," while also providing developers with an opportunity to "entice users to other platforms" and give customers a choice between non-App Store purchasing and in-app purchases.<br/>
<br/>
The changes today stem from Apple's 2021 legal battle with <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/epic-games/">Epic Games</a>. Apple won the dispute and the court did not find that Apple had violated U.S. antitrust law, but Apple was at the time ordered to remove "anti-steering" rules preventing developers from informing customers about alternatives to in-app purchases. That order has been on hold <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/07/17/app-store-rule-change-epic-games-delayed/">during the appeals process</a>, but the appeals process ended today.<br/>
<br/>
Both Apple and &zwnj;Epic Games&zwnj; <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/28/apple-epic-appeal-supreme-court/">had appealed</a> to the United States Supreme Court, but the Supreme Court <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/16/supreme-court-declines-to-hear-apple-vs-epic-case/">declined to hear the case</a>. That means the initial ruling and the appeals court ruling that agreed with it are permanent, and Apple now has to comply with the part of that order that required it to change the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; rules.<br/>
<br/>
The anti-steering rule was two-pronged, requiring Apple to allow for links to in-app purchase alternatives and to allow developers to communicate with customers outside of the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; through email and other contact information collected in the app. The outside communication part of the order was already satisfied with a change that Apple made to the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; rules in 2021 to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/26/app-store-changes-developer-lawsuit-settlement/">settle a class-action developer lawsuit</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Apple has already been allowing developers to use communication methods like email to inform customers about payment methods available outside of iOS apps, and Apple makes it clear in its messaging today that there are no limits on developers' out-of-app communications with users.

		<description><![CDATA[Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/16/vision-pro-fcc-approval/">received FCC approval</a> for the Vision Pro today in the U.S., and the filing confirms that the headset does not support Wi-Fi 6E.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/apple-vision-pro-setup.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-923100" /><br/>
Wi-Fi 6E extends the capabilities of the regular Wi-Fi 6 standard to the 6 GHz band, enabling faster wireless speeds and reduced signal interference with a compatible device and router. <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/use-wi-fi-6e-iphone-mac/">Apple devices with Wi-Fi 6E support</a> include the latest iPad Pro models, iPhone 15 Pro models, and most Mac models released in 2023.<br/>
<br/>
The FCC filing shows that the Vision Pro does not have any approved operating frequencies in the 6 GHz range, confirming that the headset lacks Wi-Fi 6E support. Instead, one of Apple's documents in the application confirms that the Vision Pro supports regular Wi-Fi 6, which operates on the 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz frequency bands.<br/>
<br/>
Apple has yet to share full tech specs for the Vision Pro, so only limited details are available. Apple has so far said the headset is equipped with its M2 chip, an all-new R1 chip that processes camera and microphone input, and 256GB of base storage. <em>MacRumors</em> discovered that the headset is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/09/apple-vision-pro-how-much-ram-and-storage/">equipped with 16GB of RAM</a>.<br/>
<br/>
In the U.S., Vision Pro pre-orders begin this Friday, January 19 at 5 a.m. Pacific Time, with pricing starting at &#36;3,499. The headset <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/08/apple-announces-february-2-vision-pro-launch/">launches on Friday, February 2</a>, and Apple previously said that availability would expand to more countries later this year.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Update:</strong> Vision Pro also appears to lack Ultra Wideband support, according to <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2024/01/16/apple-vision-pro-uwb-wifi-6e-7/"><em>9to5Mac</em>'s Zac Hall</a>.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AppleVisionPro">Vision Pro (Don't Buy)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-vision-pro.209">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/16/apple-vision-pro-lacks-wi-fi-6e-support/">Apple Vision Pro Lacks Wi-Fi 6E Support</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-vision-pro-lacks-wi-fi-6e-support.2416525/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple this week invited members of the media to New York City for another round of testing the Vision Pro ahead of its launch, and sites that were able to try out the device are now sharing their impressions.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/Apple-Vision-Pro-Dual-Loop-Band-Purple-Feature-2.jpg" alt="" width="1960" height="1102" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-929938" /><br/>
As a recap, Apple first allowed media to use the Vision Pro following its debut at the Worldwide Developers Conference, but it was still under development at the time and features were limited. Now the headset is nearing release, so testers are able to experience the Vision Pro as consumers will.<br/>
<br/>
<em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-vision-pro-hands-on-redux-immersive-video-disney-app-floating-keyboard-and-a-little-screaming-180006222.html?src=rss">Engadget</a></em>'s Cherlynn Low wore the headset for just 20 minutes with the standard strap and "was in pain" due to the weight of the device. Apple swapped her over to the Dual Loop Band, which "felt much better for weight distribution."<br/>
<br/>
Dana Wollman from <em>Engadget</em> had to experiment with Light Seals in order to get the right fit against the face, and when it was too loose, the headset's lettering did not look sharp. Both testers preferred the Dual Loop version of the band, which was more comfortable, and they said there were a lot of options for fit. Joanna Stern from <em>The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/wsj-com/">Wall Street Journal</a></em> said that the Dual Loop, which she was able to try for the first time, was much more comfortable than the single band option.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Had my 4th demo of the Vision Pro this AM and Apple finally let us take a photo with it on.<br><br>My first three demos (1 in June, 1 in November, 1 in December) were all with the Solo Knit Band and I really felt the weight of the face computer on my face. <br><br>Today I tried the Dual… <a href="https://t.co/DjyYknyme3">pic.twitter.com/DjyYknyme3</a></p>&mdash; Joanna Stern (@JoannaStern) <a href="https://twitter.com/JoannaStern/status/1747331779285991649?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 16, 2024</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div><br/>
<em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24040075/apple-vision-pro-hands-on-virtual-reality">The Verge</a></em>'s Victoria Song didn't comment in detail on the weight, but said that you can feel it sitting on your head "wrecking your hairdo," and that those with long hair can feel it bunch up at the back.<br/>
<br/>
Immersive video was part of the demonstration, which Low said showed impressive levels of texture. Wollman felt immersed in the scene, but "also excluded" because it's lifelike, but no one in the immersive videos "sees you or interacts with you." Disney+ for Vision Pro was described as "like playing a video game" because you can select a Disney-esque background for watching content. Wollman described it as a "Disney-themed drive-in." From Low:<br/>
<blockquote>As a big Marvel fangirl, I really geeked out when the Avengers Tower environment came on. I looked around and saw all kinds of easter eggs, including a takeout container from Shawarma Grill on the table next to me. It feels a little silly to gush about the realism of the images, but I saw no pixels. Instead, I looked at a little handwritten note that Tony Stark had clearly left behind and felt like I was almost able to pick it up. When we switched over to the Tattooine environment, I was placed in the cockpit of Luke Skywalker's landspeeder, and when I reached out to grab the steering controls, I was able to see my own hands in front of me.</blockquote><br/>
Song described the experience of watching spatial videos shot on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>, and she felt "some familiar VR motion queasiness" from the camera shake.<br/>
<br/>
While the floating keyboard has been <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/15/apple-vision-pro-virtual-keyboard-criticism/">described by <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman</a> as a "complete write-off," Low said that it worked "fairly well," while Wollman said that it was "one of the more frustrating" parts of the demo because none of the typing options worked for extended use. Song said it worked, but it was clunky. "You look at a letter and pinch your fingers to select it," she described. <br/>
<br/>
Reviewers were also able to test out the meditation feature and the Encounter Dinosaurs app, and their full thoughts on the device can be read over at <em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-vision-pro-hands-on-redux-immersive-video-disney-app-floating-keyboard-and-a-little-screaming-180006222.html">Engadget</a></em> and <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24040075/apple-vision-pro-hands-on-virtual-reality">The Verge</a></em>. Additional accounts of in-person experiences will be coming out later this week, and Apple is giving some of the media that visit New York this week headsets to test out for full reviews. More in-depth reviews will be available ahead of when the Vision Pro launches on February 2.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AppleVisionPro">Vision Pro (Don't Buy)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-vision-pro.209">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/16/vision-pro-hands-on-pre-launch/">Vision Pro Hands-On: Reviewers Comment on Weight, Disney+ Experience, Virtual Keyboard and More</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/vision-pro-hands-on-reviewers-comment-on-weight-disney-experience-virtual-keyboard-and-more.2416519/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Ahead of the Vision Pro launch that's coming on February 2, Apple has officially debuted the Vision Pro <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a>. With the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; live for the device, apps on the iOS &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; will soon list Vision Pro compatibility.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/visionos-home-screen-mt-hood.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-900011" /><br/>
Developers are now able to release apps for the Vision Pro and have those apps appear in the Vision Pro &zwnj;App Store&zwnj;. Consumers don't yet have access to the Vision Pro headset, but reviewers who have the device on hand will be able to try out third-party apps created for the headset.<br/>
<br/>
The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/visionos/">visionOS</a> &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; will house both apps designed specifically to take advantage of the capabilities of the Vision Pro as well as iOS apps that are able to run on the device in a 2D mode. Existing apps are able to be ported to the Vision Pro with no action needed on the part of the developer, which means that most apps should be available in some capacity. Developers can choose to opt out of having their apps appear, however.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Looks like Apple has just released the visionOS App Store! <a href="https://t.co/zSdiY04JzF">pic.twitter.com/zSdiY04JzF</a></p>&mdash;  (@DylanMcD8) <a href="https://twitter.com/DylanMcD8/status/1747307110847680611?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 16, 2024</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div><br/>
Apple is meeting with select members of the media <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/09/apple-vision-pro-reviews-multiple-meetings/">starting today</a> to provide review units. Reviews are expected to go live at the end of January, so reviewers should have ample time to test out apps.<br/>
<br/>
Pre-orders for the Vision Pro will begin this Friday at 5:00 a.m. Pacific Time, and it is likely that available units will sell out quickly. The headset is set to launch on Friday, February 2, two weeks after when pre-orders happen.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/visionos/">visionOS</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-vision-pro.209">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/16/apple-vision-pro-app-store-launches/">Apple Vision Pro App Store Launches</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-vision-pro-app-store-launches.2416510/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today received FCC approval for the upcoming Vision Pro headset, just days ahead of when pre-orders are set to go live for the device. FCC approval comes a little over two weeks before when the Vision Pro will be in the hands of consumers.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/Vision-Pro-Person.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-913199" /><br/>
It is not unusual for new Apple devices to lack FCC approval until close to their launch date as it can take quite a bit of time for Apple to get products cleared. Apple devices undergo rigorous FCC testing in the United States prior to being able to be sold to the public.<br/>
<br/>
For the last several months, Apple has been required to provide a warning message letting consumers know that the Vision Pro did not yet have FCC approval, but the wording will now be able to be removed from the website, advertising, and other places where it is printed.<br/>
<blockquote>Apple Vision Pro has not been authorized as required by the rules of the Federal Communications Commission. This device is not, and may not be, offered for sale or lease, or sold or leased, until authorization is obtained.</blockquote><br/>
The Vision Pro is set to go up for pre-order on Friday, January 19 at 5:00 a.m. Pacific Time. It is priced starting at &#36;3,500.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AppleVisionPro">Vision Pro (Don't Buy)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-vision-pro.209">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/16/vision-pro-fcc-approval/">Apple Vision Pro Receives FCC Approval Ahead of Launch</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-vision-pro-receives-fcc-approval-ahead-of-launch.2416508/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[In a press release outlining <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/16/vision-pro-streaming-services-and-sports-apps/">entertainment options on the Vision Pro</a>, Apple also briefly highlighted Guest User and Travel Mode features on the headset.<br/>
<br/>

With the Guest User mode, you can let family and friends use your Vision Pro with limited access to certain apps, such as Photos and Safari. Apple says the primary user's Apple ID account settings, Optic ID, passcode, passwords, Apple Pay, Persona, and health data will be restricted while the Guest User mode is active.<br/>
<br/>
Guest User mode was discovered last year <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/06/22/visionos-hands-on/">in the visionOS simulator</a>, part of Apple's app development tool Xcode. Once the mode is turned on, it will automatically shut off if the headset is not worn within five minutes, the simulator showed.<br/>
<br/>

When turned on via Control Center, Apple says Travel Mode stabilizes visuals on the Vision Pro for users wearing the headset on an airplane. Travel Mode was first discovered by <em>MacRumors</em> contributor Steve Moser last year in visionOS beta code, with more details about this  feature <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/06/22/apple-vision-pro-travel-mode/">outlined in our coverage at the time</a>.<br/>
<br/>
In fine print related to Travel Mode, Apple warns that the Vision Pro should obviously not be used while operating a moving vehicle.<br/>
<br/>
Vision Pro can be pre-ordered in the U.S. starting Friday, January 19 at 5 a.m. Pacific Time, and it <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/08/apple-announces-february-2-vision-pro-launch/">launches on Friday, February 2</a>.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/visionos/">visionOS</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AppleVisionPro">Vision Pro (Don't Buy)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-vision-pro.209">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/16/apple-vision-pro-guest-user-and-travel-modes/">Apple Highlights Guest and Travel Modes on Vision Pro</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-highlights-guest-and-travel-modes-on-vision-pro.2416502/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

<br/>
<h2>14-inch MacBook Pro</h2><br/>
Amazon has the 8-Core, 512GB M3 14-inch MacBook Pro for <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0CM5JV268%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1"><strong>&#36;1,399.00</strong></a> in Space Gray, down from &#36;1,599.00. This is a match of the all-time low price on this notebook, and right now it's the only 14-inch model that is at a record low price on Amazon.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0CM5JV268%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1"target="_blank"><div class="fancybutton"><div class="fancybadge">&#36;200 OFF</div>14-inch M3 MacBook Pro (512GB) for &#36;1,399.00</div></a></div><br/>

This is a second-best price on the notebook, and Amazon has it available in Silver and Space Gray.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>16-inch MacBook Pro</h2><br/>
For the larger display, Amazon is discounting a few of the higher-end models to all-time low prices. You can get the 14-Core, 36GB RAM, 1TB M3 Max 16-inch MacBook Pro for <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0CM5MF262%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1"><strong>&#36;3,249.99</strong></a> with an on-page coupon, down from &#36;3,499.00. Thanks to the on-page coupon, this is a new record low price for this model, and it's only available in Space Black.<br/>

<br/>
Lastly, the 16-Core, 48GB RAM, 1TB M3 Max 16-inch MacBook Pro has hit <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0CM5K7BCR%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"><strong>&#36;3,799.00</strong></a> in Silver, down from &#36;3,999.00. This is another best-ever price on the 16-inch MacBook Pro, but stock has been dwindling on the notebook, so if you're interested be sure to place your order soon.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0CM5K7BCR%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"target="_blank"><div class="fancybutton"><div class="fancybadge">&#36;200 OFF</div>16-inch MacBook Pro (48GB RAM, 1TB, M3 Max) for &#36;3,799.00</div></a></div><br/>

		<description><![CDATA[The United States Supreme Court today <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/orders/courtorders/011624zor_e1pf.pdf">declined to hear</a> separate requests from both Apple and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/epic-games/">Epic Games</a> in their long-standing lawsuit against each other with regards to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a> rules. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/05/app-store-blue-banner-epic-1.jpg" alt="" width="1794" height="1009" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-800065" /><br/>
Apple made the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/28/apple-epic-appeal-supreme-court/">request</a> in September 2023, asking the Supreme Court to hear its appeal about the portion of its legal dispute that was ruled in Epic's favor. This was Apple's so-called "anti-steering" rule that bars developers of many iOS apps from directing users to methods of purchase available outside of the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj;, circumventing Apple's revenue cut.<br/>
<br/>
The Supreme Court also declined to hear a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/27/epic-games-supreme-court/">request from Epic Games</a> to make a ruling on the case. The Supreme Court was the last stop for &zwnj;Epic Games&zwnj; after it lost an appeal earlier this year. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in April 2023 <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/24/epic-games-loses-appeal-app-store-battle/">sided with the lower court</a> and ruled that Apple's &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; rules do not violate antitrust law by not allowing for third-party marketplaces.<br/>
<br/>
The dispute between Apple and Epic <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2020/08/13/apple-removes-fortnite-from-app-store/">dates back to 2020</a> with Epic seeking to overturn Apple's &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; rules requiring content purchases within iOS apps to go through Apple, which takes a 15% to 30% cut of the revenue.<br/>
<br/>
In multiple rounds of the dispute, Apple has won on every count with the exception of just one regarding Apple's "anti-steering" rule. In July 2023, a judge ruled that Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/07/17/app-store-rule-change-epic-games-delayed/">did not have to make changes to its policies</a>.<br/>
<br/>
As a result of the Supreme Court's decision today, the previous rulings stand and Apple is able to continue to disallow third-party payment processing within apps, but will have to allow developers to inform users about other purchasing options outside of the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj;.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/lawsuit/">Apple Lawsuits</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/epic-games/">Epic Games</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/epic-games-vs-apple/">Epic Games vs. Apple</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/16/supreme-court-declines-to-hear-apple-vs-epic-case/">US Supreme Court Declines to Hear Apple vs. Epic Games Case</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/us-supreme-court-declines-to-hear-apple-vs-epic-games-case.2416489/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2024/01/apple-previews-new-entertainment-experiences-launching-with-apple-vision-pro/">listed</a> some streaming, video, and sports apps that will be available on the Vision Pro when the headset <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/08/apple-announces-february-2-vision-pro-launch/">launches on February 2</a>, including Disney+, ESPN, MLB, PGA Tour, Max, Discovery+, Amazon Prime Video, Paramount+, Peacock, Pluto TV, Tubi, Fubo, Crunchyroll, Red Bull TV, IMAX, TikTok, and MUBI. Major League Soccer fans can also access MLS Season Pass through the Apple TV app on the headset.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/Disney-Plus-Vision-Pro-1.jpg" alt="" width="1960" height="1102" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-930910" /><br/>
In addition to apps, users will be able to access many other streaming services using Safari and other web browsers on the headset.<br/>
<br/>
Vision Pro supports both 2D and 3D movies. Apple said Disney+ and several other streaming apps will offer select movies in 3D on the Vision Pro at launch, and will debut 3D versions of new movies alongside or shortly after 2D releases.<br/>
<br/>
At launch, more than 150 3D movies will be available to buy or rent through the Apple TV app on the Vision Pro, such as <em>Avatar: The Way of Water</em>, <em>Dune</em>, <em>Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse</em>, and <em>The Super Mario Bros. Movie</em>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/Dune-Vision-Pro.jpg" alt="" width="1960" height="1102" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-930942" /><br/>
In addition, the Apple TV app will offer a <a href="https://www.apple.com/tv-pr/news/2024/01/apple-tv-unveils-groundbreaking-immersive-originals-from-todays-biggest-storytellers-set-to-debut-on-apple-vision-pro/">selection of content</a> recorded in the new Apple Immersive Video format at no additional cost. Apple says the format consists of 180-degree 3D 8K recordings captured with spatial audio. <br/>
<br/>
That immersive content includes:<blockquote>- <strong>Alicia Keys: Rehearsal Room</strong> offers a rare glimpse into the Grammy winner's creative process with this intimate rehearsal session featuring renditions of her hits "No One," "If I Ain't Got You," and "You Don't Know My Name." Users can also access these performances as a special EP exclusively on Apple Music when it debuts.<br/>
<br/>
- <strong>Adventure</strong> follows pioneering athletes as they take on awe-inspiring challenges in some of the world's most sensational locations. In the first episode, Highlining, viewers step into thin air with highliner Faith Dickey as she takes on her biggest challenge yet: a daring traverse 3,000 feet above Norway's breathtaking fjords.<br/>
<br/>
- <strong>Wild Life</strong> takes viewers up close and personal with some of the most charismatic creatures on the planet to uncover what makes them unique, featuring the experts who know them best. The first episode brings viewers into the world's largest rhinoceros sanctuary where a former police captain has dedicated her life to rescuing, raising, and rewilding these gentle giants.<br/>
<br/>
- <strong>Prehistoric Planet Immersive:</strong> The award-winning Apple Original docuseries from Jon Favreau and the producers of Planet Earth returns with an immersive film that transports viewers into the daily lives of dinosaurs, and follows the struggles and triumphs of these majestic animals amid spectacular scenery. Prehistoric Planet Immersive whisks viewers along a rugged ocean coast where a pterosaur colony settles in for an afternoon nap, which proves to be anything but restful.</blockquote>Vision Pro starts at &#36;3,499 in the U.S., and it will be available to pre-order starting this Friday, January 19. The headset is launching in the U.S. only for now, with availability expected to expand to additional countries <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/16/vision-pro-to-launch-internationally-before-wwdc/">later this year</a>.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AppleVisionPro">Vision Pro (Don't Buy)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-vision-pro.209">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/16/vision-pro-streaming-services-and-sports-apps/">Apple Announces Streaming Services and Sports Apps Available on Vision Pro at Launch</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-announces-streaming-services-and-sports-apps-available-on-vision-pro-at-launch.2416486/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<title>Kuo: Apple Vision Pro to Launch Internationally Before WWDC 2024</title>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple is likely to launch its Vision Pro headset outside the United States before WWDC 2024, analyst <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/">Ming-Chi Kuo</a> today reports.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/Apple-Vision-Pro-Dual-Loop-Band-Teal-Feature-2.jpg" alt="" width="1960" height="1102" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-929939" /><br/>
In a new <a href="https://medium.com/@mingchikuo/apple-is-likely-to-release-vision-pro-outside-the-u-s-d8d2ed8f5f01">post on Medium</a>, Kuo said that Apple plans to share new details about <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/visionos/">visionOS</a> with developers from around the globe at its 2024 Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC). To make this push toward global developers worthwhile, Apple needs to make the Vision Pro available in non-U.S. markets before the event. Making the headset available internationally before WWDC would apparently enable Apple to promote a "global development ecosystem" for &zwnj;visionOS&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
Kuo explained that Apple's reasoning for keeping sales of the Vision Pro exclusive to the United States at first is due to limited supply, a wish to ensure that the sales process goes smoothly before expanding it, and to provide time to modify its software to be suitable for other countries. Once these issues have been resolved, Kuo believes the Vision Pro will go on sale in more countries.<br/>
<br/>
Apple has hosted WWDC in early June every year since 2007, so it is highly likely to fall at the same time again this year. Earlier this month, <em>Bloomberg</em>'s <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a> said that the launch of Vision Pro in other countries around the world <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/07/gurman-vision-pro-launch-imminent/">will not "actually be that much later"</a> than its release in the United States. Apple is said to be considering the United Kingdom, Canada, and China as the next markets to receive the product.<br/>
<br/>
It is not clear how much supply will be available in the rest of the world by the time the Vision Pro goes on sale outside the United States. With <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/11/kuo-vision-pro-sellout-likely/">only 80,000 units</a> expected to be available upon launch in the U.S., the headset is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/09/kuo-apple-vision-pro-may-sell-out-fast/">expected to sell out quickly</a> and thereafter be subject to long shipping delays.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/">Ming-Chi Kuo</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AppleVisionPro">Vision Pro (Don't Buy)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-vision-pro.209">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/16/vision-pro-to-launch-internationally-before-wwdc/">Kuo: Apple Vision Pro to Launch Internationally Before WWDC 2024</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/kuo-apple-vision-pro-to-launch-internationally-before-wwdc-2024.2416482/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

But the rest of Apple's Mac lineup is still to be updated to the latest M3 processors.<br/>

Now that 2023 is over, attention naturally turns to the other Macs in the company's lineup and where they fit into Apple's M3 roadmap for the year ahead. Here's what the latest rumors say.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>M3 MacBook Air</h2><br/>
Apple sells three versions of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/">MacBook Air</a>: A cheaper previous-generation 13-inch model with <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m1/">M1</a> chip, and 13-inch and 15-inch models equipped with the newer <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m2/">M2</a> chip. The question is, when will Apple discontinue the &zwnj;M1&zwnj; &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; and replace its top-of-the-line 13-inch and 15-inch machines with M3 equivalents?<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
The existing 15-inch &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; arrived in June 2023, which is not that long ago in terms of Mac update cycles. However, Apple released the &zwnj;M2&zwnj; 13-inch ‌&zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; back in June 2022. It is now the oldest Mac in Apple's current crop, having not been updated in over 550 days.<br/>
<br/>
According to <em>Bloomberg</em>'s <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a>, Apple has new M3 &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; models in development that are scheduled for release in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/06/macbook-air-march-2024/">March this year</a>. In October it was reported that both models had passed <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/16/four-new-macbooks-on-schedule-for-launch-in-2024/">engineering verification testing (EVT)</a>, an early production testing phase on prototype devices. The M3 chip used in the Airs is expected to have similar CPU and GPU core counts as the &zwnj;M2&zwnj; chip in the current models.<br/>
<br/>
According to Gurman, Apple is developing the Macs alongside macOS 14.3, an update that is expected between the end of January and February, but new hardware may ship around the March timeframe. The new ‌&zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj;‌ models could be timed to launch alongside updated <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/">iPad Air</a> models, which are coming around March.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Mac Mini</h2><br/>
Apple announced &zwnj;M2&zwnj; and &zwnj;M2&zwnj; Pro <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-mini/">Mac mini</a> models in January, which at the time of writing is just over 360 days ago, but Apple could be already testing an M3 &zwnj;Mac mini&zwnj;, according to Gurman.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/M3-Mac-Mini-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-920522" /><br/>
<br/>
In August, signs of an unknown "15,12" Mac machine were <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/07/apple-testing-mac-mini-m3/">found in developer code</a>, with the Mac featuring an 8-core CPU (consisting of four efficiency cores and four performance cores), 10-core GPU, and 24GB RAM. Based on the similar specifications to the base &zwnj;M2&zwnj; &zwnj;Mac mini&zwnj; (bar the existing model's 8GB RAM as standard), Gurman believes it represents a next-generation &zwnj;Mac mini&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
Gurman <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/07/23/new-macbook-pro-and-mac-mini-with-m3-2024-launch/">previously said</a> he was not expecting an M3 version of the &zwnj;Mac mini&zwnj; to launch until late 2024, but as it is already in testing, it could potentially be unveiled sooner.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Mac Studio, Mac Pro</h2><br/>
Apple updated the ‌<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-studio/">Mac Studio</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-pro/">Mac Pro</a> with &zwnj;M2&zwnj; series chips in June 2023. &zwnj;Mac Studio&zwnj; models come with either the &zwnj;M2&zwnj; Max or &zwnj;M2&zwnj; Ultra chip, while the &zwnj;Mac Pro&zwnj; has adopted the &zwnj;M2&zwnj; Ultra.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/M3-Mac-Pro-and-Studio-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-920519" /><br/>
<br/>
Both Macs are considered to be in the middle of their product cycles, and Gurman <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/07/apple-working-on-new-mac-studio-and-mac-pro/">believes</a> Apple is working on a new &zwnj;Mac Studio&zwnj; that is likely to launch in the second half of 2024.<br/>
<br/>
The next ‌&zwnj;Mac Studio&zwnj;‌ is likely to be offered with the as-yet-unannounced fourth variant of the M3 chip. Like previous generations, this will double the components of the "Max" version, meaning that it will feature up to 32 CPU cores and 80 GPU cores. Gurman says that Apple is also likely to refresh the &zwnj;Mac Pro&zwnj; with this new high-end chip. <br/>
<br/>
Taiwanese research firm TrendForce claims that Apple will launch a new ‌&zwnj;Mac Studio&zwnj;‌ featuring the M3 Ultra chip at WWDC in June, so we could well see the new &zwnj;Mac Pro&zwnj; alongside of it. <br/>
<br/>
<h2>13-inch MacBook Pro</h2><br/>
Apple has <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/30/apple-discontinues-13-inch-macbook-pro/">discontinued</a> the 13-inch &zwnj;M2&zwnj; MacBook Pro – and along with it the Touch Bar – replacing it with a 14-inch model that's equipped with a next-generation M3 chip. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/No-M3-MacBook-Pro-13-Inch-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-920518" /><br/>
<br/>
Apple says that the 14-inch M3 MacBook Pro is up to 60 percent faster than the 13-inch MacBook Pro with &zwnj;M1&zwnj;. The M3 14-inch MacBook Pro also comes with a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/01/m3-macbook-pro-comparison/">number of other benefits</a> that make it worth the upgrade for anyone with the original 13-inch machine. So do not expect to see an M3-powered 13-inch MacBook Pro anytime soon, if ever.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>M3 Chip Speed and Performance Gains</h2><br/>
The M3 series of chips are built on TSMC's 3-nanometer process, bringing performance and efficiency improvements over Apple's previous &zwnj;M2&zwnj; chips, which are based on the earlier-generation 5-nanometer process. Since its transition to Intel chips, Apple's strategy has been as follows. <br/>
<br/>
In the &zwnj;M1&zwnj; and &zwnj;M2&zwnj; series of Apple silicon, each generation has a baseline version, then a "Pro" chip with more cores for its central processing unit and graphics. Next is an even more powerful "Max" version that doubles the number of graphics cores. Lastly, an "Ultra" model doubles the number of main processing cores and graphics cores found in the "Max." Things are slightly different with the M3 series, as explained below.<br/>
<br/>
In terms of the actual real-world gains, this of course depends on the M3 processor version, coupled with the particular Mac model and other component factors like RAM and thermal dissipation. Nevertheless, all of Apple's M3 chips also boast GPU improvements not found in the &zwnj;M2&zwnj; series, including Dynamic Caching, hardware-accelerated ray tracing, and hardware-accelerated mesh shading.<br/>
<br/>
<h3>M3</h3><br/>
Apple's base M3 chip will likely feature in future &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; models, as well as an updated lower-end version of the &zwnj;Mac mini&zwnj;. At least in the MacBook Airs, the M3 chip is expected to have similar CPU and GPU core counts as the &zwnj;M2&zwnj; chip in the current models, but that could be true for the &zwnj;Mac mini&zwnj; as well.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/M3-Chip-Apple-Event-Slide.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="898" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-920110" /><br/>
Based on Geekbench benchmarks, the M3 chip has single-core and multi-core scores of around 3,000 and 11,700, respectively. The standard &zwnj;M2&zwnj; chip has single-core and multi-core scores of around 2,600 and 9,700, respectively, so the M3 chip is up to 20% faster than the &zwnj;M2&zwnj; chip, which is what Apple claimed during its "Scary Fast" event in October.<br/>
<br/>
<h3>M3 Pro</h3><br/>
Going on what we know from the recently released 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro M3 models, the M3 Pro chip outperforms the ‌&zwnj;M2&zwnj;‌ Pro, but not by a lot. Based on Geekbench benchmarks, single-core speed is up around 16.7 percent, while multi-core speed is up approximately 6.7 percent. For context, the M3 Pro has 150GB/s memory bandwidth, while the &zwnj;M2&zwnj; Pro had 200GB/s. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/m3-pro-chip.jpg" alt="" width="5104" height="2868" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-919649" /><br/>
<br/>
The M3 Pro and &zwnj;M2&zwnj; Pro chips in the 16-inch MacBook Pro have 12 CPU cores, but the &zwnj;M2&zwnj; Pro actually featured one additional GPU core over the M3 Pro. Despite that, Apple claims it is 10 percent faster than the &zwnj;M2&zwnj; Pro GPU and 40 percent faster than the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m1-pro/">M1 Pro</a> GPU. <br/>
<br/>
<h3>M3 Max</h3><br/>
With the M3 series, Apple deviated slightly from the doubling strategy it followed with the &zwnj;M2&zwnj; Max by adding several more CPU cores to the M3 Max compared to the M3 Pro. Benchmarks indicate that Apple's M3 Max chip in the 16-inch MacBook Pro is around as fast as the &zwnj;M2&zwnj; Ultra chip used in the current-generation &zwnj;Mac Pro&zwnj; and the higher-end &zwnj;Mac Studio&zwnj;. In other words, the &zwnj;M2&zwnj; Ultra &zwnj;Mac Pro&zwnj; is outperformed by what is on paper a lower-end machine, just four months after it was released.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/M3-Max-Chip.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="895" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-920348" /><br/>
Note that the M3-powered 16-inch MacBook Pro starts at &#36;3,499 in the U.S. when configured with the M3 Max chip, while the &zwnj;Mac Studio&zwnj; with the &zwnj;M2&zwnj; Ultra chip starts at &#36;3,999, so you can effectively get the same performance for &#36;500 less by buying a 16-inch MacBook Pro, which also includes display, keyboard, and trackpad. <br/>
<br/>
Will this performance imbalance alone encourage Apple to bring forward the launch of M3-powered &zwnj;Mac Studio&zwnj; and &zwnj;Mac Pro&zwnj; models? Unlikely. But we can always hope. <br/>
<br/>
<h3>M3 Ultra</h3><br/>
Having not yet been announced, the M3 Ultra chip is something of an unknown quantity. The existing &zwnj;M2&zwnj; Ultra encompasses two &zwnj;M2&zwnj; Max chips for double overall CPU and GPU performance, as well as twice the memory bandwidth (800GB/s), so it would seem safe to expect Apple to follow the same strategy as it did with the M3 Ultra, with similar performance gains over the M3 Max from Apple's next-generation high-end M3 Ultra chip.<br/>
<br/>
In a small deviation, Apple did add several more CPU cores to the M3 Max compared to the M3 Pro. However, if Apple continues to double both the CPU and graphics configurations with the Ultra, the M3 Ultra could end up having 32 CPU cores and 80 graphics cores. <div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m3/">M3</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/16/here-are-all-the-new-m3-apple-macs-expected-in-2024/">Here Are All the New M3 Apple Macs Expected This Year</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/here-are-all-the-new-m3-apple-macs-expected-this-year.2416465/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>
