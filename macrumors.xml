		<description><![CDATA[Scosche at CES <a href="https://www.scosche.com/ces-2024">is showing off</a> a new version of its BaseLynx 2.0 Modular Charging System, with the updated model offering support for the new Qi2 wireless charging standard.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/scoche-baselynx-qi2.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="562" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-929904" /><br/>
A <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe-battery-pack/">MagSafe</a> version of the BaseLynx 2.0 <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/01/04/scosche-baselynx-charging-system/">launched in Apple retail stores</a> earlier this year, but the new model will be available directly from Scosche as of this spring.<br/>
<br/>
The BaseLynx is a multi-component charging system with modules that include a 2-in-1 Qi2 charger that works with the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> and AirPods, an Apple Watch Stand with fast charging support, a multi-device vertical charging station that provides 60W for up to three devices, and an end cap with an AC outlet and 67W USB-C port. The Qi2 wireless charging base is able to charge an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; at up to 15W, the same as &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
With all of the BaseLynx components, the setup can charge an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;, AirPods, Apple Watch, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>, MacBook, and more all at one time in one organized spot on a desktop.<br/>
<br/>
Alongside the BaseLynx 2.0, <a href="https://www.scosche.com/ces-2024">Scosche also introduced</a> the PowerVolt 150W USB-C Desk Charger With 4 USB-C ports, the PowerVolt 30W USB-C Home Charger, and the PowerVolt 40W USB-C Car Adapter able to provide 20W per USB-C port.<br/>
<br/>
Scosche's products are set to launch later this year.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/scosche/">Scosche</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ces-2024/">CES 2024</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/10/ces-2024-baselynx-qi2-charger/">CES 2024: Scosche Shares Qi2 BaseLynx Modular Charging System</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ces-2024-scosche-shares-qi2-baselynx-modular-charging-system.2416004/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today seeded the third public beta of an upcoming <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sonoma/">macOS Sonoma</a> 14.3 update, allowing non-developers to test out the software ahead of its release. The third public beta comes a week after <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/04/apple-releases-macos-sonoma-14-3-public-beta-2/">the second public beta</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-900182" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/macos-sonoma-4.jpg" alt="" width="2336" height="1314" /><br/>
Beta testers can opt-in through the Software Update section of the System Settings app. Under Beta updates, simply toggle on the Sonoma Public Beta. Note that you must sign up to participate on Apple's <a href="https://beta.apple.com">beta testing website</a>.<br/>
<br/>
&zwnj;macOS Sonoma&zwnj; 14.3 includes support for collaborative playlists in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/">Apple Music</a>, allowing &zwnj;Apple Music&zwnj; subscribers to build playlists with others. When creating a new playlist or selecting an existing playlist, there's a person-shaped icon that can be tapped to turn on collaboration.<br/>
<br/>
Enabling collaboration provides a link that can be shared with others, and anyone with the link is able to contribute to the playlist and listen to the songs. The person who started the playlist can choose to approve those who want to join or open it up to everyone. Anyone with the link to a playlist can add music, though the owner can turn off collaboration at any time or remove people.<br/>
<br/>
&zwnj;macOS Sonoma&zwnj; 14.3 is expected to see a launch later in January.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sonoma/">macOS Sonoma</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macos-sonoma.243">macOS Sonoma</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/10/apple-seeds-macos-sonoma-14-3-public-beta-3/">Apple Seeds Third Public Beta of macOS Sonoma 14.3</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-seeds-third-public-beta-of-macos-sonoma-14-3.2415992/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today seeded the third betas of upcoming iOS 17.3 and iPadOS 17.3 updates to public beta testers, allowing non-developers to test the software ahead of its release. The second public iOS 17.3 and iPadOS 17.3 betas come almost a month after Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/14/apple-seeds-ios-17-3-public-beta-1/">released the first betas</a>. Note that while Apple is calling these the third betas of iOS 17.3 and iPadOS 17.3, there was technically never a second public beta. Apple had to pull the second developer betas of iOS 17.3 and iPadOS 17.3, and opted to go straight to the third beta rather than releasing an updated public beta version.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-926334" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/12/iOS-17.3-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" /><br/>
Public beta testers can get the beta by opening up the Settings app, going to the Software Update section, tapping on the "Beta Updates" option, and toggling on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a> or <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-17/">iPadOS 17</a> Public Beta. Signing up on Apple's beta testing website is required.<br/>
<br/>
iOS 17.3 <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/12/ios-17-3-stolen-device-protection-feature/">includes Stolen Device Protection</a>, a feature that offers an extra layer of security in case your <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> is stolen and the thief also obtains your passcode. With this turned on, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mask-face-id/">Face ID</a> or <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/touch-id/">Touch ID</a> authentication is required for viewing <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/icloud/">iCloud</a> Keychain passwords, turning off Lost Mode, erasing an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;'s contents, using saved payment methods in Safari, and more. There is no passcode entry option should &zwnj;Face ID&zwnj; or &zwnj;Touch ID&zwnj; fail.<br/>
<br/>
Certain actions, such as changing an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-id/">Apple ID</a> password, updating a device passcode, turning off <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/find-my-network-accessory-program/">Find My</a>, and removing &zwnj;Face ID&zwnj; require authentication and also a one-hour security delay.<br/>
<br/>
The update also adds <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/12/ios-17-3-beta-apple-music-collaborative-playlists/">collaborative Apple Music playlists</a>, a feature that lets <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/">Apple Music</a> subscribers build playlists with friends, family members, and others who share their musical tastes. Any playlist can be turned into a collaborative playlist by tapping on the person-shaped icon and sharing the link.<br/>
<br/>
Those who want to try it out in iOS 17.3 can click on <a href="https://music.apple.com/us/playlist/pl.u-kaJH7JG97e?a=join&amp;it=zr6IZVEGZ6tVoblq">the MacRumors playlist link</a> to try adding a song.<br/>
<br/>
We are expecting iOS 17.3 and iPadOS 17.3 to be released sometime in January.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/10/apple-seeds-ios-17-3-public-beta-3/">Apple Seeds Third Public Beta of iOS 17.3 With Stolen Device Protection</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-seeds-third-public-beta-of-ios-17-3-with-stolen-device-protection.2415990/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Images purporting to reveal the original version of Apple's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe-battery-pack/">MagSafe</a> charger today surfaced online, providing a look at how the company conceived of the accessory over two and a half years before its release.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/magsafe-charger-original-prototype.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-929921" /><br/>
The images, shared by the Apple leaker and prototype collector known as "<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/kosutami/">Kosutami</a>," claim to show the original version of the &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; charger that Apple considered launching. The prototype has a production date of March 2017, a key period in the development of Apple's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airpower/">AirPower</a> wireless charging mat. This version of &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; was apparently developed directly alongside &zwnj;AirPower&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
The earlier version of &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> features a rubberized outer shell that feels similar to the base of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod/">HomePod</a>, rounded edges, a different array of magnets with opposite magnetism, and a large Apple logo. It is apparently the same approximate size as the final version, but noticeably thinner. The design language distinctively harks back to an earlier period in Apple's history that more generously used white rubberized plastics and featured its logo more prominently.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Following the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2019/03/29/apple-officially-cancels-airpower/">cancelation of AirPower</a> in March 2019, Apple apparently revisited this earlier &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; concept and rebooted the project. It ultimately launched with the design we know today alongside the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 12 in October 2020, seeming to taking direct inspiration from the Apple Watch's charger with a thicker silver aluminum outer shell, flat sides, and no Apple logo.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Google Maps continues to work on integrating Live Activities support for iPhones, according to new assets unearthed by <em>MacRumors</em> contributor Aaron Perris in the latest version of the app.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/02/iphone-14-pro-max-deep-purple-feature-purple.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-886218" /><br/>
Evidence that the feature was in development first appeared in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/28/google-maps-preparing-live-activities/">August</a>, but further work on it had appeared to have come to a standstill until now, suggesting it could become functional soon. <br/>
<br/>
The Google Maps team announced in February 2023 that it would roll out Live Activities support "in the coming months," so support is now long overdue based on the company's own internal roadmap.<br/>
<br/>
When support rolls out, Google Maps users will be able to view turn-by-turn directions and their ETA in a single live-updating <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> Lock Screen notification, as well as in the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/dynamic-island/">Dynamic Island</a> on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-14/">iPhone 14</a> Pro and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a> series models.<br/>
<br/>
Apple opened up its Live Activities API to third-party &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; apps with the release of iOS 16.1, and many developers have <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/live-activities/">since made good use of the feature</a>. <div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/google-maps/">Google Maps</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/live-activities/">Live Activities</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/10/google-maps-live-activities-support-continues/">Google Maps Still Working On Long-Overdue Live Activities Support</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/google-maps-still-working-on-long-overdue-live-activities-support.2415972/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[<a href="https://www.ugreen.com">Ugreen</a>, best known for its charging solutions and accessories, has announced a new partnership with Intel to bring its next-generation NASync series of network attached storage devices to the U.S. market later this year.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/ugreen-nas.jpg" alt="" width="5000" height="2900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-929911" /><br/>
Designed for home or business users, NASync devices use Intel Core i5 control chips to power an AI-driven intelligent data management center where users can store and access data locally and remotely via smartphones, laptops, tablets, and TVs. An all-in-one app facilitates wireless data access for streaming media, and also includes photo recognition for searching pictures by text.<br/>
<br/>
The NASync series come in 2-bay and 4-bay models for home use, and 6-bay and 8-bay models for business, offering up to 184TB of storage capacity and up to 32GB of DDR5 memory. Drive installation is also made easier thanks to what Ugreen calls a unique manual push-pull mechanism, so no additional tools are required.<br/>
<br/>
In addition to the SATA drive bays, all the NASync devices in the range include at least two M.2 SSD drive slots for installing solid-state drives, which can be used for extra storage or as a fast caching space for speeding up read/write performance.<br/>
<br/>
Each NAS is equipped with dual Thunderbolt 4 Ports, an SD slot, USB-A ports and Type-C ports, and HDMI for up to 8K output, allowing NASync to be connected to various storage devices such as SD cards, mobile hard disks, USB flash drives, and disk array cabinets for data back-up and synchronization. In addition, the NASync Series is also equipped with a PCIe 4.0 X4 expansion slot and dual 10GB Ethernet ports that can be aggregated into a 20GB bandwidth, offering up to 2,500MB/s download speeds. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/ugreen-nasync.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-929914" /><br/>
Ugreen is also launching an "all-flash" compact model for creative and media professionals that features four M.2 SSD drive slots, an 8K HDMI port, and a built-in Wi-Fi chip.<br/>
<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple has <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/08/apple-announces-february-2-vision-pro-launch/">announced</a> the launch date of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a>, its much-touted spatial computing device. The mixed reality headset starts at &#36;3,499 and will go on sale in the U.S. on Friday, February 2, with availability in Canada and the United Kingdom expected to follow later this year.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/Apple-Vision-Pro-Dual-Loop-Band.jpeg" alt="" width="1640" height="1060" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-929483" /><br/>
Apple has not yet revealed all the details about the device's configuration options ahead of pre-orders, which start on Friday, January 19, but we do know what is included in the box with every &zwnj;Apple Vision Pro&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
<ul><br/>
    <li><strong>Vision Pro Headset</strong>: The headset is the primary component of the Vision Pro system, featuring advanced eye and hand-tracking technology via cameras, ultra high-resolution displays for each eye, speakers on either side, and an EyeSight front-facing screen. The headset comes with a minimum of 256GB of onboard storage for applications and media.</li><br/>
    <li><strong>Solo Knit Band and Dual Loop Band</strong>: These two types of headband are designed for user comfort and customization. The Solo Knit Band is a single band that wraps around the back of the head, while Apple says the Dual Loop Band features "a pair of adjustable upper and lower straps for a personalized fit."</li><br/>
    <li><strong>Light Seal</strong>: The Light Seal is made of a soft textile and likely comes in a range of shapes and sizes, flexing to conform to the user's face for a precise fit. This accessory helps to block external light, enhancing the immersive experience of the headset.</li><br/>
    <li><strong>Two Light Seal Cushions</strong>: These cushions come supplied in two sizes and provide additional comfort and light-blocking capability, ensuring a snug fit around the face to prevent light leakage.</li><br/>
    <li><strong>Cover for Front Glass</strong>: The cover protects the headset's front glass when not in use, preventing scratches and damage.</li><br/>
    <li><strong>Polishing Cloth</strong>: A soft cloth designed for cleaning the headset's lenses and front glass without causing scratches or damage.</li><br/>
    <li><strong>Battery Pack</strong>: An external power source for the headset, ensuring longer usage times and portability. The battery provides 2 hours of general use and 2.5 hours of 2D video playback on a single charge, according to Apple.</li><br/>
    <li><strong>USB-C Power Adapter</strong>: The adapter is used to charge the headset's battery pack, ensuring the device is always ready for use. It also may enable the Vision Pro to be connected to an external power source for longer periods of use than the portable battery allows, although Apple has yet to confirm this.</li><br/>
    <li><strong>USB-C Charging Cable</strong>: A cable for connecting the headset or the battery pack to the USB-C power adapter for charging.</li><br/>
</ul><br/>
<br/>
Apple will offer optional optical inserts for users who normally wear glasses, but these are not included in the packaging and will be a separate purchase starting at &#36;99. Apple is partnering with ZEISS to offer the inserts that can be customized to each person's vision requirements. <br/>
<br/>
The inserts attach to the Vision Pro lenses magnetically, allowing for precise viewing and eye tracking. Glasses wearers will need a valid prescription to get the inserts, but Apple cautions that not all prescriptions will be supported. Optical inserts will be available to order online on Apple's website.<br/>
<br/>
Apple plans to start offering Vision Pro demonstrations at U.S. Apple retail stores on launch day. Apple says that demo times will be offered through the weekend on a first-come, first-served basis, with signups to take place starting at 8:00 a.m. on February 2.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[<a href="https://www.otterbox.com/">OtterBox</a>, known for its range of protective cases designed for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>, today announced the launch of new cases that are made from cactus leather. According to OtterBox, the cases are designed to feel like leather, but are created from the more sustainable and ethical cactus material.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/otterbox-cactus-leather-case.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-929892" /><br/>
The soft-touch Symmetry Series Cactus Leather Cases offer the case protection that is typical of an OtterBox accessory. There's a rigid case design with reinforced corners for shock absorption, a raised edge to keep the camera safe, a screen lip to protect the display, and DROP+ protection.<br/>
<br/>
The cactus leather is sourced from the nopal cactus, which is more commonly known as the prickly pear. Producing cactus leather requires less land, water, and resources than producing traditional leather, and when mature prickly pear pads are gathered, the rest of the cactus remains alive and healthy for re-harvesting again in the future.<br/>
<br/>
<em>MacRumors</em> videographer Dan Barbera was able to see OtterBox's cases in person at CES, and he found the material to be an improvement over Apple's leather alternative, FineWoven.<br/>
<br/>
OtterBox is offering the cases alongside cactus leather Apple Watch band options and a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe-battery-pack/">MagSafe</a> wallet made from the same material.<br/>
<br/>
The first cactus leather cases will be priced at &#36;60 and will be <a href="https://www.otterbox.com/">available from the OtterBox website</a> starting in Spring 2024.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/otterbox/">OtterBox</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ces-2024/">CES 2024</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/09/ces-2024-otterbox/">CES 2024: OtterBox Launches New Cases Made From Sustainable Cactus Leather</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ces-2024-otterbox-launches-new-cases-made-from-sustainable-cactus-leather.2415926/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[AI startup Rabbit today announced the launch of <a href="https://www.rabbit.tech">the Rabbit r1</a>, a mobile device that's designed to simplify the experience of using a smartphone. The r1 runs rabbit OS, an operating system powered by a Large Action Model (LAM).<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/rabbit-r1.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-929901" /><br/>
The Large Action Model is able to learn how humans use computers, or more specifically, how r1 users take advantage of apps. Rabbit says that the r1 can understand complex user intentions, operate user interfaces, and perform actions on behalf of the user. The OS was trained on data from people interacting with apps, allowing the r1 to do tasks like ordering pizza, booking ride services, playing music, communicating with people, and more, through voice commands.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Introducing r1. Watch the keynote. <br><br>Order now: <a href="https://t.co/R3sOtVWoJ5">https://t.co/R3sOtVWoJ5</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/CES2024?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#CES2024</a> <a href="https://t.co/niUmjFvKvE">pic.twitter.com/niUmjFvKvE</a></p>&mdash; rabbit inc.

The Rabbit r1 can be interacted with using a push-to-talk button on the side, and it understands natural language requests. There are no apps on the r1, and tasks are performed over the internet.<br/>
<br/>
Designed in partnership with Teenage Engineering, the r1 has a 2.88-inch touch screen, a camera that rotates for capturing photos and videos and taking video calls, a scroll wheel for navigation purposes, and a USB-C port for charging. There is a 1,000mAh battery, and battery life depends on usage. While there is no subscription associated with the Rabbit r1, it does need a SIM card for cellular data.<br/>
<br/>
Users can teach the r1 to perform tasks, including multi-step tasks such as researching a location, booking a hotel, securing restaurant recommendations, and finding activities. Once the r1 has learned a task, it can repeat the action independently. It supposedly can even interact with apps like Photoshop, performing multi-step actions within the software.<br/>
<br/>
The Rabbit r1 needs to be provided with a user's logins for various services in order to complete tasks involving those services. <br/>
<br/>
The Rabbit r1 can be <a href="https://www.rabbit.tech">pre-ordered from the Rabbit website</a> for &#36;200.

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today seeded the third beta of an upcoming tvOS 17.3 update to developers for testing purposes, with the beta coming a week after the release of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/03/apple-seeds-tvos-17-3-beta-2-to-developers/">second tvOS 17.3 beta</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-869857" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/10/Apple-TV-2022-Feature-Blue.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" /><br/>
Registered developers are able to download the tvOS 17.3 update by opting in to the beta through the Settings app on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a>. A registered developer account is required.<br/>
<br/>
tvOS updates are often minor in scale compared to other operating system updates, focusing primarily on bug fixes and smaller improvements rather than notable outward-facing changes. We don't yet know what's included in tvOS 17.3.<br/>
<br/>
Apple shares some information on tvOS releases in its <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207936">tvOS support document</a>, which is updated after each tvOS launch, but Apple does not provide notes during beta testing.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[CES is underway in Las Vegas, and while it's been overshadowed by Apple's Vision Pro launch date announcement, there are still plenty of interesting new products to look at. <em>MacRumors</em> videographer Dan Barbera is at CES to bring us an overview of what's worth checking out.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TfqEDPHjK5Y" title="CES 2024 Day 2: LG Transparent OLED, Facial Recognition Lock &amp; More!" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe><em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/macrumors?sub_confirmation=1">Subscribe to the MacRumors YouTube channel</a> for more videos.</em></div><br/>
Day 2 at CES was actually Monday, the day before the show "officially" kicks off and the show floor opens. Vendors were on hand showcasing products in private suites, and the annual Pepcom show took place.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/08/ces-2024-day-1-recap/">Like Samsung</a>, LG was showing off transparent display technology with the LG Signature OLED T (T for transparent). LG's OLED TV is coming out later this year, and it can transition between transparency and an opaque background for television watching. LG has designed content specifically for the see-through background, and some of it has an almost hologram-like look.<br/>
<br/>
Lockly was showing off a HomeKit-compatible smart lock that uses facial recognition to open the door, while Ember brought its cup warming technology to baby bottles. Aqara showed off an indoor lock with fingerprint detection, and Scosche was on hand to demo the BaseLynx 2.0, its modular charging system for Apple devices.<br/>
<br/>
OtterBox has a new environmentally friendly <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> case made of cactus leather, Orbi showed off a new Wi-Fi 7 mesh router setup, and GE had an indoor smokeless smoker that uses pellets.<br/>
<br/>
Dan will be wandering the show floor on Tuesday, so make sure to stay tuned to see tomorrow's CES roundup video. We're also covering all kinds of announcements from CES, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ces-2024/">which you can check out at our CES 2024 hub</a>.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ces-2024/">CES 2024</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/09/ces-2024-day-2-recap/">CES 2024 Day 2: Transparent TVs From LG, OtterBox&#039;s Cactus Leather, Lockly Smart Locks and More</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ces-2024-day-2-transparent-tvs-from-lg-otterboxs-cactus-leather-lockly-smart-locks-and-more.2415910/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Today marks the 17th anniversary of the late Steve Jobs <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnrJzXM7a6o">unveiling the original iPhone</a> at the Macworld Expo in San Francisco. While the device was significantly more advanced than any other smartphone on the market at the time, the iPhone was still missing some essential features that we take for granted today.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/2007-iPhone.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="675" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-929882" /><br/>
Below, we've put together a list of 10 hardware and software features that the original iPhone didn't have when it was introduced in January 2007.<br/>
<br/>
<ul><li><strong>Copy and Paste:</strong> It may seem hard to believe, but the ability to copy and paste text was not added to the iPhone until 2009.</li><br/>
<li><strong>Front Camera:</strong> While selfies are now ubiquitous, there was no front camera on the original iPhone. In fact, there was no front camera until the iPhone 4 launched in 2010 with new FaceTime video calling.</li><br/>
<li><strong>App Store:</strong> The original iPhone came with preinstalled apps like Phone, Weather, Notes, Calendar, Photos, and Calculator, but there was no official way to install native third-party apps until the App Store launched in July 2008. Developers were able to offer web-based apps, but they were more limited.</li><br/>
<li><strong>Video Recording:</strong> The original iPhone can only shoot photos, with video recording introduced on the iPhone 3GS in 2009.</li><br/>
<li><strong>Flashlight:</strong> With no LED flash on the original iPhone, there was no built-in flashlight. When the App Store launched, some flashlight apps were released that displayed a white screen at max brightness to mimic a flashlight.</li><br/>
<li><strong>Photo Messages:</strong> The original iPhone supported text messaging via SMS, but there was no ability to send photos. MMS capabilities were introduced with iPhone OS 3.0 in 2009, but only for the iPhone 3G and iPhone 3GS.<br/>
<li><strong>GPS:</strong> While the original iPhone came with a Google Maps app preinstalled, there were no turn-by-turn directions, as the device did not have a GPS. Apple introduced a built-in GPS with the iPhone 3G in 2008.</li><br/>
<li><strong>Home Screen Wallpapers:</strong> It was not possible to set a custom Home Screen wallpaper on the iPhone until iOS 4 was released in 2010, and the software update did not support the original iPhone.</li><br/>
<li><strong>Retina Display:</strong> Introduced on the iPhone 4 in 2010, the Retina display featured four times as many pixels as the original iPhone and was the highest-resolution display for a smartphone ever at the time.</li><br/>
<li><strong>3G:</strong> The original iPhone's cellular connectivity was limited to EDGE (2G).</li></ul><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/09/original-iphone-missing-features/">iPhone Was Missing These 10 Essential Features When Unveiled in 2007</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-was-missing-these-10-essential-features-when-unveiled-in-2007.2415906/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<title>When to Expect the AirTag 2 to Launch</title>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple released its <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-airtag/airtag">AirTag</a> item tracker in April 2021. The accessory has not received any hardware updates since, but there have been rumors about a new model.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/07/airtag-purple.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-903337" /><br/>
Below, we recap rumors about when the second-generation AirTag might be released, as well as potential new features to expect.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Timing</h2><br/>
Apple supply chain analyst Ming-Chi Kuo and <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman both expect the next AirTag to be released in 2025.<br/>
<br/>
In October 2023, Kuo said mass production of the second-generation AirTag had been postponed from the fourth quarter of 2024 <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/18/airtag-2-postponed-until-2025/">until some point in 2025</a>, but he did not provide a reason for the apparent change in plans.<br/>
<br/>
Gurman echoed this revised timeframe <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-01-07/apple-2024-plans-challenges-gen-ai-vision-pro-china-sales-app-store-changes-lr3k9p8p">in his <em>Power On</em> newsletter</a> last Sunday.<br/>
<br/>
"Apple considered launching its second-generation AirTags in 2024, but I'm now told new versions aren't likely to hit the market until 2025," he wrote.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Features</h2><br/>
Kuo believes the new AirTag will have some kind of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/02/kuo-new-airtag-production-late-2024/">integration with Apple's upcoming Vision Pro headset</a>, but he has not shared any specific details.<br/>
<br/>
Gurman expects the new AirTag to feature an upgraded wireless chip, but he did not elaborate on what this would mean. It is possible that the AirTag could be updated with the second-generation Ultra Wideband chip that debuted in all iPhone 15 models last year, which would pave the way for improved location accuracy for item tracking.<br/>
<br/>
No design or price changes have been rumored so far. Read our <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airtags-2/">AirTag 2 guide</a> for more details.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airtag/">AirTag</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/09/airtag-2-release-date-and-features/">When to Expect the AirTag 2 to Launch</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/when-to-expect-the-airtag-2-to-launch.2415902/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today seeded the third betas of upcoming iOS 17.3 and iPadOS 17.3 updates to developers for testing purposes, with the updates available a week after the release of the first <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/03/apple-seeds-ios-17-3-beta-2-to-developers/">iOS 17.3 and iPadOS 17.3 betas</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-926334" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/12/iOS-17.3-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" /><br/>
Registered developers are able to opt into the betas by opening up the Settings app, going to the Software Update section, tapping on the "Beta Updates" option, and toggling on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a> or <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-17/">iPadOS 17</a> Developer Beta. An <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-id/">Apple ID</a> associated with a developer account is required to download and install the beta.<br/>
<br/>
iOS 17.3 introduces a Stolen Device Protection feature that limits access to your private information in case someone obtains both your <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> and your passcode. When activated, it requires <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mask-face-id/">Face ID</a> or <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/touch-id/">Touch ID</a> identity verification to do things like accessing passwords in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/icloud/">iCloud</a> Keychain, turning off Lost Mode, making purchases through Safari with saved payment credentials, and more.<br/>
<br/>
There are also features that require verification <em>and</em> have a one-hour delay to access, such as changing an &zwnj;Apple ID&zwnj; passcode, an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; passcode, turning off <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/find-my-network-accessory-program/">Find My</a>, and turning off &zwnj;Face ID&zwnj;. More details can be <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/12/ios-17-3-stolen-device-protection-feature/">found in our article on Stolen Device Protection</a>.<br/>
<br/>
The update also adds <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/11/apple-music-collaborative-playlists-2024/">collaborative Apple Music playlists</a>, a feature that lets <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/">Apple Music</a> subscribers share playlists with others to build shared song lists. Collaborative playlists are simple to use, can be shared with a link, and support emoji reactions.<br/>
<br/>
Last week, Apple pulled the second betas of iOS 17.3 and iPadOS 17.3 after the updates caused devices to go into a perpetual boot loop. Apple did not re-release the second betas, but presumably the issue is fixed in the third betas. <br/>
<br/>
Apple is expected to release iOS 17.3 later in January.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-17/">iPadOS 17</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-17.241">iOS 17</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-17.242">iPadOS 17</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/09/apple-releases-ios-17-3-beta-3-to-developers/">Apple Seeds Third Betas of iOS 17.3 and iPadOS 17.3 to Developers</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-seeds-third-betas-of-ios-17-3-and-ipados-17-3-to-developers.2415892/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

To install the ‌watchOS 10.3‌ update, developers will need to open the Apple Watch app, go to the Software Update section under "General" in Settings, and toggle on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/watchos-10/">watchOS 10</a> Developer Beta.

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's upcoming <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Vision Pro</a> headset is equipped with 16GB of unified memory, according to files related to the device in Xcode 15.2.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/apple-vision-pro-chips.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-898904" /><br/>
Our finding in the latest version of Apple's app development tool confirms a June 2023 report from <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-06-02/apple-wwdc-2023-mixed-reality-headset-ios-17-and-other-products-to-expect"><em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman</a> that said the Vision Pro would be equipped with 16GB of RAM, and that is also the same amount of memory that was included in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/07/24/apple-vision-pro-developer-kits-now-available/">Vision Pro development kits</a> distributed by Apple last year.<br/>
<br/>
Xcode 15.2 officially <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/08/apple-releases-vision-pro-updates-testflight-xcode/">adds support for developing visionOS apps</a>, and Apple is now accepting these apps via App Store Connect.<br/>
<br/>
In a press release this week, Apple reiterated that the Vision Pro will be powered by its M2 chip for "powerful standalone performance," along with an all-new R1 chip that "processes input from 12 cameras, five sensors, and six microphones to ensure that content feels like it is appearing right in front of the user's eyes."<br/>
<br/>
Apple's press release also confirmed that the Vision Pro will start at &#36;3,499 in the U.S. with 256GB of storage, and this wording seems to imply that higher storage capacity options will also be available. It was reported last year that at least some of the Vision Pro developer kits were equipped with 1TB of storage.<br/>
<br/>
Apple has yet to share full tech specs for the Vision Pro, which will be available to pre-order in the U.S. <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/08/apple-announces-february-2-vision-pro-launch/">starting Friday, January 19</a> at 5 a.m. Pacific Time. The headset will launch there a few weeks later, on Friday, February 2. When it first announced the Vision Pro, Apple said the headset would launch in additional countries later this year.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple has a detailed plan for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a> reviews, according to <a href="https://twitter.com/markgurman/status/1744774909262483693"><em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman</a>. YouTubers and members of the media selected for reviews will meet with Apple on January 16 for a hands-on experience, with a follow-up meeting to take place on January 23 to go over the device's features a second time.<br/>
<br/>

Reviews are set to be published at the end of January, which is just ahead of when Apple plans to launch the Vision Pro.<br/>
<br/>
It is no surprise that Apple plans to have a firm hold on the review process and the experience that reviewers undergo, as it has kept headsets provided to developers similarly locked down.<br/>
<br/>
Apple plans to begin accepting pre-orders for the Vision Pro on Friday, January 19, ahead of when reviews are published. The Vision Pro will then launch on Friday, February 2, with Apple planning to provide in-store demonstrations starting on that day.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-vision-pro.209">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/09/apple-vision-pro-reviews-multiple-meetings/">Apple &#039;Carefully Orchestrating&#039; Vision Pro Reviews With Multiple Meetings</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-carefully-orchestrating-vision-pro-reviews-with-multiple-meetings.2415886/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[<a href="https://satechi.net">Satechi</a> today introduced two new Qi2 charging options, including the 3-in-1 Foldable Qi2 Wireless Charging Stand and 2-in-1 Foldable Qi2 Wireless Charging Stand. With next-generation Qi2 charging technology, Satechi's chargers are able to charge <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe-battery-pack/">MagSafe</a> iPhones at up to 15W, the same as official &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; chargers from Apple.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/satechi-3-in-1-charger.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-929700" /><br/>
The 3-in-1 stand from Satechi also includes a 5W Apple Watch charger and a 5W wireless charger that's designed for the AirPods, while the 2-in-1 stand has a spot for charging the AirPods. Both chargers feature a vegan leather base, an aluminum housing, and a soft silicone charging puck, and they are able to fold down for travel when not in use.<br/>
<br/>
Satechi's 3-in-1 stand is able to provide fast-charging capabilities for the Apple Watch Series 7 and later, plus it comes with a 45W USB-C power adapter. Qi2 uses the same magnetic power profile as &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj;, so these stands work like &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; stands without the 7.5W limitation of the prior Qi standard.<br/>
<br/>

The 3-in-1 Foldable Qi2 Wireless Charging Stand will be priced at &#36;130, while the 2-in-1 Foldable Qi2 Wireless Charging Stand will be priced at &#36;80. Both chargers are <a href="https://satechi.net">set to launch</a> in the second quarter of 2024.<br/>
<br/>
Satechi today also announced the launch of the SM1 Slim Mechanical Backlit Bluetooth Keyboard, the company's first mechanical keyboard option. It is compatible with the Mac, and it is <a href="https://satechi.net/products/sm1-slim-mechanical-backlit-bluetooth-keyboard">priced at &#36;100</a>.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/satechi/">Satechi</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ces-2024/">CES 2024</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/09/ces-2024-satechi-qi2-chargers/">CES 2024: Satechi Debuts New Qi2 Wireless Charging Stands</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ces-2024-satechi-debuts-new-qi2-wireless-charging-stands.2415880/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>
