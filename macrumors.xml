Employees were told about a development pause last week, with engineers asked to focus on fixing flaws and boosting software performance.<br/>
<br/>
Apple's software chief Craig Federighi has been making an effort in recent years to ensure that software bugs are addressed, sometimes resulting in features that need to be delayed. Sources that spoke to Gurman said that with the upcoming software updates, the software engineering management team working under Federighi found too many bugs that were missed in internal testing, leading to a week-long sprint to address the issues.<br/>
<br/>
During that week period, all development on future features was stopped to allow engineers to work solely on improving the existing software. Apple is lifting the pause this week so that work on new capabilities for iOS 18 and its sister updates can continue.<br/>
<br/>
Apple last month finished the first "<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m1/">M1</a>" versions of iOS 18, iPadOS 18, and macOS 15. Work on further development was paused, with Apple also taking a brief break from working on iOS 17.4, expected to be released next March. Given that work on future software was only paused for a week, no release delays are expected next year. <br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/07/apple-engineers-ios-18-bug-fix-focus/">Apple Briefly Paused Work on New Features for iOS 18 and macOS 15 to Clean Up Bugs</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-briefly-paused-work-on-new-features-for-ios-18-and-macos-15-to-clean-up-bugs.2410180/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Choosing a new Mac often involves consideration of the many Apple silicon chips now on offer, so our comprehensive guide covers their generations, variations, and performance benchmarks to help you decide which is best for you.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/07/Mac-Chip-Comparison-Buyers-Guide-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-902570" /><br/>
After iterating for over a decade in the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>, Apple in 2020 brought its custom silicon chip technology to the Mac, enabling major performance and power efficiency improvements. Since then, Apple silicon has expanded to every Mac model, spurring new designs and capabilities that were previously impossible.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/07/Apple-M3-chip-series.jpg" alt="" width="3840" height="2160" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-920046" /><br/>
<br/>
Understanding the distinctions between Apple silicon chips will help you make an informed decision when selecting the right Mac for your needs. There have been three generations of Apple silicon for the Mac, each with up to four different chip variants. The main differences between the four different chip variants are as follows:<br/>
<br/>
<ul><br/>
<li><strong>M1, M2, and M3</strong>: Standard Apple silicon chip with a balance of performance and power-efficiency. </li><br/>
<li><strong>M1 Pro, M2 Pro, and M3 Pro</strong>: Apple silicon chip with additional high-performance CPU cores. The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m1-pro/">M1 Pro</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m2/">M2</a> Pro feature twice the memory bandwidth of the &zwnj;M2&zwnj; and M3 chips (200GB/s), while the M3 Pro features 50% more memory bandwidth than the &zwnj;M2&zwnj; and M3 chips (150GB/s).</li><br/>
<li><strong>M1 Max, M2 Max, and M3 Max</strong>: Doubles the GPU cores of the &zwnj;M1 Pro&zwnj;, &zwnj;M2&zwnj; Pro, or M3 Pro and features up to twice the memory bandwidth (400GB/s) of the &zwnj;M1 Pro&zwnj; or &zwnj;M2&zwnj; Pro chips for better graphics performance. M3 Max also adds extra CPU cores.</li><br/>
<li><strong>M1 Ultra and M2 Ultra</strong>: Encompasses two <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m1-max/">M1 Max</a> or &zwnj;M2&zwnj; Max chips for double overall CPU and GPU performance, as well as twice the memory bandwidth (800GB/s).</li><br/>
</ul><br/>
<br/>
<h3 id="apple_silicon_generations">Apple Silicon Generations</h3><br/>
With the introduction of the &zwnj;M2&zwnj; series of chips in 2022 and M3 series of chips in 2023, Apple made some key improvements over the initial <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m1/">M1</a> series from 2020.<br/>

<h3 id="cpu_and_gpu_cores">CPU and GPU Cores</h3><br/>
CPU cores are individual processing units within a Central Processing Unit (CPU) responsible for executing instructions and performing general-purpose tasks, while GPU cores are specialized units within a Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) designed for parallel processing and graphics-intensive tasks.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2013/09/m1-max-chip.jpg" alt="" width="2143" height="1248" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-821786" /><br/>
The number of CPU and GPU cores in an Apple silicon chip impacts the performance and multitasking capabilities of a Mac, with more cores leading to faster and more efficient execution of tasks, especially in intensive workloads. The table below presents a comparison of the core configurations and GPU specifications for the different variants of the &zwnj;M1&zwnj; and &zwnj;M2&zwnj; chips:<br/>

Deciding how many CPU cores you need depends on the specific tasks and workflows you intend to perform on your Mac. For example, if you primarily engage in basic tasks like web browsing, document editing, and media consumption, an eight-core CPU should suffice. On the other hand, if you work with demanding workloads like software development, opting for a higher core count can provide significant performance benefits. Similarly, graphics-intense workflows like video editing, 3D modeling, or gaming will benefit from additional GPU cores.<br/>
<br/>
<h3 id="benchmarks">Benchmarks</h3><br/>
Computer benchmark scores are standardized measurements that evaluate the performance of chips, providing a numerical representation for comparing capabilities and assessing performance against industry standards.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
The data on the below table is calculated from Geekbench 6 <a href="https://browser.geekbench.com/mac-benchmarks">results users uploaded to Geekbench</a>. Geekbench 6 scores are calibrated against a baseline score of 2,500 (which is the score of an Intel Core i7-12700 performing the same task).<br/>

The &zwnj;M1&zwnj;, &zwnj;M2&zwnj;, and M3 chips demonstrate performance improvements in single-core and multi-core tasks as you move from the base to the Ultra variants, with the M3 chip showcasing even higher performance across the board. Nevertheless, it is worth noting that benchmarks do not tell the whole story. Benchmarks focus on specific tasks and synthetic workloads, and do not always accurately capture real-world usage scenarios and variations.<br/>
<br/>
<h3 id="unified_memory">Unified Memory</h3><br/>
Apple silicon chips have a unified memory architecture, meaning that the RAM is tied directly to the processor for maximum speed and efficiency. This means that the chip you choose determines what memory option are available, and it is not upgradable at a later date. <br/>

Deciding how much RAM you need depends on your specific tasks and usage patterns. 8GB should be enough for most users, but upgrading to 16GB or 24GB could be sensible for users with more intense multitasking requirements. Amounts of memory beyond 32GB are generally reserved for seriously demanding workflows.<br/>
<br/>
<h3 id="final_thoughts">Final Thoughts</h3><br/>
Overall, if you are new to Apple silicon and are still not sure which chip to buy, use the following rationale:<br/>
<br/>
<ul><br/>
<li><strong>Buy M1, M2, or M3 if...</strong> you need a good balance of price, performance, and battery life and have normal day-to-day computing requirements.</li><br/>
<li><strong>Buy M1 Pro, M2 Pro, or M3 Pro if...</strong> you need a performance-focused chip for slightly more intense workflows.</li><br/>
<li><strong>Buy M1 Max, M2 Max, or M3 Max if...</strong> you need additional graphics performance for working with images, videos, graphic design, or games.</li><br/>
<li><strong>Buy M1 Ultra or M2 Ultra if...</strong> you need the best possible overall performance for extremely intense professional workflows.</li><br/>
</ul><br/>
<br/>
It is generally not worth upgrading from any of the individual &zwnj;M1&zwnj; chips to their direct successors and it may be better to wait for Apple to launch the M4 series of chips at some point in the next couple of years before upgrading if you are already an &zwnj;M2&zwnj; user.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/">iMac</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-studio/">Mac Studio</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/">MacBook Air</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro-13/">MacBook Pro 13"</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro/">MacBook Pro 14 & 16" </a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-mini/">Mac mini</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-pro/">Mac Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-silicon/">Apple Silicon</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iMac">iMac (Buy Now)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Mac-Studio">Mac Studio (Neutral)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#15-MacBook-Air">15" MacBook Air (Neutral)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Pro_13">13" MacBook Pro (Don't Buy)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Pro_16">14" & 16" MacBook Pro (Buy Now)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Air">13" MacBook Air (Don't Buy)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Mac_Mini">Mac Mini (Neutral)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Mac_Pro">Mac Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/imac.91">iMac</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/mac-studio.237">Mac Studio</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macbook-air.122">MacBook Air</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macbook-pro.90">MacBook Pro</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/mac-mini.146">Mac mini</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/mac-pro.1">Mac Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-silicon-buyers-guide/">Apple Silicon Buyer&#039;s Guide: Which Chip Should You Choose?</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-silicon-buyers-guide-which-chip-should-you-choose.2395320/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple plans to discontinue the 12.9-inch iPad Pro with mini-LED backlighting in 2024, according to a recent report from <a href="https://www.trendforce.com/presscenter/news/20231103-11903.html">Taiwanese research firm TrendForce</a>, suggesting that the tablet will not remain in the lineup for a reduced price following the launch of the rumored 13-inch iPad Pro with an OLED display next year.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/05/ipad-pro-m1-feature.jpg" alt="" width="1780" height="1001" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-800056" /><br/>
TrendForce:<blockquote>The shipment volume for Mini LED notebooks is estimated to decrease by approximately 39% YoY. Meanwhile, with the 12.9-inch iPad Pro expected to be discontinued in 2024, the shipment volume of Mini LED tablets is expected to decrease by about 15.6% YoY, making these two the only applications expected to decline.</blockquote>In December 2022, oft-accurate display industry analyst Ross Young was first to report that the 12.9-inch iPad Pro would be succeeded by a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/12/29/oled-ipads-2024/">slightly larger 13-inch model</a> with an OLED display. <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman expects new 11-inch and 13-inch iPad Pro models with <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/03/gurman-new-ipad-magic-keyboard-to-feature-aluminum/">OLED displays, an M3 chip, and an aluminum Magic Keyboard</a> to launch next year.<br/>
<br/>
OLED display technology would allow for the next iPad Pro models to offer increased brightness, higher contrast ratio, greater color accuracy, and lower power consumption compared to the existing models with LCD panels. Young said Apple would be using very thin hybrid OLED displays with a combination of flexible and rigid materials, which could allow for the next iPad Pro models to have a slightly thinner design.<br/>
<br/>
iPad Pro models released since 2017 support ProMotion, allowing for a variable refresh rate between 24Hz and 120Hz. The switch to OLED would likely allow for the refresh rate to drop down even further to 10Hz or lower to save battery life. iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro models can reach as low as 1Hz while in always-on display mode.<br/>
<br/>
Apple is also <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/05/all-ipads-expected-to-be-updated-in-2024/">expected to update the iPad Air, iPad mini, and entry-level iPad</a> in 2024, but none of those models are expected to switch to OLED next year. <div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/trendforce/">TrendForce</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#12-9-iPad-Pro">12.9" iPad Pro (Caution)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipad.137">iPad</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/07/12-9-inch-ipad-pro-discontinued-2024-report/">12.9-Inch iPad Pro With Mini-LED Display Expected to Be Discontinued Next Year</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/12-9-inch-ipad-pro-with-mini-led-display-expected-to-be-discontinued-next-year.2410171/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple has expanded High Power Mode to the new 14-inch MacBook Pro with the M3 Max chip, according to <a href="https://sixcolors.com/post/2023/11/m3-macbook-pro-review-peak-performance/"><em>Six Colors</em> editor-in-chief Jason Snell</a>. The feature was previously only available on the 16-inch MacBook Pro with the M1 Max and M2 Max.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/High-Power-Mode-Feature-2.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-921421" /><br/>
"For some tests, I switched the MacBook Pro into High Power Mode, which is now available on both 14- and 16-inch models in the M3 Max configuration," wrote Snell, in his review of the new MacBook Pros. "I didn't actually find it made much of a difference in the tests I was running, but it sure did make the fans kick in at a very loud volume."<br/>
<br/>
In a <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212852">support document</a>, Apple says High Power Mode allows a MacBook Pro's fans to run at higher speeds, and this additional cooling may allow the system to deliver higher performance for "intensive sustained workloads," such as 8K video color grading.<br/>
<br/>
On macOS Ventura and later, High Power Mode can be enabled in the System Settings app under Battery by clicking on the dropdown menus next to "On battery" or "On power adapter" and selecting the "High Power" option.<br/>

Switching to iPad Air models, the 2022 64GB Wi-Fi tablet has hit <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB09V3KXJPB%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26th%3D1%26geniuslink%3Dtrue"><strong>&#36;499.99</strong></a> on Amazon, down from &#36;599.00. That's a solid all-time low price on this model, and you can also find a few other storage configurations at record lows this time around. Note that for the majority of colors, you'll need to clip an on-page coupon to see these deals.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's new entry-level 14-inch MacBook Pro with the standard M3 chip <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/06/first-m3-mac-orders-australia-nz/">began arriving to customers</a> over the past day, and some early adopters have discovered that the laptop cannot currently be updated to macOS Sonoma over the air.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/No-13-Inch-M3-MacBook-Pro-Feature-2.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-921296" /><br/>
As <a href="https://twitter.com/aaronp613/status/1721742053170684065">noted by @aaronp613 on X</a>, at least some 14-inch MacBook Pro models with the M3 chip shipped with an unreleased build of macOS Ventura 13.5 installed. When users attempt to update to macOS Sonoma in the System Settings app, macOS Ventura 13.5 is listed as the latest version available instead of macOS Sonoma 14.1.<br/>
<br/>
One user who experienced this issue is <a href="https://twitter.com/ZONEofTECH/status/1721868285732344224">Daniel Rotar</a>, host of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@ZONEofTECH/">YouTube channel ZONEofTECH</a>, according to a post he shared on X today. Additional users across <a href="https://twitter.com/nacookan/status/1721867659963412668">X</a> and the <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/first-m3-macbook-pro-and-imac-orders-begin-arriving-to-customers.2410091/post-32702848">MacRumors Forums</a> have mentioned the issue.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Ok, here’s something weird. <br><br>Our M3 MacBook Pro shipped with Ventura and can’t seem to update to Sonoma at all. Version not compatible. <br><br>Our M3 Pro MacBook Pro shipped with Sonoma. <br><br>Did anyone else get an M3 that shipped with Ventura? <a href="https://t.co/me0kLZjk6f">pic.twitter.com/me0kLZjk6f</a></p>&mdash; Daniel (@ZONEofTECH) <a href="https://twitter.com/ZONEofTECH/status/1721868285732344224?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 7, 2023</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div><br/>
Given that macOS Ventura 13.5 was released in July, it seems that Apple began stockpiling the 14-inch MacBook Pro with the M3 chip several months ago. <br/>
<br/>
It's unclear when Apple will address this problem, but in the meantime, software researcher <a href="https://twitter.com/nicolas09F9">Nicolás Álvarez</a> <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/first-m3-macbook-pro-and-imac-orders-begin-arriving-to-customers.2410091/post-32702982">said</a> that affected users can <a href="https://swcdn.apple.com/content/downloads/54/11/042-41700-A_6GDS7ETYNV/zxpkgymp3w9bm3py7ybs9n9ud27qwnwx7u/InstallAssistant.pkg">download the Install Assistant</a> for the M3-compatible version of macOS Sonoma 14.1 and manually install the update. We'll update this story as additional information becomes available.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Starting today, Apple's refreshed M3 iMac and MacBook Pro models with M3 and M3 Pro chips are available for same-day or next-day pickup at Apple Stores, with no pre-order required. Online orders are also beginning to arrive to customers today. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/m3-imac.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="902" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-919460" /><br/>
Customers across the United States, Canada, Europe, Asia, and other regions can now place an order on Apple's website or in the Apple Store app and arrange for in-store pickup at a local retail location.<br/>
<br/>
To order a product with Apple Store pickup, add the product to your bag on Apple.com, proceed to checkout, select the "I'll pick it up" option, enter your ZIP code, choose an available Apple Store location, and select a pickup date. Payment is completed online, and a valid government-issued photo ID and the order number may be required upon pickup.<br/>
<br/>
The refreshed 24-inch iMac includes an Apple-designed M3 Arm-based chip that replaces the M1 chip and brings significant speed and efficiency improvements. The iMac with M3 chip is up to 2x faster than the M1 iMac, with support for up to 24GB of unified memory, Bluetooth 5.3 and Wi-Fi 6E. There are no major external design changes to the M3 iMac, which is available in a range of bright colors, including green, blue, pink, silver, orange, yellow, and purple. <br/>
<br/>
The 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models can be purchased today with the M3 and M3 Pro chips, while models with the new M3 Max chip won't become available until later in November. The MacBook Pro models have slightly brighter display levels when viewing SDR content, and also include support for Wi-Fi 6E and Bluetooth 5.3. Apple offers the MacBook Pro in silver, space gray, and space black aluminum color options, depending on chip configuration.<br/>
<br/>
Pricing for the MacBook Pro starts at &#36;1,599 for the 14-inch model and &#36;2,499 for the 16-inch model, while the iMac starts at &#36;1,299.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/">iMac</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro/">MacBook Pro 14 & 16" </a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m3/">M3</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iMac">iMac (Buy Now)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Pro_16">14" & 16" MacBook Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/imac.91">iMac</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macbook-pro.90">MacBook Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/07/m3-imac-macbook-pro-now-available/">M3 iMac and MacBook Pro Models Now Available for Same-Day Pickup</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/m3-imac-and-macbook-pro-models-now-available-for-same-day-pickup.2410137/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Google <a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/thread/242690316/testing-new-experimental-generative-ai-features">today announced</a> that it is testing two new generative AI features designed to improve the YouTube viewing experience. A select number of YouTube users will have access to these new additions during Google's testing period.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/google-ai-youtube.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-921299" /><br/>
For YouTube videos with long comment threads, YouTube will use artificial intelligence to organize them into themes or comment topics to facilitate conversation. Google says that creators can use these comment summaries to jump into comment discussions or draw inspiration for new content.<br/>
<br/>
Topics are pulled from published comments, and will not be created from comments held for review or that include blocked words. The comment test is being done on mobile, so users who have access will see a star topic on a small number of videos in English.<br/>
<br/>
YouTube is also gaining a conversational AI tool that is able to provide answers to questions about the video that you're watching. It can provide background information, offer up suggestions for related content, and more, without interrupting playback. For academic videos, the AI is able to provide quizzes and responses that Google says "encourage deeper understanding."<br/>
<br/>
Conversational AI is available to a small number of people on a subset of videos, and those who have access will see a star icon.<br/>
<br/>
While some users have access to these options for test purposes, YouTube Premium subscribers <a href="https://www.youtube.com/new">can opt in to these new features</a> as the YouTube Premium subscription includes access to experimental features. Comment topics are available to premium members today, while the conversational AI option will be available in the coming weeks.<br/>
<br/>
Google says that the AI features are experimental and that the company "may not always get it right," which is why these tests are available to a limited number of customers as Google collects feedback.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/06/generative-ai-tools-youtube/">Google Experimenting With New Generative AI Features for YouTube</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/google-experimenting-with-new-generative-ai-features-for-youtube.2410105/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2023/11/final-cut-pro-for-mac-and-ipad-get-powerful-updates/">today announced upcoming updates</a> for Final Cut Pro, with the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> and Mac apps set to gain new features that Apple says will streamline workflows.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/final-cut-pro.jpg" alt="" width="1960" height="1102" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-921303" /><br/>
Final Cut Pro on the Mac will be updated with organizational refinements like automatic timeline scrolling. Users will be able to keep their clips in view during playback, with the view able to be adjusted using keyboard shortcuts or the Zoom option.<br/>
<br/>
The organization of the timeline will be viewable at a glance, and it will be easier to differentiate clips by assigned role using distinct colors. Apple is also adding tools for cleaning up complex timeline sections and fine tuning edits by combining overlapping connected clips into a single connected storyline.<br/>
<br/>
On Apple silicon Macs, exporting projects in H.264 and HEVC will be faster than before as Final Cut Pro is able to send video segments to available media engines for simultaneous processing.<br/>
<br/>
On the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj;, the updated version of Final Cut Pro will include voiceover capabilities that will let creators record narration and audio directly into the timeline with the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj;. In pro camera mode, stabilization will now improve shaky footage for smoother video, and there are new options for combining connected clips.<br/>
<br/>
Editing is being sped up through new keyboard shortcuts for voiceover and grouping clips, plus there are new color-grading presets and titles.<br/>
<br/>
The new versions of Final Cut Pro will be coming to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a> later this month and they will be free to existing users. Final Cut Pro for Mac is priced at &#36;300, and Final Cut Pro for &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; is priced at &#36;4.99 per month or &#36;49 per year.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/06/final-cut-pro-mac-ipad-new-features/">Final Cut Pro Gaining New Features on Mac and iPad Later This Month</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/final-cut-pro-gaining-new-features-on-mac-and-ipad-later-this-month.2410097/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[When new products launch, Apple fans in Australia and New Zealand are always the first to get their hands on updated devices because of their time zone. It is Tuesday, November 7 in those two countries, which means customers who ordered a new M3 MacBook Pro or <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/">iMac</a> are now beginning to receive their shipments.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/m3-macbook-pro-blue.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-919851" /><br/>
Apple customers will soon be sharing photos and first impressions of the New Macs on Instagram, Twitter, Reddit, and the <em>MacRumors</em> forums. If you've received a new Mac, make sure to let us know your thoughts in the comments below!<br/>
<br/>
Apple introduced the new Macs at its "Scary Fast" event on October 30, which was the first nighttime event that Apple has held. Apple debuted the M3-series chips, and it also marked the first time that standard, Pro, and Max Apple silicon chips have been introduced at the same time.<br/>
<br/>
The 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models can be purchased with the M3, M3 Pro, or M3 Max chip, while the 24-inch &zwnj;iMac&zwnj; has the M3. Today's orders will feature the M3 and M3 Pro machines, as the MacBook Pro models with M3 Max had delivery dates ranging from November 9 to November 13 when Apple first began accepting orders. We won't see customers with the initial M3 Max MacBook Pro orders until later this week.<br/>
<br/>
Apple made no design updates to the MacBook Pro or the &zwnj;iMac&zwnj; when it refreshed the chips inside. The MacBook Pro models also received a minor display update to increase the SDR brightness by 100 nits, while the &zwnj;iMac&zwnj; also got support for Wi-Fi 6E, more maximum memory, and Bluetooth 5.3.<br/>
<br/>
Built on 3-nanometer technology, the M3 chips have a next-generation GPU with support for hardware-accelerated ray tracing and mesh shading, along with Dynamic Caching for improved GPU utilization. According to Apple, the M3, M3 Pro, and M3 Max chips are up to 50 percent faster than the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m2/">M2</a>, &zwnj;M2&zwnj; Pro, and &zwnj;M2&zwnj; Max chips.<br/>
<br/>
New Zealand does not have any Apple retail stores, so customers in Australia will be the first to be able to pick up one of the new Macs in an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-store/">Apple Store</a>. We are not expecting supply shortages, and the updated machines should be readily available for those who want one. Note that Apple Stores offer stock configurations, so customers who want to upgrade the memory, SSD, or chip will need to order a custom machine online.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[A minor iOS 17.1.1 update is likely to be released for the iPhone this week, as a protected account with a proven track record shared the build number 21B91 for the update today on X, formerly known as Twitter. The account typically shares build numbers for upcoming iOS updates less than a week before they are released.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/iOS-17.1.1-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-920500" /><br/>
Last week, we were first to report that Apple was <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/02/ios-17-1-1-is-coming/">internally testing iOS 17.1.1</a>, based on evidence of the software version in our website's analytics logs. The update will almost certainly be focused on bug fixes and security patches.<br/>
<br/>
It's unclear exactly which bugs will be addressed in iOS 17.1.1. The update might include the same <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/30/ios-17-2-beta-addresses-wifi-issues/">fix for Wi-Fi connectivity issues</a> that Apple rolled out in the iOS 17.2 beta, and it could resolve an issue where <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/18/ios-17-1-shutdown-bug-no-fix/">some iPhones temporarily shut off overnight</a> for users still experiencing that. Apple also <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/25/apple-to-fix-iphone-15-bmw-charging-issue/">promised to fix a BMW wireless charging issue</a> affecting the iPhone 15 lineup in an unspecified update coming later this year.<br/>
<br/>
iOS 17.2 remains in beta testing, and it is expected to be released in December. That update includes <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/26/ios-17-2-beta-1-features/">many new features and changes</a>, including Apple's promised Journal app, the ability for Apple Music subscribers to collaborate on playlists, a Translate option for the Action button on iPhone 15 Pro models, an iMessage Contact Key Verification security option, additional Weather and Clock widgets, and more.<br/>
<br/>
We also reported that Apple is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/04/watchos-update-to-fix-battery-drain-issue/">preparing to release a watchOS update soon</a> with a fix for excessive Apple Watch battery drain. It's likely that update will be watchOS 10.1.1, but it could be watchOS 10.2 if Apple needs more time.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-17/">iPadOS 17</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-17.241">iOS 17</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-17.242">iPadOS 17</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/06/ios-17-1-1-likely-to-be-released-this-week/">Apple Likely to Release iOS 17.1.1 This Week With iPhone Bug Fixes</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-likely-to-release-ios-17-1-1-this-week-with-iphone-bug-fixes.2410080/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple last week began shipping out the new USB-C <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-pencil/">Apple Pencil</a>, so we thought we'd check it out for <em>MacRumors</em> readers who might be interested in purchasing one. The USB-C &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; is compatible with all iPads that have a USB-C port and that are running iOS 17.1 or later. <br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MbuXDZ_VKRA" title="New Apple Pencil (USB-C) - Unboxing &amp; Hands-On!" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe><em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/macrumors?sub_confirmation=1">Subscribe to the MacRumors YouTube channel</a> for more videos.</em></div><br/>
When it comes to design and feel, the USB-C &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; is much like the second-generation &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj;, featuring a matte finish and a flat side where it can attach to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>, but it's worth noting that it's shorter. Unlike the &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; 2, it is not able to pair with an &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; automatically, and you'll need a USB-C cable for pairing purposes. <br/>
<br/>
If you pull on the bottom of the &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj;, you'll reveal a USB-C port, but Apple does not include a cable so you will need to use your own. Pairing can be done by attaching a USB-C to USB-C cable to the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; and the USB-C port. <br/>
<br/>
Though the USB-C &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; can be placed on the top of the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; thanks to the magnetic connection, it is not able to charge magnetically like the &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; 2. As with pairing, charging is done via USB-C. <br/>
<br/>
The USB-C &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; is the most affordable &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; option at &#36;79, but it lacks Double Tap for swapping tools, and there is no pressure sensitivity for varying line thickness. It does support tilt functionality and the &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; Hover gesture that's available on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m2/">M2</a> &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; models. <br/>
<br/>

		<title>Report: Apple Developing Custom Batteries for Launch in 2025</title>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple is developing custom batteries with significantly improved performance that it aims to bring to its devices starting in 2025, <a href="https://m.etnews.com/20231106000233"><em>ETNews</em></a> reports.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/macbook-air-spacegray-purple-battery.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-913843" /><br/>
Apple's custom battery technology has reportedly been in the works since 2018, with the company actively seeking patents and hiring new personnel related to the project. The company is reportedly seeking to create an "all-new" kind of battery with significantly improved performance by becoming directly involved in its use of materials.<br/>
<br/>
Apple is apparently curating the battery's cathode materials to determine its performance, energy density, output, and stability. The battery apparently uses a completely different composition from those that currently exist on the market, adopting a new composition of nickel, cobalt, manganese, and aluminum. <br/>
<br/>
The company is considering the use of carbon nanotubes to improve the conductivity of battery materials, delivering better performance from lesser-used battery materials. Apple is also looking to increase its battery's silicon content, replacing graphite to increase capacity, and shorten charging and discharging times.<br/>
<br/>
The result is expected to be an innovative battery type that has not yet been commercialized. A source familiar with Apple's plans suggested to <em>ETNews</em> that the Vision Pro headset has dramatically increased the company's need for high-performance batteries. The headset features just two hours of battery life. Other devices such as the Apple Watch and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> have been left with the same "all-day" battery life since their introduction.<br/>
<br/>
Apple's custom battery project was reportedly co-developed with the company's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-car/">electric vehicle project</a>, but the mobile applications are now the main target for the technology. It is expected to begin being added to Apple devices starting in 2025.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/etnews-com/">ETNews</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/06/apple-developing-custom-batteries-for-2025/">Report: Apple Developing Custom Batteries for Launch in 2025</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/report-apple-developing-custom-batteries-for-launch-in-2025.2410051/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

When you purchase two or more Anker items, you'll get 25 percent off your order. Additionally, there are numerous straight cash discounts on dozens of Anker accessories during the event.<br/>
<br/>

When you click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment, which helps us keep the site running.</small></em><br/>
<br/>
There are plenty of great accessories that you can buy to take advantage of the bundle savings, including the new MagSafe-compatible <a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=J2shFQg6J/U&mid=43469&murl=https://www.anker.com/products/y1811?ref=black-friday-sale">Anker 3-in-1 Charging Cube</a> (&#36;149.95).

Although this one is on sale at &#36;110.49 without the bundle deal, if you buy this and the 3-in-1 Cube together, you'll net a bigger discount. The Power Bank will be knocked down to &#36;97.50 and the 3-in-1 Cube will go down to &#36;112.46 thanks to the 25 percent savings.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Last week, Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/30/apple-announces-m3-macbook-pros/">updated the 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models</a> with M3 Pro and M3 Max chips for faster performance. There is also an entry-level 14-inch MacBook Pro with the standard M3 chip. Other new features include a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/31/space-black-macbook-pro-hands-on-videos/">Space Black finish</a> for M3 Pro and M3 Max configurations, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/30/new-macbook-pros-20-percent-brighter-displays/">20% brighter displays</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/m3-mbp-space-black.jpg" alt="" width="1440" height="810" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-919466" /><br/>
The new MacBook Pro models will begin arriving to customers and launch in stores on Tuesday, November 7, although M3 Max configurations do not launch until a few days later. Ahead of time, the first reviews of the laptops have been shared by select media outlets and YouTube channels, and we have rounded up some of them below.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Written Reviews</h2><br/>
Geekbench 6 benchmark results for the new MacBook Pro models already leaked last week. The results showed that the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/01/m3-chip-benchmark-results/">M3 chip is up to 20% faster than the M2 chip</a>, the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/05/m3-pro-chip-benchmark-result/">M3 Pro is up to 6% faster than the M2 Pro</a>, and the M3 Max is up to 50% faster than the M2 Max and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/01/m3-max-chip-benchmark-results/">roughly on par with the M2 Ultra chip</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/computing/apple-macbook-pro-16-late-2023-review-max-power-for-creators/"><em>CNET</em>'s Lori Grunin</a> on M3 vs. M3 Max performance:<blockquote>For a sense of practical scale within the M3 line, the MacBook Pro 14 with the base processor took just under 20 minutes to import (with lens corrections on import) and simultaneously create full-resolution previews of around 1,000 raw+JPEG photos and videos; the MacBook 16 Pro took just over 8.5 minutes. Lightroom import and thumbnail generation is CPU and memory-bound, which explains much of the difference.</blockquote>Both the M2 Pro and M3 Pro are equipped with up to a 12-core CPU, but the M3 Pro has two fewer high-performance CPU cores. So while the M3 Pro is manufactured with TSMC's improved 3nm process, compared to 5nm for the M2 Pro, the chip's resulting performance gains are diminished due to this change. Apple says the M3 Pro also has <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/31/apple-m3-pro-less-memory-bandwidth/">25% less memory bandwidth</a> and one fewer GPU core compared to the M2 Pro.<br/>
<br/>
M3 series chips offer not only performance and power efficiency improvements over M2 series chips, but they also have an upgraded GPU with support for hardware-accelerated ray tracing and mesh shading for improved graphics rendering in games.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/11/review-apples-16-inch-m3-max-macbook-pro-crams-ultra-level-speed-into-a-laptop/"><em>Ars Technica</em>'s Andrew Cunningham</a> on M3 Max graphics performance:<blockquote>Graphics performance also sees a solid boost, more than you'd expect from just a pair of extra GPU cores. The M3 Max benchmarks around 50 percent faster than the M1 Max—and playing Baldur's Gate 3 on it with all the settings turned up was actually by-and-large a pleasant experience. The Mac still isn't a viable AAA game platform for most people, but Apple does seem to be trying, and if it ever succeeds, the M3 Max will be up for it.</blockquote>Apple says the new Space Black finish features an "anodization seal" to "greatly reduce fingerprints," presumably compared to the MacBook Air's dark Midnight finish. Based on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/31/space-black-macbook-pro-hands-on-videos/">hands-on videos shared following Apple's event</a>, the new anti-fingerprint seal does appear to be an improvement compared to the MacBook Air.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/extras/indybest/gadgets-tech/laptops-tablets/apple-macbook-pro-m3-review-b2442362.html"><em>The Independent</em>'s David Phelan</a> on the Space Black finish and fingerprints:<blockquote>When Apple announced the new space black version, it made a big deal out of one aspect: although it's a matte finish, it doesn't collect fingerprints. Apple says this is down to what it calls "breakthrough chemistry" – there's an anodization seal that reduces fingerprint marks. Whatever the science, it really works. Marks may not vanish completely but they are very hard to spot.</blockquote><a href="https://mobilesyrup.com/2023/11/06/apple-m3-max-macbook-pro-imac-benchmarks/"><em>MobileSyrup</em>'s Patrick O'Rourke</a>:<blockquote>What's most notable about Space Black is the anodization seal that prevents most grease and smudges from getting on the laptop. When Apple mentioned this during its keynote, I assumed it was just marketing, but to my surprise, it was tough to get grease to appear on the Space Black M3 MacBook Pro I've been using for the last few days. If your hands are exceptionally grimy, it's still possible and isn't entirely as perfect as I initially thought, but it happens so infrequently it's shocking.</blockquote>Apple's tech specs indicate that all of the new 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models provide up to 600 nits of peak brightness for standard/SDR content, which is a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/30/new-macbook-pros-20-percent-brighter-displays/">20% increase</a> over the 500 nits maximum on the previous models. This means the laptops now have the same peak brightness as Apple's Studio Display.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/laptops/apple-16-inch-macbook-pro-late-2023"><em>Tom's Hardware</em>'s Brandon Hill</a> on the brighter display:<blockquote>In SDR content, brightness maxed out at 563 nits, which confirms Apple's assertion of a 20 percent boost compared to the previous generation. Switching to HDR content, we hit a maximum of 1539 nits with 40 percent coverage, compared to 1,470 nits for the older model.</blockquote><h2>Video Reviews</h2><br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Last week, Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/30/apple-announces-m3-macbook-pros/">updated the 24-inch iMac</a>, with the headline upgrade being the M3 chip for significantly improved performance. Other new features include Wi-Fi 6E, Bluetooth 5.3, and up to 24GB of unified memory.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/iMac-M3-Blue-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-917291" /><br/>
<br/>
The new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/">iMac</a> can be purchased from the Apple's online store, with prices starting at &#36;1,299. Apple began accepting orders on October 30, and new &zwnj;iMac&zwnj; will begin arriving to customers and launch in stores on Tuesday, November 7.<br/>
<br/>
<ul><li><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m1-vs-m3-imac/">M1 vs. M3 iMac Buyer's Guide: 15+ Differences Compared</a></li></ul><br/>
<br/>
Ahead of time, the first reviews of the laptops have been shared by select media outlets and YouTube channels, and we have rounded up some of them below.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Written Reviews</h2><br/>
<a href="https://www.techradar.com/computing/macs/apple-imac-24-inch-m3-review"><em>TechRadar</em></a>'s Matt Hanson pointed out the &zwnj;iMac&zwnj;'s <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/30/magic-accessories-still-feature-lightning/">continued use of Lightning ports</a> on its Magic Keyboard, Magic Trackpad, and Magic Mouse:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote>Sticking to the same design also brings back some old frustrations, such as the charging port on the bottom of the Magic Mouse, which means you can't use it while it's charging, plus a reliance on the increasingly obsolete Lightning connection for charging all of the peripherals, rather than getting with the times and using USB-C. </blockquote><br/>
<br/>
<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/11/06/apple-imac-m3-review/"><em>TechCrunch</em></a>'s Brian Heater downplayed the significance of the continued use of the Lightning port, but emphasised that it was time for Apple to move on:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote>Apple's desktop accessories are one of the few remaining vestiges of a connector that's past its prime. It largely won't bother you. There's less daily wear, as most people don't plug and unplug their keyboards and trackpads at the same rate they do their phones. Also, you're probably not going to get pocket lint jammed in there. Still, it's time for to Apple rip off the Band-Aid off, once and for all.</blockquote><br/>
<br/>
Early Geekbench 6 benchmark results indicated that the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/01/m3-chip-benchmark-results/">M3 chip is up to 40% faster than the M1</a> used in the previous &zwnj;iMac&zwnj; from 2021.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/apple-imac-m3-review/"><em>Digital Trends</em></a>'s Luke Larsen on the performance improvements delivered by the M3 chip:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote>Moving from the M1 to the M3 is a big jump. Even if you think the performance changes between each individual generation aren't too exciting, skipping one adds up to a noticeable difference.<br/>
<br/>
When you look at Cinebench R23 scores, the M3 is a whopping 20% faster in both single-core and multi-core. That's massive. It means no matter what the strenuous task is, the M3 iMac will be at least 20% faster. A good example is a simple video encoding test in Handbrake. The M3 iMac encoded the same video to H.265 27% faster than the M1 iMac.<br/>
<br/>
It shows how far Apple has taken these chips in just a few generations, especially on the GPU front. I was sent the 10-core GPU model, and with the inclusion of Dynamic Caching, this little iMac is a pretty solid little engine for graphics. In the Cinebench 2024 GPU test, it was 35% faster than the M1 Pro in a 14-inch MacBook Pro despite having six less GPU cores. Meanwhile, the M3 iMac beats the M2 Pro in the Mac mini by 20% in this same graphics test. Again, I think you can credit Dynamic Caching for doing a lot of the heavy lifting in that comparison.</blockquote><br/>
<br/>
The M3 chip is among Apple's first <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/3nm/">3nm</a> chips. The M3 chip features eight CPU cores like the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m1/">M1</a> chip, but it now offers an eight- or 10-core GPU, rather than the seven- or eight-core GPU of the &zwnj;M1&zwnj;. It also features a 4.05 GHz CPU clock speed, up from 3.20 GHz on the &zwnj;M1&zwnj; chip, more memory bandwidth, support for AV1 decode, and a new GPU architecture with Dynamic Caching, hardware-accelerated ray tracing, and hardware-accelerated mesh shading.<br/>
<br/>
<em><a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/desktops/apple-imac-2023">Tom's Hardware</a></em>'s Brandon Hill on the 2023 &zwnj;iMac&zwnj; as a whole:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote>The iMac has always been a reasonably economical system for Mac users who want "just the basics" in an everyday computer. The screen is large, bright, and colorful. The minimalist design blends in with just about any décor (and you can choose from various colors to match), and the new Apple M3 chip provides a big jump in performance compared to the M1 model that debuted in 2021.<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately, there are quite a few "gotchas" here. While the &#36;1,299 starting price is enticing, you're saddled with just 8GB of unified memory and a 256GB SSD. That's hardly enough to futureproof the iMac. A simple upgrade to 16GB of memory costs a staggering &#36;200, while storage upgrades are equally pricey.<br/>
<br/>
If you want Gigabit Ethernet, that's a &#36;30 upcharge, and you only get two Thunderbolt 4 ports on base systems. You must spend at least &#36;1,499 to get two Thunderbolt 4 ports and two USB 3 ports.<br/>
<br/>
Apple's iMac is an excellent all-in-one macOS machine, though it's in need of a rethink when it comes to its pricing and available configurations.</blockquote><br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple has <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/6/23947196/apple-no-27-inch-apple-silicon-imac">confirmed to <em>The Verge</em></a> and some other publications that it has no plans to release a new 27-inch iMac with Apple silicon.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/01/iMac-Pro-2022-27-and-24-iMac.jpg" alt="" width="1626" height="914" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-833952" /><br/>
Apple discontinued both the Intel-based 27-inch iMac and iMac Pro over the past two years, and it has yet to launch a larger-screen iMac with an Apple silicon chip as a replacement, leaving the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/30/apple-announces-imac-with-m3-chip/">recently-updated 24-inch iMac</a> with the M3 chip as its only all-in-one desktop computer. For customers who want a larger or higher-end desktop, Apple recommends pairing the 27-inch Studio Display with a Mac Studio or Mac mini.<br/>
<br/>
From the report:<blockquote>Apple will not be making an Apple Silicon version of the 27-inch iMac to replace the Intel-equipped model that it discontinued in 2022. The company is instead focusing the iMac line around the 24-inch model that was first released in early 2021 and just updated with the new M3 processor this fall.<br/>
<br/>
Apple PR representative Starlayne Meza confirmed the company's plans to The Verge. The company encourages those who have been holding out hope for a larger iMac to consider the Studio Display and Mac Studio or Mac mini.</blockquote>Apple has only ruled out a new 27-inch iMac, so a larger-screened iMac is still possible. Last month, <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman said Apple was still <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/23/new-32-inch-imac-pro-expected-2024-or-2025/">developing an iMac Pro with a 32-inch display</a> for release in late 2024 or in 2025.

		<description><![CDATA[Apple plans to update its entire iPad lineup throughout 2024, according to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2023-11-05/apple-vision-pro-plan-includes-launching-initially-just-at-apple-stores-in-2024"><em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman</a>. This means new models of the iPad Pro, iPad Air, iPad mini, and entry-level iPad can be expected to launch next year.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/M3-iPad-Feature-3.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-917548" /><br/>
Gurman touched on the lack of new iPads and AirPods heading into the holiday shopping season in the latest edition of his <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2023-11-05/apple-vision-pro-plan-includes-launching-initially-just-at-apple-stores-in-2024"><em>Power On</em> newsletter</a>:<blockquote>Apple could have tried to rush out more new products, but revamped iPads and AirPods aren’t yet ready. The company plans to update its entire iPad lineup during 2024. New low-end AirPods are coming next year as well, with a refreshed Pro model following in 2025.</blockquote>2023 is expected to be the first year without any new iPads released since Apple first unveiled the device in 2010, so updates to all models next year sounds likely.<br/>
<br/>
When each iPad model was last updated:<ul><li><strong>iPad Pro:</strong> October 2022</li><br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's new M3 Pro chip with a 12-core CPU offers only marginally faster CPU performance compared to the M2 Pro chip with a 12-core CPU, according to a <a href="https://browser.geekbench.com/v6/cpu/3390128">Geekbench 6 result</a> spotted today by <a href="https://twitter.com/VadimYuryev/status/1720982471062491428">Vadim Yuryev</a>, co-host of the YouTube channel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/maxtechofficial">Max Tech</a>. This is only a single benchmark result, so further results are needed to ensure accuracy.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/M3-Pro-Chip-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1405" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-921224" /><br/>
Apple announced <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/30/apple-announces-m3-macbook-pros/">new 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models</a> with M3, M3 Pro, and M3 Max chips on Monday. This benchmark result <a href="https://twitter.com/aaronp613/status/1719775450963095885">appears to be</a> for the 14-inch model, based on the "Mac15,6" model identifier listed.<br/>
<br/>
The result shows the M3 Pro has a single-core score of 3,035 and a multi-core score of 15,173. If these scores are accurate, the M3 Pro is up to 14% faster than the M2 Pro in terms of single-core performance, but only up to 6% faster <a href="https://browser.geekbench.com/macs/macbook-pro-14-inch-2023-m2-pro-12c-cpu">in terms of multi-core performance</a> for the most demanding tasks and workflows.<br/>
<br/>
Both the M2 Pro and M3 Pro are equipped with up to a 12-core CPU, but the M3 Pro has only six high-performance cores and six efficiency cores, while the M2 Pro has eight high-performance cores and four efficiency cores. So while the M3 Pro is manufactured with TSMC's 3nm process, compared to 5nm for the M2 Pro, the chip's resulting performance gains are diminished due to it having two fewer performance cores. The M3 Pro also has <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/31/apple-m3-pro-less-memory-bandwidth/">25% less memory bandwidth</a> and one fewer GPU core compared to the M2 Pro.<br/>
<br/>
By limiting the M3 Pro's number of high-performance cores, Apple has created more differentiation between the M3 Pro and the M3 Max, which has up to 12 high-performance cores. However, as a result, the M3 Pro is only marginally faster than the M2 Pro.<br/>
<br/>
Geekbench 6 results from earlier this week showed that the M3 Max is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/01/m3-max-chip-benchmark-results/">up to 45% faster than the M2 Max</a>, while the standard M3 chip is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/01/m3-chip-benchmark-results/">up to 20% faster than the standard M2 chip</a>, so the M3 Pro is by far the least improved chip of the series. Of course, the M3 Pro is still a significant upgrade for those coming from an Intel-based Mac. M3 Pro is also up to 20% faster than the M1 Pro chip, which is a decent improvement.<br/>
<br/>
As always, benchmarks provide a useful reference point, but real-world performance can vary.<br/>
<br/>
The new MacBook Pro models are available to order now, and M3 and M3 Pro configurations will begin arriving to customers and launch in stores on Tuesday, November 7. M3 Max configurations will launch a few days later.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro/">MacBook Pro 14 & 16" </a></div><div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/geekbench/">Geekbench</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/benchmarks/">Benchmarks</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Pro_16">14" & 16" MacBook Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macbook-pro.90">MacBook Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/05/m3-pro-chip-benchmark-result/">M3 Pro Chip Barely Faster Than M2 Pro in Unverified Benchmark Result</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/m3-pro-chip-barely-faster-than-m2-pro-in-unverified-benchmark-result.2409903/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>
