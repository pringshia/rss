		<description><![CDATA[Amazon has nearly every model of the Aluminum Apple Watch Series 9 on sale at new record low prices in one of the first best Black Friday deals of the season. You can get the 41mm GPS model of the brand new smartwatch for <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0CHX5R8BP%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"><strong>&#36;349.00</strong></a>, down from &#36;399.00.<br/>
<br/>

When you click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment, which helps us keep the site running.</small></em><br/>
<br/>
Apple launched the Series 9 models back in September, and since then the steepest discounts have been about &#36;10-20. This makes Amazon's sale today a notable markdown and definitely one of the overall best seen so far during Black Friday 2023. It's available in all five Aluminum models, as well as in both S/M and M/L fits.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0CHX5R8BP%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"target="_blank"><div class="fancybutton"><div class="fancybadge">&#36;50 OFF</div>Apple Watch Series 9 (41mm GPS) for &#36;349.00</div></a></div><br/>
<br/>
Likewise, Amazon has the 45mm GPS Apple Watch Series 9 for <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0CHXF9R4Y%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1"><strong>&#36;379.00</strong></a>, down from &#36;429.00. It's also available in all five Aluminum color options, both S/M and M/L fits, and this is another record low price on the smartwatch.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0CHXF9R4Y%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1"target="_blank"><div class="fancybutton"><div class="fancybadge">&#36;50 OFF</div>Apple Watch Series 9 (45mm GPS) for &#36;379.00</div></a></div><br/>
<br/>
Cellular Apple Watch Series 9 deals are just as abundant on Amazon right now. You can get the 41mm Cellular model for <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0CHX94FM3%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1"><strong>&#36;449.00</strong></a> and the 45mm Cellular model for <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0CHX3T2TM%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1"><strong>&#36;479.00</strong></a>, both of which are &#36;50 discounts and all-time low prices. You'll again find all five Aluminum options on sale at these prices, as well as multiple size options.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[3D content has begun appearing in the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a> app ahead of next year's Vision Pro headset launch (via <em><a href="https://www.flatpanelshd.com/news.php?subaction=showfull&id=1699434273">FlatPanelsHD</a></em>).<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/3d-movies-apple-tv-app.jpg" alt="" width="2400" height="1443" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-921969" /><em>Screenshot of the &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj; showing the new 3D content icon (via <a href="https://www.flatpanelshd.com/news.php?subaction=showfull&id=1699434273">FlatPanelsHD</a>).</em></div><br/>
tvOS 17.2's redesigned &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj; app shows a large selection of movies with a small 3D icon that resembles a headset alongside other icons for the likes of Dolby Atmos and 4K. Since the movies are unplayable in 3D via the TV app without a Vision Pro headset, it is currently unclear what resolution and frame rate they play in. 3D titles seen in the &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj; app include <em>Jurassic World Dominion</em>, <em>Pacific Rim Uprising</em>, <em>Shrek</em>, <em>Trolls</em>, <em>Warcraft</em>, <em>Minions: The Rise of Gru</em>, <em>Mortal Engines</em>, <em>Everest</em>, <em>Kung Fu Panda 3</em>, and more.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">This 3D icon is live in the Apple TV app. <a href="https://t.co/EEKPRDVphx">https://t.co/EEKPRDVphx</a> <a href="https://t.co/PFvCiyj78B">https://t.co/PFvCiyj78B</a></p>&mdash; Steve Moser (@SteveMoser) <a href="https://twitter.com/SteveMoser/status/1722631501890900357?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 9, 2023</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div><br/>
<br/>
Apple showcased a 3D version of <em>Avatar: The Way of Water</em> to demonstrate some of the entertainment capabilities of the Vision Pro headset when it was unveiled in June and touted the ability to play 2D, 3D, and "immersive" movies on the device, including in a virtual cinema. Apple is also expected to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/06/12/apple-tv-monsterverse-spatial-video-vision-pro/">offer Apple TV+ content</a> in a new, immersive 3D video format, including <em>Monarch: Legacy of Monsters</em>.

		<description><![CDATA[Apple on Wednesday increased its estimated <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/trade-in">trade-in values</a> for select iPad and Apple Watch models in the U.S., according to the company's website.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/iPad-Pro-and-Apple-Watch-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-921972" /><br/>
Apple increased trade-in values for the iPad Pro, iPad Air, entry-level iPad, Apple Watch Ultra, and Apple Watch Series 7, which could incentivize customers to upgrade these devices heading into the holiday shopping season. Trade-in values for iPhones, Macs, and other iPad and Apple Watch models did not change at this time.<br/>
<br/>
Apple's trade-in changes are outlined below:<br/>
<table class="comparison"><br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Encrypted messaging app <a href="https://signal.org">Signal</a> has <a href="https://community.signalusers.org/t/public-username-testing-staging-environment/56866">announced</a> it is testing public account usernames so that users don't have to share their phone number to connect through the service.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/signal-logo.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-921884" /><br/>
Currently, signing up to Signal requires that you share your phone number with other users when connecting with them. While the new method still requires an account to be associated with a number during setup, it is not subsequently shared when contacting other users, making the communication even more private and secure. <br/>
<br/>
According to Signal VP of engineering Jim O'Leary, the username test is currently limited to a separate build in the platform's Staging Environment and remains "pre-beta," so it may cause crashes and other bugs to occur since it fundamentally changes the way that accounts are identified in the Signal ecosystem. <br/>
<br/>
Users who install the build will be able to share their usernames via a QR code or a link, allowing them to use it as a way for others to contact them, no phone number required. There is also an option to turn off phone number discovery in the app under Settings ➝ Privacy ➝ Phone number ➝ Who can find my number.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Signal is testing username feature. This would mean that you would not have to provide your phone number to people you want to contact. You will be able to set your phone number as private and not share it. <a href="https://t.co/OUI2S8dEtp">pic.twitter.com/OUI2S8dEtp</a></p>&mdash; Lukasz Olejnik, Ph.D, LL.M (@lukOlejnik) <a href="https://twitter.com/lukOlejnik/status/1722349114304708669?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 8, 2023</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div><br/>
Signal has been working on usernames since at least 2019, but it is not known when the feature will be ready for primetime. Using the pre-beta build on desktop and iOS today requires some technical knowhow involving code compiling, more information about which can be found in the <a href="https://community.signalusers.org/t/public-username-testing-staging-environment/56866">Signal forums</a>. <div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/encryption/">Encryption</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/signal/">Signal</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/09/signal-private-messenger-tests-usernames/">Signal Tests Sharing Public Usernames in Place of Phone Numbers</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/signal-tests-sharing-public-usernames-in-place-of-phone-numbers.2410432/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple has suffered a setback in its €13 billion (&#36;14 billion) tax dispute with Brussels after an advisor to the EU's highest court said the company's victory in an earlier ruling should be thrown out (via <em><a href="https://www.ft.com/content/db2e63a1-9972-444f-9ae3-70bec32b020b">Financial Times</a></em>).<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2016/01/European-Commisssion.jpg" alt="" width="1080" height="719" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-484620" /><br/>
Giovanni Pitruzzella, advocate-general of the European Court of Justice (ECJ), said on Thursday that Apple's win in the EU General Court "should be set aside" because it is riddled with mistakes.<br/>
<br/>
While such opinions by advocates-general are non-binding, the top EU tribunal follows such advice in the majority of cases, and it is set to issue its binding ruling in the coming months.<br/>
<br/>
In 2020, the General Court said it supported the EU's right to investigate national tax arrangements, but it ultimately overturned a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2016/08/30/apple-repay-14-5-billion-back-taxes-ec-rules/">ruling</a> by the European Commission stating that Apple should pay €13 billion euros in tax to the Irish government. <br/>
<br/>
Following <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2019/09/16/luca-maestri-to-challenge-apple-irish-tax-ruling/">Apple's appeal</a>, the EU's second-highest court said the EU authority, led by antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager, had <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2020/07/15/apple-wins-euro-tax-bill-court-appeal/">failed to show</a> that Apple had received an illegal economic advantage in Ireland over tax.<br/>
<br/>
Four years earlier, Apple CEO <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tim-cook/">Tim Cook</a> called the EC's original decision "<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2016/09/01/tim-cook-tax-total-political-crap/">total political crap</a>" and said that Apple believed it would be <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2016/08/30/tim-cook-open-letter-tax-evasion/">reversed</a>. "The decision is wrong, and it's not based on law or facts, it's based on politics. And I think it's very important that we stand up and say that very loudly," said Cook at the time.<br/>
<br/>
However, Pitruzzella said on Thursday the General Court ruling had "committed a series of errors" and "failed to assess correctly the substance and consequences of certain methodological errors." Pitruzzella said the court needed "to carry out a new assessment" as a result.<br/>
<br/>
Responding to the opinion of the advocates-general, Apple said on Thursday that the lower court "was very clear that Apple received no selective advantage and no State aid, and we believe that should be upheld."<br/>
<br/>
An ECJ ruling is expected next year.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/european-union/">European Union</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/european-commission/">European Commission</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-ireland-tax-case/">Apple-Ireland Tax Case</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/09/apple-could-pay-ireland-eu-tax-dispute/">Apple Could Pay &#039;Total Political Crap&#039; &#36;14 Billion Tax Bill to EU After All</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-could-pay-total-political-crap-14-billion-tax-bill-to-eu-after-all.2410427/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple at WWDC 2024 will reveal a turbo-charged version of Siri powered by large language models (LLMs) that will debut in iOS 18, but some new cutting-edge generative AI features could be exclusive to iPhone 16 models, according to a new rumor.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/iPhone-16-Side-2-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="3532" height="1986" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-913688" /><br/>
Last month, <em>Bloomberg</em> reporter Mark Gurman revealed that Apple is developing a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/22/apple-generative-ai-features-and-smarter-siri/">large array of features that use generative AI</a>, including a "smarter version of Siri" and new LLM-based AI features that will be baked into iOS 18 and iPadOS 18.<br/>
<br/>
Gurman said Apple was still debating whether to limit generative AI to on-device processing, deploy it via the cloud, or adopt a hybrid approach combining the two. It was not mentioned either way whether some AI features would require specific hardware architecture or trickle down to all models capable of running iOS 18. <br/>
<br/>
However, according to new information independently shared by the leaker <a href="https://x.com/Tech_Reve/status/1722418466647625999?s=20">@Tech_Reve</a>, iOS 18 will bring the company's new LLM to millions of existing devices by using cloud-based AI, while new on-device AI features will likely remain exclusive to the iPhone 16.<br/>
<br/>
In terms of iOS 18 features, Gurman's sources mention a revamped interaction between ‌Siri‌ and the Messages app, enabling users to field complex questions and auto-complete sentences more effectively. We may also see auto-generated Apple Music playlists and integration with productivity apps like Pages and Keynote, such as AI-assisted writing and slide deck creation. Where this patina of AI integration crosses over into new hardware requirements is still unknown.<br/>
<br/>
Apple is designing new A-series chips for the iPhone 16 lineup, built on TSMC's latest N3E 3-nanometer node. Efficiency and performance improvements are of course expected, but there could be other benefits that feed into Apple's AI intentions. Notably, TSMC is the sole manufacturer for Nvidia's powerful H100 and A100 AI processors, the hardware that powers AI tools like ChatGPT and which also comprises the majority of AI data centers.<br/>
<br/>
All models in the iPhone 16 series are also <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/31/iphone-16-extra-button-rumor/">rumored to have an extra button</a> that we don't know the purpose of yet. Internal versions of the iPhone 16 that Apple is working on include an extra capacitive button, known internally as the "Capture Button." <br/>
<br/>
The button is located on the same side as the Power button, and is a capacitive button that is able to detect pressure and touch, providing haptic feedback when pressed. There has been no word yet on what this button might be used for, but it could conceivably have unforeseen practical AI applications.<br/>
<br/>
Apple is said to be on course to spend &#36;1 billion per year on AI research, with some of the company's biggest executive names overseeing development, including senior vice president of software engineering Craig Federighi, senior vice president of machine learning and AI strategy John Giannandrea, and senior vice president of services Eddy Cue.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/artificial-intelligence/">Artificial Intelligence</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/revegnus/">Revegnus</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-gpt/">Apple GPT</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ios-18/">iOS 18</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/09/iphone-16-exclusive-ai-features-ios-18/">iPhone 16 Models on Course for Exclusive AI Features Coming in iOS 18</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-16-models-on-course-for-exclusive-ai-features-coming-in-ios-18.2410420/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Disney <a href="https://thewaltdisneycompany.com/disneys-fiscal-full-year-and-q4-2023-earnings-results-webcast/">today said</a> that it will soon combine Disney+ and Hulu into one streaming service, with a unified app to be available in a beta capacity next month.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/disney.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-909605" /><br/>
Disney CEO Bob Iger <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/11/disney-plus-hulu-combo-app/">first announced plans</a> to merge Hulu and Disney+ into a single app earlier this year. The app will first be offered to those who subscribe to the Disney+ and Hulu bundle, providing those customers with one app to access all their content. Right now, Disney offers a combined bundle that features Disney+ and Hulu, but subscribers need to download two separate apps. Pricing for the app has not been announced, but the current ad-supported Hulu and Disney+ bundle costs &#36;9.99 per month, while the version without ads costs &#36;19.99 per month.<br/>
<br/>
During today's fourth quarter earnings call, Iger confirmed that Disney is on track to roll out the unified app in the United States starting in December, with an official launch to follow in spring 2024.<br/>
<br/>
Disney earlier this month said that it will pay Comcast over &#36;8 billion to purchase Comcast's Hulu shares, which would see Disney being the sole owner of Hulu and will allow for the combined app.<br/>
<br/>
Disney in October increased the price of both Disney+ and Hulu in an effort to bring in more revenue. Ad-free Disney+ is now priced at &#36;13.99 per month, while ad-free Hulu costs &#36;17.99 per month.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/disney/">Disney</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/hulu/">Hulu</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/disney-plus/">Disney Plus</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/08/disney-plus-hulu-combo-app-2/">Disney+ and Hulu Merging Into Single App, Beta Coming in December</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/disney-and-hulu-merging-into-single-app-beta-coming-in-december.2410365/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[LG and Samsung plan to begin mass production of OLED display panels for the next-generation iPad Pro models around February 2024, according to a report today from <a href="https://biz.chosun.com/it-science/ict/2023/11/08/ARI7VWL4TZDMZKCRI2NZ2AKS3Y/">South Korea's <em>Chosun Ilbo</em></a>. The news was highlighted by the <a href="https://www.oled-info.com/chosun-lgd-and-sdc-will-produce-10-million-amoled-displays-apples-ipads-next">website <em>OLED-Info</em></a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/07/iPad-Pro-OLED-Feature-2.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-853666" /><br/>
<em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman expects new 11-inch and 13-inch iPad Pro models with <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/03/gurman-new-ipad-magic-keyboard-to-feature-aluminum/">OLED displays, an M3 chip, and an aluminum Magic Keyboard</a> to launch next year. With mass production of the OLED displays reportedly not beginning until February, it seems unlikely that the next iPad Pro models would be ready to launch in March, a common month for Apple to announce new products. It seems more likely that the next iPad Pro models would be announced at WWDC in June or later, but Apple's plans could still change.<br/>
<br/>
The current iPad Pro models are equipped with LCD panels, and the 12.9-inch model also features mini-LED backlighting for increased brightness and a higher contrast ratio. OLED technology would eliminate the need for backlighting, with benefits including even higher contrast ratio with deeper blacks, lower power consumption, and more. Apple is expected to use <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/17/ipad-pro-2024-oled-hybrid-tech/">very thin hybrid OLED displays</a> with a combination of flexible and rigid materials, which could allow for the next iPad Pro models to be slightly thinner.<br/>
<br/>
There have been rumors about the iPad Pro adopting OLED technology for several years, and it seems that it will finally happen next year. The next iPad Air, iPad mini, and entry-level iPad are all expected to stick with LCD panels.<br/>
<br/>
Apple last updated the iPad Pro line in October 2022, with key new features at the time including the M2 chip, Wi-Fi 6E and Bluetooth 5.3 support, hover functionality for the second-generation Apple Pencil, and support for ProRes video recording.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/oled-ipad-pro/">OLED iPad Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#11-iPad-Pro">11" iPad Pro (Caution)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#12-9-iPad-Pro">12.9" iPad Pro (Caution)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipad.137">iPad</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/08/ipad-pro-oled-display-production-february-report/">iPad Pro OLED Display Production Reportedly to Begin Around February</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ipad-pro-oled-display-production-reportedly-to-begin-around-february.2410359/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Popular accessory maker Nomad today announced the launch of three new products that are designed for use in vehicles. The Mount, Charge Mount, and 70W Car Charger offer charging and mounting solutions for the car.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/nomad-car-mount-charger.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-921798" /><br/>
<a href="https://nomadgoods.com/products/mount-black">Priced at &#36;45</a>, the Mount is a simple MagSafe-compatible accessory that is designed to attach to horizontal and vertical vehicle vents. It features a slim design with a polycarbonate and glass body. As this is just a mount, it does not offer in-car charging.<br/>
<br/>
The <a href="https://nomadgoods.com/products/charge-mount-black">&#36;80 Charge Mount</a> has the same design as the Mount, but it comes with a USB-C cable and an 18W USB-C Car Charger. It is able to charge an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> at up to 7.5W and it works with any of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe-battery-pack/">MagSafe</a> iPhones.<br/>
<br/>
Nomad's &#36;60 <a href="https://nomadgoods.com/products/car-charger-70w-usb-c">70W Car Charger</a> plugs into the 12V socket in the car and offers two USB-C ports for charging iPhones and even Macs. The full 70W is available to a single device if only one USB-C port is in use, otherwise the power is split between the two devices (50W to the blue port and 20W to the other port). The Car Charger features GaN technology for a slim build, but it does not come with USB-C cables so you will need to supply your own.<br/>
<br/>

Capcom <a href="https://www.capcom-games.com/apple/en-us/">updated its website</a> with the launch date this week.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-913940" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/resident-evil-4.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="720" /><br/>
Resident Evil 4 is one of the console games that can be played on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a> models with A17 Pro chip. The A17 Pro chip features hardware-accelerated ray tracing and improved GPU capabilities that make console-quality gaming possible.<br/>
<br/>
The title will be playable on the &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj;, the &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; Max, iPads that are equipped with an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m1/">M1</a> or later, and all Apple silicon Macs. <br/>
<br/>
Capcom plans to charge &#36;59.99 for Resident Evil 4 on the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPad&zwnj;, which is the same price as the game on consoles like the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X. Additional DLC content like new areas and weapon packs will be available at prices ranging from &#36;2.99 to &#36;19.99.<br/>
<br/>
Capcom released the Resident Evil 4 remake on PlayStation, Xbox, and PC in March. Compared to the original 2005 title, the updated version includes overhauled graphics, new characters, and updated gameplay elements like crafting items and ammo from resources.<br/>
<br/>
Pre-orders for Resident Evil 4 are <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/resident-evil-4/id6462360082?platform=iphone">available on the App Store</a>, and Capcom says that there will be a demo available for those who want to try the game out before buying.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/08/resident-evil-4-apple-december-20/">Resident Evil 4 Coming to iPhone, iPad and Mac on December 20</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/resident-evil-4-coming-to-iphone-ipad-and-mac-on-december-20.2410323/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[As the end of 2023 approaches, now is a good opportunity to look back at some of the devices and accessories that Apple discontinued throughout the year.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/5-Products-Apple-Discontinued-in-2023-Feature-1.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-921716" /><br/>
Apple products discontinued in 2023 include the iPhone 13 mini, 13-inch MacBook Pro, MagSafe Battery Pack, MagSafe Duo Charger, and leather accessories.<br/>
<br/>
Also check out our lists of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/11/09/apple-discontinued-products-2022/">Apple products discontinued in 2022</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/12/29/5-products-discontinued-by-apple-in-2021/">2021</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>iPhone Mini</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/iPhone-12-Mini.jpeg" alt="" width="1400" height="787" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-921759" /><br/>
Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/12/apple-discontinues-iphone-13-mini/">discontinued the iPhone 13 mini</a> in September after introducing the iPhone 15 series, and this marked the end of the iPhone mini entirely, although a <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/FG8W3LL/A/refurbished-iphone-12-mini-256gb-green-unlocked">refurbished iPhone 12 mini</a> remains available on Apple's online store in the U.S. for now.<br/>
<br/>
Equipped with a 5.4-inch display with slim bezels, the iPhone mini was a favorite among fans of smaller smartphones, but market research firms said the model had <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/04/21/iphone-13-mini-unpopular-march-quarter/">low sales relative to other iPhone models</a>. Apple decided not to release an iPhone 14 mini last year, but it had kept the iPhone 13 mini available as a lower-cost option.<br/>
<br/>
The smallest iPhone that Apple sells brand new is now the iPhone SE with a 4.7-inch display, but it has a very outdated design with a Home button and thicker bezels, and the next iPhone SE is rumored to have a larger 6.1-inch display.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>13-Inch MacBook Pro</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/07/Touch-Bar-13-Inch-MacBook-Pro.jpg" alt="" width="1364" height="769" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-853221" /><br/>
Apple finally <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/30/apple-discontinues-13-inch-macbook-pro/">discontinued the 13-inch MacBook Pro</a> last week following its "Scary Fast" event. The laptop had a seven-year-old design, and it was the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/31/touch-bar-discontinued/">final Mac equipped with a Touch Bar</a> instead of physical function keys.<br/>
<br/>
The 13-inch MacBook Pro was effectively replaced with the new entry-level 14-inch MacBook Pro with the standard M3 chip, although the former started at &#36;1,299 and the latter starts at &#36;1,599. The 14-inch model does offer several upgrades over the 13-inch model, such as the M3 chip, a 120Hz ProMotion display, a 1080p camera, and more ports.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>MagSafe Battery Pack</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/07/magsafe-battery-pack-feature2.jpg" alt="" width="2490" height="1401" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-807787" /><br/>
Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/12/apple-discontinues-magsafe-battery-pack-and-duo/">discontinued the MagSafe Battery Pack</a> in September after introducing the iPhone 15 series. <br/>
<br/>
Released in 2021, the ‌MagSafe Battery Pack‌ was priced at &#36;99 and attaches magnetically to the back of the iPhone 12 and newer, providing hours of additional battery life. While all iPhone 15 models are now equipped with a USB-C port, the battery pack has a Lightning charging port, so it effectively became outdated.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>MagSafe Duo Charger</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/11/magsafe-duo-perspective-feature.jpg" alt="" width="1332" height="750" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-770700" /><br/>
Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/12/apple-discontinues-magsafe-battery-pack-and-duo/">discontinued the MagSafe Duo Charger</a> in September after introducing the iPhone 15 series.<br/>
<br/>
Released in 2020, the MagSafe Duo Charger was a &#36;129 foldable charging mat with both a MagSafe charger for iPhones and an Apple Watch magnetic charging puck. Like the MagSafe Battery Pack, it had a Lightning charging port.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Leather Accessories</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/02/apple-leather-wallet-magsafe.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-784716" /><br/>
Apple stopped selling leather accessories in September, including leather versions of iPhone cases, the MagSafe Wallet, Apple Watch bands, and more, as part of the company's environmental responsibility efforts. Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/12/apple-announces-finewoven/">introduced a new FineWoven fabric material for accessories</a> that it says has a "significantly lower" carbon footprint than leather, but customers have complained about the new iPhone cases <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/25/finewoven-iphone-case-continued-criticism/">being prone to scratches and stains</a>. <br/>
<br/>
<h3>Honorable Mentions</h3><br/>
Apple also <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/31/apple-discontinues-itunes-movie-trailers-app/">discontinued its iTunes Movie Trailers app</a> and the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/01/apple-music-voice-plan-no-longer-available/">Apple Music Voice Plan</a> this year.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/08/apple-discontinued-these-5-products-in-2023/">Apple Discontinued These 5 Products in 2023</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-discontinued-these-5-products-in-2023.2410313/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2023/11/taylor-swift-is-apple-musics-artist-of-the-year-for-2023/">announced</a> that Taylor Swift has been named Apple Music's Artist of the Year for 2023 after reaching "a new realm of superstardom this year."<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/Taylor-Swift-2023-Apple-Music-Artist-of-Year.jpg" alt="" width="1960" height="1102" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-921741" /><br/>
Swift released a new album last month called <em>1989 (Taylor's Version)</em>, and she has been on tour this year. Apple says in the first 10 months of 2023, Swift had 65 songs reach Apple Music's Global Daily Top 100, which was more than any other artist.<br/>
<br/>
"I am so honored to be Apple Music's Artist of the Year," said Swift. "Thank you to every single one of you for making this year the most incredible, joyful, celebratory year ever. From streaming the music nonstop to screaming it together in real life at the shows, dancing chaotically in movie theaters, none of this would have been possible without you. Thank you so much."<br/>
<br/>
"Taylor Swift's impact on music is absolutely undeniable — not just this record-breaking year, but throughout her entire career," said Oliver Schusser, Apple's vice president of Apple Music and Beats. "She is a generation-defining artist and a true change agent in the music industry, and there is no doubt that her impact and influence will be felt for years to come. We are thrilled to have the opportunity to celebrate her achievements."<br/>
<br/>
Swift will receive a physical Apple Music Award featuring Apple's custom 12-inch silicon wafer.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/">Apple Music</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/08/taylor-swift-apple-musics-artist-of-the-year/">Taylor Swift Named Apple Music&#039;s Artist of the Year</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/taylor-swift-named-apple-musics-artist-of-the-year.2410303/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[In 2022, Apple updated the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/">MacBook Air</a> with a complete redesign and the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m2/">M2</a> chip, followed by an all-new 15-inch version this year, so how do the two product lines compare to its latest MacBook Pro models with M3 chips?<br/>
<br/>

Despite now being similar in appearance, the &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; and the MacBook Pro are very different machines, so should you consider purchasing the 13- or 15-inch &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj;, which start at &#36;1,099, to save money, or do you need one of the higher-end 14- or 16-inch MacBook Pro models, which cost at least &#36;500 more? Our guide helps to answer the question of how to decide which of these two popular Apple silicon machines is best for you.<br/>

Both the &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; and MacBook Pro share the same basic design with a flat top and rounded edges on the bottom, but they do have several minor details that differ. For example, while both MacBooks have displays with a "notch" at the top to facilitate the built-in webcam, the MacBook Pro's bezels are noticeably slimmer. The keyboard area of the high-end MacBook Pro is also all-black.<br/>
<br/>

The &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; and M3 version of the MacBook Pro are available in Silver and Space Gray, but the &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; is also offered in Starlight and Midnight color options, so if you are looking for a particular aesthetic with one of these finishes, you will need to get the &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj;. Space Black is exclusive to the MacBook Pro with the M3 Pro and M3 Max chips.<br/>

<div class="clear"></div><br/>
<br/>
Dimensions are also a key area of difference between the &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; and MacBook Pro. The 16-inch MacBook Pro is considerably larger and heavier than the 15-inch &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj;, but it is important to not understate the difference between the 14-inch MacBook Pro and the 13-inch &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj;. While the 14-inch MacBook Pro offers a larger display than the &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj;, its marginally larger footprint, added thickness, and an additional 0.8 pounds of weight do make for a noticeably less portable machine if you prefer to travel light.<br/>
<br/>
Even so, the 14-inch MacBook Pro offers a very good balance of portability and performance, so if you need its added capabilities, its size and weight should not hold you back. The 15-inch &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; also provides a good balance of portability and display area, but users wary of its size should opt for the 13-inch model.<br/>
<br/>
<h3 id="ports_and_connectivity">Ports and Connectivity</h3><br/>
The selection of ports is an area of major difference between the two machines. The &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; features just two Thunderbolt ports, while the M3 version of the MacBook Pro adds an HDMI 2.1 port and SDXC card slot. When configured with the M3 Pro or M3 Max, the MacBook Pro has a total of three Thunderbolt 4 ports, in addition to its HDMI 2.1 port and SDXC card slot. Both machines feature a 3.5mm headphone jack with support for high-impedance headphones.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/10/2021-macbook-pro-ports.jpg" alt="" width="1952" height="1156" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-821474" /><br/>
All in all, the MacBook Pro is much more versatile in terms of connectivity, even possessing newer Bluetooth and Wi-Fi specifications, offering useful features for professionals who use SDXC cards from digital cameras or even simply more USB peripherals.<br/>
<br/>
<h3 id="display_size">Display Size</h3><br/>
The smaller &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj;'s display is 13.6 inches in size, which is a little smaller than the 14.2-inch MacBook Pro, and markedly smaller than the 16.2-inch MacBook Pro. 13.6 inches is still bigger than the largest <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a> model, which comes in at 12.9 inches, and even all of the previous &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; and smaller MacBook Pro models, meaning that it should be adequate for most users. The 14.2-inch MacBook Pro simply offers a little bit more screen real estate to those who need high-end capabilities.<br/>
<br/>
The 15.3-inch &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; and 16.2-inch MacBook Pro's displays will be better replacements for a desktop machine and provide much more screen space to arrange multiple windows and use professional applications that benefit from additional display area.<br/>
<br/>
<h3 id="display_technology">Display Technology</h3><br/>
The display technologies of both machines are significantly different. Like most MacBooks in recent years, the &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; has an LCD panel, but owing to its slim bezels and rounded corners, Apple calls it a Liquid Retina display. The 14- and 16-inch MacBook Pro models feature Apple's more advanced mini-LED Liquid Retina XDR technology for deeper blacks, better dynamic range, and improved color accuracy.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/10/macbook-pro-display.jpg" alt="" width="1960" height="1274" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-821240" /><br/>
The XDR display can get much brighter, reaching as high as 1,600 nits of brightness at its peak when showing HDR content. The 14- and 16-inch MacBook Pro models also have ProMotion displays, allowing them to vary their refresh rate up to 120Hz. The &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; does not have a display with a variable refresh rate.<br/>
<br/>
It will be worth getting the high-end MacBook Pro models for viewing and editing HDR content, as well as watching high-framerate video such as sports. The display of the &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; is sufficient for most users and some may not even notice a drastic difference. The MacBook Pro's deeper blacks and smoother on-screen motion simply offer a slightly better experience.<br/>
<br/>
<h3 id="chips">Chips</h3><br/>
The &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; contains the &zwnj;M2&zwnj; chip, while MacBook Pro customers can choose between the M3, M3 Pro, and M3 Max chips. The M3 Pro and M3 Max are scaled-up versions of the M3 chip that offer additional CPU and GPU cores. See the &zwnj;M2&zwnj;, M3, M3 Pro, and M3 Max's Geekbench 5 Benchmark scores below:<br/>
<br/>
<table class="comparison"><br/>
 <tr><br/>

 <td>3,120</td><br/>
 <td>3,120</td><br/>
 </tr><br/>
 <tr><br/>
 <th>Multi-Core</th><br/>
 <td>9,630–9,650</td><br/>
 <td>11,763</td><br/>
 <td>14,010–14,410</td><br/>
 <td>19,160–21,215</td><br/>
 </tr><br/>
 <tr><br/>
 <th>Metal (Graphics)</th><br/>
 <td>41,300–45,550</td><br/>
 <td>47,430</td><br/>
 <td>68,330–77,070</td><br/>
 <td>124,060–157,120</td><br/>
 </tr><br/>
</table><br/>
<div class="clear"></div><br/>
<br/>
The M3 Pro and M3 Max provide CPUs with up to eight additional cores and GPUs with up to 30 additional cores. The &zwnj;M2&zwnj; chip in the &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; is only slightly less powerful than the M3, M3 Pro, and M3 Max in single-core tasks, but the M3 chips, and particularly the Pro and Max versions, are considerably better in multi-core and graphics tasks.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/07/Apple-M3-chip-series-architecture.jpg" alt="" width="2400" height="1350" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-920045" /><br/>
With significantly more transistors, performance CPU cores, and GPU cores, the M3 Pro and M3 Max are powerful chips designed for professionals with demanding workflows. The &zwnj;M2&zwnj; and M3, on the other hand, are more consumer-oriented chips focused on delivering surprisingly impressive performance and excellent efficiency to keep temperatures down and prolong battery life.<br/>
<br/>
It is also worth noting that the &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; is passively cooled and contains no fan, which can slightly constrain peak performance compared to the MacBook Pro, since the high-end machines have large fans to actively cool the system and push the chips harder.<br/>
<br/>
The limitations of the &zwnj;M2&zwnj; and M3 also mean that &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; and MacBook Pro devices configured with these chips support only one external display, whereas M3 Pro and M3 Max machines support up to two and four external displays, respectively.<br/>
<br/>
<h3 id="memory_and_storage">Memory and Storage</h3><br/>
The &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; can be configured with up to 24GB of unified memory and up to 2TB of storage, which should be more than enough for the vast majority of users. For those who need even more memory and storage, the MacBook Pro can be configured with significantly more memory and storage than the top-spec &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
The M3 Pro and M3 Max chips in the MacBook Pro also provide up to 150GB/s and 400GB/s memory bandwidth respectively – an enormous increase over the 100GB/s memory bandwidth with the &zwnj;M2&zwnj; chip in the &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
Buyers should also be aware that the 256GB &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; base models have up to 50 percent slower SSDs than configurations with more storage. This is because the base models only have a single SSD module inside, whereas models with larger amounts of storage have two SSD chips, significantly increasing the overall speed of the machine's storage.<br/>
<br/>
<h3 id="speakers_and_microphones">Speakers and Microphones</h3><br/>
The &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; has a four-speaker sound system that is surprisingly full and balanced for such a small, slim device. The MacBook Pro takes things to the next level with a high-fidelity six-speaker sound system with force-cancelling woofers for dramatically bigger and deeper audio – something that may be invaluable to users who work in professional audio production or simply listen to a lot of music out-loud.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2013/09/macbook-pro-speakers.jpg" alt="" width="1128" height="684" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-821784" /><br/>
The &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; has a three-mic array with directional beamforming that is perfect for activities like video calls and voice notes. The MacBook Pro has what Apple calls a "studio-quality" three-mic array with high signal-to-noise ratio and directional beamforming. While they are not as good as a dedicated microphone, the MacBook Pro's microphones are impressive and, at a push, are suitable for production purposes like podcasting.<br/>
<br/>
<h3 id="battery_life">Battery Life</h3><br/>
The &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; has an 18-hour battery life, offering the same battery life as the 14-inch MacBook Pro with the M3 Pro or M3 Max chips, and four hours less than the 14-inch MacBook Pro with the M3 chip and the 16-inch MacBook Pro. <br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="other_macbook_options">Other MacBook Options</h2><br/>
If you are looking for a more affordable Apple silicon MacBook, there is the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m1/">M1</a> &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj;, which sports a 13.3-inch Retina display, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/touch-id/">Touch ID</a>, two Thunderbolt ports, and more, for prices starting at &#36;999. For users on a strict budget, the &zwnj;M1&zwnj; &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; is still a good option.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="final_thoughts">Final Thoughts</h2><br/>
Overall, the &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; is the best option for casual users, offering an excellent balance of features and performance in a highly portable design. The &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj;'s &#36;1,099 starting price is much more affordable compared to the MacBook Pro, and with an education discount or an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/best-apple-deals/#macbook_air">offer from our Apple Deals Roundup</a>, it is possible to get that price down by at least &#36;100. The additional &#36;500 to get the MacBook Pro likely is not worth it for most ordinary users, and on the contrary, many will prefer the slimmer, lighter design of the &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; and perhaps even its additional color options.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2013/09/macbook-pro-sizes-space-gray.jpg" alt="" width="1500" height="693" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-821783" /><br/>
Professionals who require larger and more accurate displays, additional ports, more memory and storage, and a very high level of performance should look to the 14- and 16-inch MacBook Pro with the M3 Pro and M3 Max chips, and the higher price points of these machines reflects this. The high-end MacBook Pro models are not targeted at everyday consumers, being clearly tailored to creatives and professionals who rely heavily on the capabilities of their machines. As such, these high-end models should only be a go-to option if you are a power-user or professional who can make use of its advanced features. The 16-inch MacBook Pro, in particular, is also potentially a good desktop replacement machine due to its large display.<br/>

</ul><br/>
<br/>
Alternatively, if you are already considering the &#36;1,299 15-inch &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj;, it may be worth paying more to get the M3 MacBook Pro. For just &#36;200 more, the M3 MacBook Pro offers a considerably better Liquid Retina XDR display with ProMotion, a more powerful chip with active cooling, four extra hours of battery life, better speakers and microphones, an HDMI port and SDXC card slot, and more. In fact, if you configure the 15-inch &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; with 512GB of storage to match the M3 MacBook Pro, there is only a &#36;100 between the two machines, so in this instance it is almost always worth getting the more powerful machine, unless maximizing screen size is your only priority.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/">MacBook Air</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro/">MacBook Pro 14 & 16" </a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#15-MacBook-Air">15" MacBook Air (Neutral)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Pro_16">14" & 16" MacBook Pro (Buy Now)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Air">13" MacBook Air (Don't Buy)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macbook-air.122">MacBook Air</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macbook-pro.90">MacBook Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/macbook-air-vs-macbook-pro-buyers-guide/">MacBook Air vs. MacBook Pro Buyer&#039;s Guide</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/macbook-air-vs-macbook-pro-buyers-guide.2378980/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[We're getting closer to Black Friday on November 24, and in this article we're taking a closer look at all of the best early Black Friday HomePod and HomePod mini discounts you can get right now. <br/>
<br/>

Of course, there is a chance that we could see better deals on these iPads arrive as Black Friday gets closer. This is a risk anyone has to take while shopping during the holidays, so with that in mind, many of the deals shared below are currently their best prices ever seen.

OWC has an ultra-rare discount on Apple's HomePod mini, priced at <a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-462641-11911660?url=https%3A%2F%2Feshop.macsales.com%2Fitem%2FApple%2F4Y5G2LLA%2F"><strong>&#36;78.99</strong></a>, down from &#36;99.00. OWC says that these are brand new HomePod mini speakers, but they are not shipped in their original retail packaging and instead come bulk packaged with a 90 day OWC fulfilled limited warranty.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/homepod-mini-bells.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-921661" /><div class="center-wrap"><em><strong>Note: These are in new condition but come in bulk packaging.</strong></em></div><br/>

<br/>
HomePod mini discounts this steep are so rare, the last time we tracked anything remotely in the ballpark of &#36;20 off was Black Friday 2022. OWC has every color on sale at this record low price, so if you've been waiting for a sale now is the time.<br/>
<br/>
If you want the upgraded second generation HomePod model, B&H Photo still has the best deal around. You can get both colors at <a href="https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1746861-REG/apple_mqj73ll_a_homepod_2nd_generation.html/kw/APHOMEPODMN/BI/2696/KBID/3612"><strong>&#36;279.99</strong></a>, down from &#36;299.00. Although this isn't a particularly big markdown on the 2023 speaker, it remains the best deal we've tracked to date.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[WhatsApp has <a href="https://engineering.fb.com/2023/11/08/security/whatsapp-calls-enhancing-security/">introduced</a> a new privacy feature that lets you hide your IP address from whoever you call over the encrypted communications platform. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/03/Whatsapp-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2250" height="1266" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-786421" /><br/>
As it stands, one-to-one calls over WhatsApp are established as a direct peer-to-peer connection between users. While this ensures the best possible voice quality, it means the connected devices must reveal their IP addresses to each other. <br/>
<br/>
According to WhatsApp, the new privacy setting introduced today works differently by relaying all of your calls through WhatsApp's servers to obfuscate your location, rather than connecting you directly to the person you are calling. Meta engineers elaborated on the feature in a <a href="https://engineering.fb.com/2023/11/08/security/whatsapp-calls-enhancing-security/">blog post</a>:<br/>
<blockquote>Most calling products people use today have peer-to-peer connections between participants. This direct connection allows for faster data transfers and better call quality, but it also means that participants need to know each other’s IP addresses so that call data packets can be delivered to the correct device – meaning that the IP addresses are visible to both callers on a 1:1 call. IP addresses may contain information that some of our most privacy-conscious users are mindful of, such as broad geographical location or internet provider.<br/>
<br/>
To address this concern, we introduced a new feature on WhatsApp that allows you to protect your IP address during calls. With this feature enabled, all your calls will be relayed through WhatsApp’s servers, ensuring that other parties in the call cannot see your IP address and subsequently deduce your general geographical location. </blockquote><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/WhatsApp-Calls_image.jpg" alt="" width="863" height="550" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-921648" /><br/>
<br/>
At the same time, all relayed calls through WhatsApp's servers remain end-to-end encrypted, so no-one – not even WhatsApp – can listen to them.<br/>
<br/>
Before you consider using the new call relay privacy setting, WhatsApp says to bear in mind that call quality might be reduced as a result. To enable the setting, make sure you have updated to the latest version of WhatsApp, then follow these steps.<br/>
<ol><li>In WhatsApp, tap <strong>Settings ➝ Privacy</strong>.</li><br/>
<li>Tap <strong>Advanced</strong>.</li><br/>
<li>Toggle on the switch next to <strong>Protect IP address in calls</strong>.</li></ol><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/whatsapp-privacy-ip-address.jpg" alt="whatsapp" width="4137" height="2716" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-921670" /><br/>
<br/>
Note that group calls are always relayed through WhatsApp's servers by default. <br/>
<br/>
In June, WhatsApp added a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/silence-unknown-callers-whatsapp/">Silence Unknown Callers feature</a> for the encrypted messaging platform. Like the similar option in iOS, the feature is designed to automatically screen out spam, scams, and calls from unknown people for increased protection.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/whatsapp/">WhatsApp</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/privacy/">Privacy</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/08/whatsapp-hide-your-ip-address-during-calls/">WhatsApp Now Lets You Hide Your IP Address During Calls</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/whatsapp-now-lets-you-hide-your-ip-address-during-calls.2410293/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/07/apple-releases-macos-sonoma-14-1-1/">released macOS Sonoma 14.1.1</a> on Tuesday with "important bug fixes." While the release notes did not specify which bugs were fixed, we have confirmed that the update resolves a software update issue with M3 Macs and an Adobe Photoshop bug.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/No-13-Inch-M3-MacBook-Pro-Feature-2.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-921296" /><br/>
At least some 14-inch MacBook Pro and iMac models equipped with the standard M3 chip shipped with an unreleased build of macOS Ventura 13.5 installed, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/07/14-inch-macbook-pro-m3-macos-sonoma-update-issue/">macOS 14.1 was not showing up as an available software update</a> in the System Settings app. Fortunately, it is now possible to update these Macs to macOS 14.1.1. MacBook Pro models with the M3 Pro and M3 Max chips were not affected by this issue.<br/>
<br/>
macOS 14.1.1 also <a href="https://community.adobe.com/t5/photoshop-ecosystem-bugs/p-macos-14-1-photoshop-2024-v25-0-25-1-toolbar-click-through-issue/idc-p/14218733#M95503">fixes a bug</a> that prevented users from clicking on a section of the toolbar in Photoshop on macOS 14.1, as <a href="https://twitter.com/JonyIveParody/status/1722236152718283246">noted by @JonyIveParody on X</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Apple also released macOS Ventura 13.6.2 with bug fixes. The update resolves an issue where 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models with Apple silicon chips "start up to a black screen or circled exclamation point after the built-in display's default refresh rate is changed," according to an <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT213327">Apple support document</a>.<br/>
<br/>
macOS 14.1.1 and macOS 13.6.2 <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201222">do not have any published security patches</a>, despite Apple's release notes saying each update includes security fixes.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sonoma/">macOS Sonoma</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macos-ventura.239">macOS Ventura</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macos-sonoma.243">macOS Sonoma</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/08/macos-14-1-1-bug-fixes/">macOS 14.1.1 Fixes M3 Mac Upgrade Issue and Photoshop Bug</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/macos-14-1-1-fixes-m3-mac-upgrade-issue-and-photoshop-bug.2410289/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2023/11/apples-swift-student-challenge-to-open-in-2024-with-new-category/">announced</a> that it plans to hold its next Swift Student Challenge in February 2024, marking the first time the company has provided advanced notice to give students time to prepare. The Swift Student Challenge tasks students with creating an innovative coding project using the Swift Playgrounds app.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/swift-student-challenge-2024.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-921665" /><br/>
This year's Swift Student Challenge will have 350 winners, and there will be a category that recognizes a total of 50 Distinguished Winners for standout submissions. All of the Distinguished Winners will be invited to Apple's headquarters in Cupertino, California, where they will be able to connect with their peers and the Apple team, while all winners will be granted a free one-year membership in the Apple Developer program.<blockquote>"At Apple, we believe that everyone can learn to code and build apps, and we're proud to support and recognize aspiring student developers with the Swift Student Challenge each year," said Susan Prescott, Apple's vice president of Worldwide Developer Relations and Education & Enterprise Marketing. "We know that students are eager to learn coding skills to solve challenges they care about -- whether it's building an app to help peers identify mental health resources or supporting sustainability efforts on campus -- and want to know how to get started. Apple is releasing new coding resources for students and educators, working with our community partners on dedicated Swift programming, and sharing advance notice of the Swift Student Challenge timeline for 2024. We can't wait to see the app playgrounds students submit next year."</blockquote><br/>
Apple has been holding an annual Swift Student Challenge for several years now, but it is typically announced when the dates for WWDC are announced, and past winners have been invited to attend the Worldwide Developers Conference. Apple says that this year's 50 Distinguished Winners will be invited to Cupertino "next summer."<br/>
<br/>
Starting in February 2024, students will have three weeks to submit their app playgrounds to Apple. Apple judges entries on technical accomplishment, creativity of ideas, and content of written responses explaining the project. Students can sign up on the Apple Developer website to be <a href="https://developer.apple.com/swift-student-challenge/">notified when submissions open</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Along with the Swift Student Challenge, Apple is launching for new Everyone Can Code projects that students can use to learn to create apps and refine their app development skills. The new projects task students with designing a simple app, building with stacks and shapes, building custom shapes, and designing an app icon.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/swift/">Swift</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-developer-program/">Apple Developer Program</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/08/swift-student-challenge-february-2024/">Apple to Launch Next Swift Student Challenge in February 2024</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-to-launch-next-swift-student-challenge-in-february-2024.2410286/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>
