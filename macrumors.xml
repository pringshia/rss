		<description><![CDATA[Sales of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a> will soon begin in countries outside of the United States, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-05-13/apple-set-to-sell-vision-pro-headset-internationally-for-first-time">reports <em>Bloomberg</em></a>. Hundreds of employees from international retail stores have been flying into Cupertino for multi-day Vision Pro training sessions.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/Apple-Vision-Pro-with-battery-Feature-Orange.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-898552" /><br/>
Apple held similar training sessions ahead of when the Vision Pro launched in the United States, with employees learning how to provide customer demonstrations and answer customer questions. An exact launch date for the Vision Pro hasn't yet been announced, but it is expected to expand to additional countries after WWDC. This year's Worldwide Developers Conference is set to take place from June 10 to June 14.<br/>
<br/>
Employees from stores in Australia, China, Germany, France, Japan, South Korea, and Singapore are attending the training sessions, so these are likely to be the first countries to get the Vision Pro after the United States. Apple analyst <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/">Ming-Chi Kuo</a> <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/28/kuo-on-apple-vision-pro-wider-launch/">previously said</a> the Vision Pro would launch in more countries prior to WWDC, but that may now be inaccurate with <em>Bloomberg</em>'s information suggesting a June debut.<br/>
<br/>
U.S. interest in the Vision Pro <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/22/apple-vision-pro-customer-interest-dying-down/">has died down</a> in the months following the launch of the device, and Apple has allegedly <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/23/apple-cuts-vision-pro-shipments/">cut Vision Pro shipments</a> as a result. International sales could bring a renewed wave of excitement over the device, but at &#36;3,500 USD, the price is still prohibitive. Pricing in non-U.S. countries has not yet been announced.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AppleVisionPro">Vision Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-vision-pro.209">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/13/vision-pro-expanded-launch-after-wwdc/">Apple to Expand Vision Pro to Additional Countries After WWDC</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-to-expand-vision-pro-to-additional-countries-after-wwdc.2426197/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[AppleCare+ has long offered iPhone screen repairs for &#36;29 in the U.S., and this option is <a href="https://support.apple.com/ipad/repair">now available for the new iPad Pro and iPad Air models</a> too.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/M4-iPad-Pro-and-Air-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-950313" /><br/>
Apple says the &#36;29 screen repair option is limited to the 11-inch and 13-inch iPad Pro models with the M4 chip, and the 11-inch and 13-inch iPad Air models with the M2 chip, and the devices must have no other damage in order to qualify.<br/>
<br/>
For any other damage to the new iPad Pro and iPad Air, AppleCare+ charges a &#36;99 fee. For previous-generation models, Apple charges &#36;49 for screen repairs or any other damage if the device has AppleCare+ coverage.<br/>
<br/>
As usual, skipping AppleCare could prove to be costly, with Apple charging between &#36;449 and &#36;999 for uncovered repairs of the devices.<br/>
<br/>
Here is how much AppleCare+ costs for the new iPads:<br/>
<br/>
<ul><li><strong>13-inch iPad Pro:</strong> &#36;169 or &#36;8.49 per month</li><br/>
<li><strong>11-inch iPad Pro:</strong> &#36;149 or &#36;7.49 per month</li><br/>
<li><strong>13-inch iPad Air:</strong> &#36;99 or &#36;4.99 per month</li><br/>
<li><strong>11-inch iPad Air:</strong> &#36;79 or &#36;3.99 per month</li></ul><br/>
<br/>
The new iPad Pro and iPad Air models are available to order now and launch on May 15.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2024/05/apple-music-celebrates-the-launch-of-inaugural-100-best-albums-list/">announced</a> a new 10-day event counting down the 100 best albums of all time, as judged by <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/">Apple Music</a> experts and a select group of artists. The event will see &zwnj;Apple Music&zwnj; revealing 10 albums from the list per day alongside a <a href="https://100best.music.apple.com/">new microsite</a> featuring analysis of each album, interviews, and more.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/apple-music-100-best-albums.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-950376" /><br/>
<blockquote>"Putting this list together was a true labor of love, both in that it was incredibly difficult to do and in that we are all so passionate about it," said Zane Lowe, Apple Music's global creative director and lead anchor for Apple Music 1. "We were tasked with selecting the 100 best — that's practically mission impossible. But as music fans, it was also amazing to really take a minute and sit and think about the music and albums and artists that we love so much in this context. If this list sparks more debate among fans outside of Apple Music and gets people talking passionately about the music they love, then we've done what we set out to do."</blockquote>The first 10 albums from the list revealed today include:<br/>
<br/>
<strong>100.</strong> <em>Body Talk</em>, Robyn<br/>
<strong>99.</strong> <em>Hotel California</em>, Eagles<br/>
<strong>98.</strong> <em>ASTROWORLD</em>, Travis Scott<br/>
<strong>97.</strong> <em>Rage Against the Machine</em>, Rage Against the Machine<br/>
<strong>96.</strong> <em>Pure Heroine</em>, Lorde<br/>
<strong>95.</strong> <em>Confessions</em>, USHER<br/>
<strong>94.</strong> <em>Untrue</em>, Burial<br/>
<strong>93.</strong> <em>A Seat at the Table</em>, Solange<br/>
<strong>92.</strong> <em>Flower Boy</em>, Tyler, The Creator<br/>
<strong>91.</strong> <em>Listen Without Prejudice Vol. 1</em>, George Michael<br/>
<br/>
The countdown event will also include a takeover of the &zwnj;Apple Music&zwnj; Hits station on &zwnj;Apple Music&zwnj; Radio, featuring specials with various &zwnj;Apple Music&zwnj; Radio hosts and ongoing features, plus exclusive on-demand content drops on &zwnj;Apple Music&zwnj; and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-podcasts/">Apple Podcasts</a>. The event will culminate in a roundtable discussion among artists Nile Rodgers and Maggie Rodgers alongside &zwnj;Apple Music&zwnj; hosts Zane Lowe and Ebro Darden as the top 10 albums are revealed on Wednesday, May 22.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/">Apple Music</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/13/apple-music-100-best-albums/">Apple Music Counting Down 100 Best Albums of All Time</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-music-counting-down-100-best-albums-of-all-time.2426182/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple last week <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/07/everything-announced-may-7-event/">announced</a> a new raft of iPad Pro and iPad Air models, but news about a new iPad mini was conspicuous by its absence. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/09/iPad-mini-review-thumb.jpg" alt="" width="4114" height="2314" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-818321" /><br/>
Apple has not updated the iPad mini since 2021, so it is certainly ripe for a refresh, but fans of the smaller 8.3-inch device will have to wait a while longer for a seventh-generation model, according to <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman.<br/>
<br/>
Writing in his latest <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-05-12/who-will-run-apple-after-cook-leaves-a-look-at-company-s-succession-challenge-lw3j2t5z">Power On newsletter</a>, Gurman cautioned his readers not to expect a new iPad mini model "until the end of this year at the earliest." In other words, don't get your hopes up for an iPad mini 7 announcement during Apple's upcoming Worldwide Developers Conference in June.<br/>
<br/>
Gurman expects the next iPad model to feature a newer processor, but few other changes. Other sources have <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apples-2024-ipad-mini-all-the-rumors-so-far/">claimed</a> new camera upgrades could be included, as well as a potential fix for the "<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/13/jelly-scrolling-reduced-on-ipad-mini-7/">jelly scrolling</a>" display behavior on the latest model.<br/>
<br/>
Gurman previously said that a new entry-level iPad model is similarly unlikely to make an appearance before late 2024 at the earliest. The current low-end iPad was last updated in October 2022.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-mini/">iPad mini</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPad_Mini">iPad Mini (Don't Buy)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipad.137">iPad</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/13/ipad-mini-7-not-expected-before-late-2024/">Next iPad Mini Still Not Expected Before Late 2024 at the Earliest</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/next-ipad-mini-still-not-expected-before-late-2024-at-the-earliest.2426177/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[<a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/gamma-game-emulator/id6499106870?platform=iphone">Gamma</a>, a new emulator for playing classic PlayStation 1 games on iPhone and iPad, has just hit the App Store. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/gamma-emulator-ios.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-950357" /><br/>
Developed by Benjamin Stark, aka ZodTTD, Gamma features customizable onscreen controller skins, and includes support for Bluetooth controllers as well as wired and non-wired keyboards.<br/>
<br/>
Similar to the fantastically popular <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/17/delta-game-emulator-iphone/">Delta emulator</a>, the Gamma app uses third-party cloud syncing services for backing up game files and save states, and also downloads game cover artwork. <br/>
<br/>
Fortunately for PS1 fans, Gamma does not require BIOS files to run games, although some users have reported a few issues getting some ROMs to run smoothly, but bug fixes are likely coming soon.

		<description><![CDATA[Apple has closed in on a deal with OpenAI that should see ChatGPT being used to power new features in its next iPhone operating system, according to <em>Bloomberg</em>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/iOS-18-WWDC-24-Feature-2.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-944197" /><br/>
In a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-05-11/apple-closes-in-on-deal-with-openai-to-put-chatgpt-on-iphone">report</a> over the weekend, <em>Bloomberg</em> claimed that the two companies have been "finalizing terms for a pact to use ChatGPT features in Apple's iOS 18." How the popular chatbot would integrate with Apple's software is not yet known. <br/>
<br/>
The agreement would see ChatGPT become another tool in a range of AI features that Apple is expected to bring to iPhones. Apple is also said to be in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/18/apple-google-gemini-ios-18-iphone/">ongoing talks</a> with Google to license its Gemini chatbot, but those discussions have not reportedly led to an agreement. Apple is known to have been in talks with OpenAI since <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/21/apple-iphone-ai-talks-google-openai-ongoing/">February</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Apple at its annual Worldwide Developers Conference next month is expected to announce <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/13/apple-says-ios-18-ambitious-compelling/">several AI features</a> coming to iOS 18, which is said to be one of the biggest upgrades to the iPhone operating system in years. According to Haitong analyst Jeff Pu, Apple plans to run some of the features on data servers <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/06/apple-building-m2-ultra-and-m4-servers/">powered by its own in-house chips</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Apple CEO Tim Cook confirmed in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/28/tim-cook-apple-generative-ai-break-new-ground/">February</a> that Apple plans to "break new ground" in AI. <em>Bloomberg</em> reporter Mark Gurman has previously <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/15/apple-engineers-working-on-chatgpt-like-ai/">reported</a> that Apple is also working on its own chatbot tool that some engineers have dubbed "Apple GPT" to rival OpenAI's ChatGPT.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a></div><div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/bloomberg-com/">Bloomberg</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/artificial-intelligence/">Artificial Intelligence</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/chatgpt/">ChatGPT</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-gpt/">Apple GPT</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/13/apple-finalizing-deal-openai-chatgpt-ios-18/">Apple Wrapping Up OpenAI Deal to Bring ChatGPT Features to iOS 18</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-wrapping-up-openai-deal-to-bring-chatgpt-features-to-ios-18.2426171/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Sonos this week <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/23/redesigned-sonos-app/">released a major redesign</a> for the Sonos app, introducing customizable home screen meant to deliver a personalized listening experience. The update was announced back in April, but just went live, and unfortunately, it removes a number of features while also introducing several bugs.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/04/sonos-redesigned-app.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-947528" /><br/>
Multiple <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/sonos/comments/1co6iy2/the_new_sonos_app_feedback_megathread/">complaints on social media</a> have <a href="https://en.community.sonos.com/ask-a-question-228987/how-to-rollback-to-s2-6892340">called the app</a> a "step back" with missing features like editing a song queue, managing playlists, shuffling a music library, and setting alarms and timers, along with slow performance and hard-to-access system controls. There has also been feedback from users about missing accessibility features.<br/>
<br/>
<em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/9/24152675/sonos-new-app-bad-reviews-response-statement">The Verge</a></em> asked Sonos about the negative feedback, and in response, Sonos said that it's aware of the complaints, but "it takes courage" to rebuild a core product.<blockquote>Redesigning the Sonos app is an ambitious undertaking that represents just how seriously we are committed to invention and re-invention. It takes courage to rebuild a brand's core product from the ground up, and to do so knowing it may require taking a few steps back to ultimately leap into the future.<br/>
<br/>
The app's revitalization not only aims to address what customers have been asking us for in the short-term, but is also critical for supporting the exciting innovations to come from Sonos in the years ahead.<br/>
<br/>
We realize there are beloved features our listeners are eager to continue enjoying now. We are working diligently to reintroduce them in the coming months, alongside additional enhancements that will make for an even better app experience.<br/>
<br/>
This is just the beginning of an exciting new chapter for Sonos as we continue to expand the way listeners can access and enjoy all the content they love in a more personalized and seamless way. We have always and will continue to listen to customer feedback so we can create sound experiences that well exceed both our standards and the standards of our listeners.</blockquote>Sonos said that it is working to address the missing features "in the coming months," and the update will ultimately lead to "exciting innovations" in the years to come. There is no way for iOS customers who have already upgraded their apps to go back to the prior version, though users are calling for Sonos to roll back the update until the new app is more fully fleshed out.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/sonos/">Sonos</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/10/sonos-said-rolling-out-widely-criticized-app-redesign-took-courage/">Sonos Said Rolling Out Widely Criticized App Redesign Took &#039;Courage&#039;</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/sonos-said-rolling-out-widely-criticized-app-redesign-took-courage.2425990/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[TikTok <a href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/partnering-with-our-industry-to-advance-ai-transparency-and-literacy">this week announced</a> that it has started automatically labeling AI-generated content created on third-party platforms, preventing AI images and videos from confusing and misleading viewers.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/08/tiktok-logo.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-752609" /><br/>
Content made using TikTok's AI creation tools has included an AI label for more than a year, but going forward, TikTok will also label AI images made through other platforms. TikTok's tool will read Content Credentials, a technology from the Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity (C2PA). Content Credentials are designed to attach metadata to AI content, facilitating AI labeling.<br/>
<br/>
TikTok's AI labeling started rolling out today on images and videos, and it will soon be coming to audio-only content. Content created with AI will have a label that says "AI-generated" under an account's TikTok username.<br/>
<br/>
Labeling may be gradual, as content needs to have Content Credentials included for it to be identified and labeled. As other platforms adopt credentials, AI identification will increase across all social networks.<br/>
<br/>
In the future, TikTok will add Content Credentials to TikTok content that will remain when images and videos are downloaded, so people and other social networks can use the C2PA Verify tools to identify AI content that was made on TikTok.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tiktok/">TikTok</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/10/tiktok-label-ai-generated-content/">TikTok Becomes First Social Network to Auto Label AI-Generated Content</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/tiktok-becomes-first-social-network-to-auto-label-ai-generated-content.2425982/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's shift to develop its own AI technology to keep up with competitors was today detailed in a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/10/business/apple-siri-ai-chatgpt.html"><em>The New York Times</em></a> report.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/04/Apple-Silicon-AI-Optimized-Feature-Siri-1.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-947754" /><br/>
Citing sources familiar with Apple's work, the report explains that the decision to revamp <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a> was taken early last year by Apple's most senior executives. Senior vice president of software engineering Craig Federighi and senior vice president of Machine Learning and AI Strategy John Giannandrea are said to have spent several weeks testing OpenAI's ChatGPT to understand the ways in which the competitor made &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; look antiquated. The &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; team purportedly failed to receive attention and resources compared to other groups inside Apple, and the company has struggled to recruit and retain leading AI researchers.<br/>
<br/>
Apple executives are said to be concerned that AI threatens the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>'s market share because it has the potential to become a more compelling operating system with an ecosystem of AI apps that undermine the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a>. Apple apparently fears the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; becoming a "dumb brick" compared with other technology.<br/>
<br/>
This conclusion triggered a significant reorganization at Apple amid determination to catch up in the race to develop AI tools. The company moved to reallocate employees and resources toward AI, and the change of strategy was a contributing factor in the decision to cancel its electric vehicle project. Apple's upcoming <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a> models will supposedly feature more memory to support AI features.<br/>
<ul><li><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/18/should-apple-kill-siri/">Should Apple Kill Siri and Start Over?</a></li></ul><br/>
Apple is expected to reveal a series of AI tools at its WWDC keynote on June 10, including an improved version of &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; that is more conversational and capable, with the ability to "chat" rather than merely respond to individual queries. The company is working on making &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; better at handling tasks such as setting timers, creating calendar appointments, adding items to Reminders, and summarizing text. Apple plans to market the new version of &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; as a more private alternative to rival AI services because most requests will be processed on-device rather than remotely in data centres.

		<description><![CDATA[If your <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> regularly runs out of battery later in the day, Low Power Mode is one way to make it last longer. You can also make Low Power Mode automatically turn on when your battery reaches a certain custom level. Keep reading to learn how.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/low-power-mode.jpg" alt="low power mode" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-950287" /><br/>
Most &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; users are familiar with the way iOS throws up a prompt to turn on Low Power Mode when the battery reaches 20%. Low Power Mode can also be turned on manually at any time by going to <strong>Settings -> Battery</strong> and toggling on the switch next to <strong>Low Power Mode</strong>.<br/>
<br/>
If you find yourself constantly having to turn on Low Power Mode late in the day, you can save some time by setting it up to run automatically when your battery is depleted to a specific custom level. This can be done in the Shortcuts app, as the following steps show.<br/>
<br/>
Bear in mind that Low Power Mode reduces your &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;'s performance and cuts out some background activities. For example, mail must be fetched manually, background app refresh is disabled, and motion and brightness are reduced.<br/>
<br/>
If you're okay with those limitations, follow the steps below to automate the setting on your &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;.<br/>
<ol><li>Open the <strong>Shortcuts</strong> app and select the <strong>Automation</strong> tab at the bottom of the screen, then tap the <strong>+</strong> button in the top-right corner.</li><br/>
<li>Scroll down and select <strong>Battery Level</strong> from the options.</li><br/>

<li>Check <strong>Falls Below 50%</strong> and then drag the slider to adjust the percentage level for when Low Power Mode should be activated.</li><br/>
<li><li>To ensure the automation runs in the background, toggle off the switch next to <strong>Ask Before Running</strong>, then tap <strong>Next</strong>.</li><br/>
<li>Search for "Set Low Power Mode" and select the card from the results, then tap <strong>Next</strong>.</li><br/>
<li>Lastly, tap <strong>Done</strong> in the top-right of the screen.</li><br/>

		<description><![CDATA[The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/">iPhone 16 Pro</a> may feature a display that is up to 20% brighter for typical SDR content, according to the Weibo leaker known as "<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/instant-digital/">Instant Digital</a>." <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/Apple-iPhone-15-Pro-lineup-Action-button-230912.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-910375" /><br/>
In a recent post, the Weibo user claimed that the &zwnj;iPhone 16 Pro&zwnj; will feature up to 1,200 nits of typical SDR brightness – a 20% increase over the current models. Peak HDR brightness will apparently remain the same at 1,600 nits.<br/>
<br/>
The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-14/">iPhone 14</a> Pro touted a significant increase in brightness over its predecessor, featuring up to 400 nits higher HDR brightness. However, the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>'s typical SDR brightness has been the same at 1,000 nits since the introduction of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-13/">iPhone 13</a> Pro in 2021. The &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;'s typical SDR is used in the majority of situations, so a 20% increase in standard brightness would be a significant upgrade.<br/>
<br/>
Instant Digital has a mixed <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/instant-digital/">track record for Apple rumors</a>, but has provided some strikingly accurate information, such as the imminent launch of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/03/iphone-14-new-color-rumor/">2023's Yellow iPhone 14</a>, the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/17/iphone-15-and-15-plus-frosted-glass-rumor/">frosted back glass</a> of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a> and &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; Plus, the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch/">Apple Watch Series 9</a> <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/04/apple-watch-series-9-basically-unchanged/">as a minor refresh</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/04/future-iphone-could-capture-spatial-photos-videos/">spatial video capture</a> on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a>, the new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/">iPad Air</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a>'s <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/08/ipad-air-ipad-pro-landscape-facetime-camera/">landscape front-facing camera</a>, and the &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj;'s new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/20/new-ipad-pro-to-gain-matte-option/">nano-texture display option</a>.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a> will include new audio transcription features in the Voice Memos and Notes apps, according to information obtained <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/24/05/10/apple-set-to-deliver-ai-assistant-for-transcribing-summarizing-meetings-and-lectures">by <em>AppleInsider</em></a>.<br/>

The report claims that transcriptions of audio recordings will be available in both the Voice Memos and Notes apps on iOS 18. In addition, the Notes app will apparently be able to provide AI-generated summaries of key points in audio recordings. These features are also expected to be included in iPadOS 18 and macOS 15.<br/>

<em>AppleInsider</em> previously reported that the Calendar and Reminders apps and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/17/ios-18-notes-app-voice-memos-math-rumors/">Calculator and Notes apps will be integrated</a> on iOS 18, and said that the update will include <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/30/safari-ai-features-coming-in-ios-18/">new Safari features such as "Intelligent Search" and "Web Eraser."</a> We recently <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/30/ios-18-rumor-recap-for-apps/">recapped iOS 18 rumors on a per-app basis</a>, with new features also expected for Apple Music, Messages, and more.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[WhatsApp is receiving a refreshed design on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> and Android, the first interface overhaul of its kind since 2021.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/whatsapp-new-design.jpg" alt="" width="3840" height="2160" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-950251" /><br/>
The new design rolling out for the Meta-owned social media platform is meant to be fresh, approachable, and simple, <a href="https://design.facebook.com/stories/whatsapp-user-interface-update/">according to WhatsApp</a>.<br/>
<br/>
WhatsApp says that sending photos and videos on iOS is now easier, thanks to a new attachment layout. Instead of a full screen menu, there's an expandable tray for accessing features when sending media, documents, polls, and more. <br/>
<br/>
Icons have been updated to a rounded, outlined style, and there are new illustrations with added animations for a "more playful" aesthetic.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/whatsapp-attachment-tray.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="880" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-950252" /><div class="center-wrap"><em>New WhatsApp attachment tray</em></div><br/>
There's also a new "consistent" green color palette throughout the app, as well as a new dark mode that's one shade darker, which aims to reduce eye strain in low-light environments.<br/>
<br/>
The new changes are rolling out to WhatsApp users on &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; and Android now, according to the company. <div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/whatsapp/">WhatsApp</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/10/whatsapp-for-iphone-android-new-design/">WhatsApp Gets Overhauled Interface Design and New Attachment Tray</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/whatsapp-gets-overhauled-interface-design-and-new-attachment-tray.2425958/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[When introducing the new M4 <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a> models, Apple showed a video of a hydraulic press crushing all manner of creative tools, including musical instruments, electronic equipment, arcade games, paint and brushes, computers, cameras, and more, with the aim of demonstrating how the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> represents all of the tools condensed into a single device.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe title="Crush! iPad Pro Apple" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ntjkwIXWtrc" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div><br/>
The ad was a play on the popular hydraulic press videos that are popular across social media sites, but creatives found the concept to be in poor taste. Actor Hugh Grant <a href="https://twitter.com/HackedOffHugh/status/1788183871504204257">referred to the ad</a> as the "destruction of the human experience," director Reed Morano told Apple to "read the room" and called it "actually psychotic," and Basecamp CTO David Heinemeier Hansson <a href="https://world.hey.com/dhh/hating-apple-goes-mainstream-fe740007">said it</a> "symbolizes everything everyone has ever hated about digitization."<br/>
<br/>

The upset over the Crush ad led Apple to issue an apology. In a <a href="https://adage.com/article/digital-marketing-ad-tech-news/apple-apologizes-ipad-pro-crushed-ad-it-missed-mark/2559321">statement to <em>Ad Age</em></a>, Apple marketing vice president Tor Myhren said that the video ultimately "missed the mark."<blockquote>Creativity is in our DNA at Apple, and it's incredibly important to us to design products that empower creatives all over the world. Our goal is to always celebrate the myriad of ways users express themselves and bring their ideas to life through iPad. We missed the mark with this video, and we're sorry.</blockquote>Apple left the Crush video on its YouTube channel, but the ad won't be running on television.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-ads/">Apple Ads</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/10/apple-crush-ad-apology/">Apple Apologizes for &#039;Crush&#039; iPad Pro Ad, Won&#039;t Put It on TV</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-apologizes-for-crush-ipad-pro-ad-wont-put-it-on-tv.2425951/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<title>iPad Pro&#039;s M4 Chip Outperforms M3 by Up to 25%</title>

		<description><![CDATA[Benchmarks for the new M4 <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a> models have <a href="https://browser.geekbench.com/search?page=1&amp;q=iPad16%2C6&amp;utf8=✓">popped up on Geekbench</a>, giving us an idea of how much faster Apple's second-generation 3-nanometer chips are compared to the M3, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m2/">M2</a>, and other prior-generation Apple silicon chips.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/iPad-Pro-M4-Silver-and-Space-Black-Feature-Purple.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-949561" /><br/>
The 10-core variant of the M4 chip earned an average single-core score of 3,695 and an average multi-core score of 14,550 across 10 benchmarks. When it comes to single-core performance, the M4 is faster than the M3 Max MacBook Pro, and it's comparable to the &zwnj;M2&zwnj; Max in multi-core performance.<br/>
<br/>
For context, here are the single-core and multi-core scores of prior chips (all max CPU/GPU variants):<br/>
<ul><br/>
 	<li><strong>M4</strong> - 3,695/14,550</li><br/>
 	<li><strong>A17 Pro</strong> - 2,908/7,234</li><br/>
 	<li><strong>M2</strong> - 2,540/9,360</li><br/>
 	<li><strong>M2 Pro</strong> - 2,651/14,295</li><br/>
 	<li><strong>M2 Max</strong> - 2,802/14,800</li><br/>
 	<li><strong>M1</strong> - 2,272/8,208</li><br/>
 	<li><strong>M3</strong> - 3,087/11,702</li><br/>
 	<li><strong>M3 Pro</strong> - 3,112/15,286</li><br/>
 	<li><strong>M3 Max</strong> - 3,128/20,957</li><br/>
</ul><br/>
Compared to the &zwnj;M2&zwnj; in the prior version of the &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj;, the M4 is 46 percent faster when it comes to single-core performance, and 55 percent faster in multi-core performance. Apple didn't use the M3 in an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>, but it is up to 24 percent faster than the M3.<br/>
<br/>
Apple said that the M4 delivers up to 1.5x faster CPU performance than the &zwnj;M2&zwnj; in the prior-generation &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj;, which is accurate based on the benchmarks we've seen so far.<br/>
<br/>
Apple plans to bring the M4 chip family to all of its products across 2024 and 2025, with the first M4 Macs slated for later this year.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPad-Pro">iPad Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipad.137">iPad</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/10/m4-ipad-pro-cpu-benchmark/">iPad Pro&#039;s M4 Chip Outperforms M3 by Up to 25%</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ipad-pros-m4-chip-outperforms-m3-by-up-to-25.2425947/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

<br/>

This means the 13-inch iPad Air's peak brightness is equal to the previous-generation iPad Pro models with the M2 chip for standard dynamic range (SDR) content, but the new iPad Pro models have brighter OLED displays that can reach up to 1,000 nits for SDR content, and up to 1,600 nits for high dynamic range (HDR) content.<br/>
<br/>
Peak brightness levels (SDR) for recent iPad Pro and iPad Air models:<br/>
<br/>
<ul><li><strong>13-inch iPad Pro (M4):</strong> 1,000 nits</li><br/>
<li><strong>11-inch iPad Pro (M4):</strong> 1,000 nits</li><br/>
<li><strong>12.9-inch iPad Pro (M2):</strong> 600 nits</li><br/>
<li><strong>11-inch iPad Pro (M2):</strong> 600 nits</li><br/>
