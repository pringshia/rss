		<description><![CDATA[Apple uses a variety of test devices and prototypes when it is considering new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> features, and one such test device was recently discovered by <a href="https://x.com/AppleDemoYT">AppleDemoYT</a>, who shared a video today. This rare prototype &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; was originally sourced from a facility that recycles electronics.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MkDXU-h-KaY?si=28rquCBnd-x-UTIh" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><br/>
The "Vesica Piscis" &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; is unique because it doesn't have an Apple logo, and it instead a symbol that looks like two crescent moon shapes. It's a symbol that has been seen on prototype Apple devices before, specifically <a href="https://www.letemsvetemapplem.eu/en/2022/03/03/podivejte-se-jak-vypada-prototyp-lokalizatoru-airtag/">an early version</a> of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airtags/">AirTag</a>. The shape that Apple is using is a mathematical shape formed when two disks with the same radius intersect, called vesica piscis in latin. It's a symbol that has influenced everything from architecture to art.<br/>
<br/>
It appears to use components from the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 13 Pro and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-14/">iPhone 14</a> Pro, though it also has parts that belong to neither of those iPhones. There are  volume and power buttons that do not click when pressed. Apple is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/20/iphone-15-haptic-button-overview/">known to have worked on</a> buttons with haptic feedback for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a>, but it's not a feature that ever materialized.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/11/prototype-vesica-iphone-back.jpg" alt="" width="903" height="1127" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-976440" /><br/>
There is a single, combined volume button rather than separate buttons, and a modified SIM tray that is shorter than normal and secured with screws. Engraving on the volume button side suggests that the device was at a "Ranger" prototype stage and was used for field testing.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/11/prototype-vesica-iphone-side.jpg" alt="" width="1630" height="542" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-976442" /><br/>
Some of the internal components, such as the camera, are non-functional and appear to be placeholders, and there are a minimal number of internal cables connecting to the logic board. One cable connects to the charging port and another connects to the buttons on the device. The logic board itself has a unique layout that is a cross between the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 13 Pro and &zwnj;iPhone 14&zwnj; Pro.<br/>
<br/>
When turned on, the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; displays a message about microcontroller initialization being completed, and when connected to a Mac, it is labeled as "Bender," which seems to be a Futurama reference. It does not respond to input.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/11/prototype-vesica-iphone-internal.jpg" alt="" width="1192" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-976443" /><br/>
Based on the serial number, it appears the device was manufactured in May 2021, which predates the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 13 Pro. It does not seem to be an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 13 Pro prototype, though, because the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 13 Pro would have already been finalized. The camera bump is similar to the &zwnj;iPhone 14&zwnj; Pro, so it could be a 14 Pro, but the mix of components makes it difficult to identify.<br/>
<br/>
AppleDemoYT speculates that it is a test device for experimental features rather than a prototype for a specific &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; model, and it may have been designed to test haptic button technology.<br/>
<br/>
Whatever it was used for, the Frankenstein &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; provides an interesting look at some of the testing that Apple does when considering new features.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/09/iphone-prototype-haptic-buttons/">Rare iPhone Prototype Was Likely Used for Testing Haptic Button Technology</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/rare-iphone-prototype-was-likely-used-for-testing-haptic-button-technology.2442460/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Amazon today introduced a new price drop on the M2 MacBook Air with 16GB of RAM, specifically for the 13-inch model with 256GB of storage. You can get this computer for <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0DLHT9VXW%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26th%3D1%26geniuslink%3Dtrue"><strong>&#36;749.99</strong></a> in two colors, down from &#36;999.00.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/m2-macbook-air-candycane.jpg" alt="" width="1607" height="905" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-922930" /><em><small>Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with Amazon. When you click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment, which helps us keep the site running.</small></em><br/>
<br/>
This deal beats the previous low price by about &#36;50, and it requires you to clip an on-page coupon in order to see the final sale price. Amazon has the MacBook Air in Space Gray and Midnight at this price, and right now they're the only retailer offering it.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><em><strong>Note: You won't see the deal price until checkout.</strong></em></div><br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0DLHT9VXW%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26th%3D1%26geniuslink%3Dtrue"target="_blank"><div class="fancybutton"><div class="fancybadge">&#36;249 OFF</div>13-inch M2 MacBook Air (16GB/256GB) for &#36;749.99</div></a></div><br/>

Apple updated the MacBook Air lineup last week to start with 16GB of RAM, up from 8GB, and otherwise there have been no changes to the computer.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Quinn Nelson has shared a super informative teardown video for the new Mac mini on his YouTube channel Snazzy Labs, offering the most comprehensive look inside Apple's smallest computer ever that we have seen so far. Give it a watch below.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OYlF0NVXS70?si=iY4a29vmI7I20xhO" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><br/>
<br/>
Yesterday, we reported that the new Mac mini <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/08/m4-mac-mini-modular-storage/">features modular storage</a>, and YouTube channel dosdude1 has already opened up the base model and upgraded its storage capacity from 256GB to 1TB. The steps included removing the original NAND storage chips from the board with a heat gun, preparing the new NAND chips by reballing them, soldering the new NAND chips to the board, and restoring the Mac mini in DFU Mode.<br/>
<br/>
While those steps are impractical for the average customer, the video proves that storage in the new Mac mini can technically be upgraded without having to pay Apple's for overpriced storage upgrade options when ordering the computer.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[There's been a lot to catch up since last week's introduction of the M4 MacBook Pro, Mac mini, and iMac models, and we've learned more about the new machines as they've made their way into the hands of reviewers and now regular customers.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/11/top-stories-9nov2024a.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-976393" /><br/>
Apple is also rolling along on iOS 18.2 development with additional Apple Intelligence features, and it's now in public beta as well as developer beta ahead of an expected early December release. Read on below for all the details on these stories and more!<br/>
<br/>
<h2>M4 Pro Chip Benchmark Results Reveal an Extremely Impressive Performance Feat</h2><br/>
Ahead of the official launch of the M4 Macs, we began seeing some impressive benchmarks for the new chips. While we had some idea of the raw performance of the base M4 chip given its inclusion in the iPad Pro released earlier this year, the M4 Pro and M4 Max are brand-new higher-end chips with correspondingly better performance.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/10/M4-M4-Pro-vs-M4-Max-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-973089" /><br/>
The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/31/m4-pro-chip-benchmark-results/">M4 Pro tops even the M2 Ultra</a> in multi-core CPU performance, with the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/01/m4-max-chip-geekbench-benchmark-results/">M4 Max pushing things even further</a> with two additional CPU cores compared to the M4 Pro in their highest configurations. <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/01/m4-pro-m4-max-graphics-benchmarks/">On the graphics side</a>, the new M4 Max can't quite match the M2 Ultra with its 76-core GPU at the high end, but it comes pretty close and blows past the M3 Max.<br/>
<br/>
For a comparison of all of the M4 variants found in the latest Macs, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m4-vs-m4-pro-vs-m4-max/">be sure to check out our guide</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Mac Mini With M4 and M4 Pro Reviews: Smaller Design and Pro Performance Make for Major Upgrade</h2><br/>
With the new M4 Macs being announced around a week and a half of ahead of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/08/new-macs-now-available-for-apple-store-pickup/">their public launch</a>, media and YouTubers were able to get some early hands-on time with the new machines.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/11/m4-mini-hands-thumb-1.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-976392" /><br/>
Reviewers <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/review/mac-mini-with-m4-and-m4-pro/">appreciated the Mac mini's redesign</a> and beefed-up power, while the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/07/m4-macbook-pro-reviews-processor-benchmarks-impress-new-nano-texture-option-worth-the-extra/">MacBook Pro delivers solid spec improvements</a> and a fantastic new nano-texture display glass option. The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/review/m4-imac/">M4 iMac offers a similar nano-texture glass option</a>, a Center Stage camera, and updated colors.<br/>
<br/>
We've had a brief chance to go <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/08/m4-mac-mini-hands-on/">hands-on with the Mac mini</a> ourselves, and it's definitely an impressive upgrade in nearly every way.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Apple Silicon Unified Memory: How Much Mac RAM Do You Need?</h2><br/>
With all Macs now starting with at least 16GB of unified memory, it's worth considering how much you should opt for when choosing or configuring a new Mac for purchase. After all, memory can't be upgraded after purchase, so you need to get it right the first time.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/04/apple-silicon-feature-joeblue.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-945652" /><br/>
One of our latest guides <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/how-much-mac-ram/">walks through the various memory options</a> ranging from 16GB on consumer machines all the way up to a maximum of 192GB on the Mac Pro, so see where you fall based on the tasks you need your Mac to be able to accomplish.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Everything New in iOS 18.2 Beta 2</h2><br/>
Apple is continuing work on iOS 18.2 and related updates that are expected to officially launch in early December, and the latest beta seeded to developers and public beta testers this week <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/04/everything-new-ios-18-2-beta-2/">includes a number of changes</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/10/Generic-iOS-18.2-Feature-Real-Mock.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-972123" /><br/>
A new Find My feature lets you <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/04/ios-18-2-beta-2-siri-chatgpt-limit/">temporarily share the location of an item like an AirTag</a> with an "airline or trusted person" which can be useful when trying to track down lost luggage or other items. <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/04/ios-18-2-beta-2-siri-chatgpt-limit/">Siri integration with ChatGPT has been enhanced</a> with information on daily limits for free users, as well as offering the ability to upgrade to a paid ChatGPT Plus plan. There are a number of other tweaks in the latest beta, so <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/04/everything-new-ios-18-2-beta-2/">check out the full article for more</a>!<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Apple Acquires Photo Editing App Maker Pixelmator</h2><br/>
In a surprise announcement, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/01/apple-acquires-pixelmator/">Pixelmator shared that it is being acquired by Apple</a>, bringing its popular Pixelmator and Photomator apps under Apple's purview.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/11/pixelmator.jpg" alt="" width="1500" height="720" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-974837" /><br/>
While there will be no immediate changes to the existing apps, the move could eventually see Pixelmator become an advanced image editing app for Apple, which previously offered Aperture in that role but ceased development on it a decade ago and it eventually stopped working on machines running macOS Catalina and later.<br/>
<br/>

<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/11/Gift-Guide-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-976398" /><br/>
These are some of our favorite products, many of which we use personally or have gifted to our friends and family members in the past. We'll be adding to the list throughout November, so check back in for more ideas.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="aura_frames"><a href="https://auraframes.com">Aura Frames</a></h2><br/>
Priced starting at &#36;149, <a href="https://auraframes.com">Aura digital frames</a> make a good gift for anyone who has digital photos, which is most of us these days. You can load photos on the frame using the Aura <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> app, and since images are stored in the cloud, there's no limit.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/11/aura-frames.jpg" alt="" width="1111" height="625" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-976379" /><br/>
Multiple people can upload images to a single frame, so it's a great way to share photos with friends and family members. If you know someone that's not technically savvy, like a grandparent, it's still the perfect gift because you can load photos for them remotely. The &#36;149 10.1-inch Carver is Aura's most affordable option, but there are sizes up to 15 inches, like the &#36;299 Walden. Aura also makes higher resolution options, including the &#36;199 Mason, and all the frames come in multiple colors to match any decor.<br/>
<br/>

Everyone I've gifted an Aura frame to has loved it, and it's my go-to for people that are hard to shop for.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="nanoleaf_light_panels_and_display_boxes"><a href="https://nanoleaf.me/en-US/products/nanoleaf-blocks/?category=blocks&amp;pack=smarter-kit&amp;squares=comboxl">Nanoleaf Light Panels</a> and <a href="https://nanoleaf.me/en-US/products/nanoleaf-expo-display-case/">Display Boxes</a></h2><br/>
Nanoleaf recently came out with some of its most useful light panels to date, <a href="https://nanoleaf.me/en-US/products/nanoleaf-blocks/?category=blocks&amp;pack=smarter-kit&amp;squares=comboxl">the Blocks</a>. Priced starting at &#36;225 for the combo kit, the Blocks come with different options like a pegboard you can hang things on, a shelf for knick knacks, and a texture panel that adds visual interest. There are smaller and larger squares, and all of the pieces are interchangeable for creating a unique setup.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/nanoleaf-blocks-2.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-963783" /><br/>
Like all Nanoleaf products, the Blocks can be controlled with the Nanoleaf app or with <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/homekit/">HomeKit</a>, and can be set to multi-colored patterns in a range of shades. These lights are bright enough to serve as a replacement for a standard light, which makes them extra versatile. Any gamer would appreciate these panels for a gaming setup, but they also work around TVs, in offices, and more.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/nanoleaf-blocks.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1500" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-963782" /><br/>
If you know someone that has collectibles, Nanoleaf also has the &#36;250 <a href="https://nanoleaf.me/en-US/products/nanoleaf-expo-display-case/?pack=smarter-kit&amp;size=4">EXPO Smart LED Display Case</a>. This is the perfect gift for someone that collects high-end sneakers, anime figures, or anything in that vein. It can be set to 16 million colors or shades of white, and colors can change in time with music.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/08/nanoleaf-display-case-1.jpg" alt="" width="1456" height="816" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-961155" /><br/>
For those that already have a Nanoleaf setup, the &#36;27 <a href="https://nanoleaf.me/en-US/products/essentials/sense-plus/?category=wireless-switch">Sense+ Smart Wireless Switch</a> is a sensible and inexpensive add-on that's super useful. It provides a physical control option for &zwnj;HomeKit&zwnj; lights, and there are built-in motion and daylight sensors for automating scenes. The Sense+ can be used for turning lights on or off, dimming lights, and swapping scenes.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/nanoleaf-smart-switch.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-963785" /><br/>
<h2 id="sonos_ace_headphones"><a href="https://howl.link/upr27rk8sm47p">Sonos Ace Headphones</a></h2><br/>
Apple's recent <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-max/">AirPods Max</a> "refresh" was disappointing and only added a USB-C port, and there are several other noise cancelling headphones on the market that are a better investment in 2024, like the <a href="https://howl.link/upr27rk8sm47p">Sonos Ace</a>. Priced at &#36;449, the Sonos Ace are cheaper than the &zwnj;AirPods Max&zwnj; and offer a more comfortable fit thanks to a lighter weight. There isn't as much pressure on the head with the Sonos Ace, and the ear cups are a comfortable memory foam that can fit a wide range of ear shapes and sizes.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/sonos-ace-headphones.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-951709" /><br/>
When we <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/21/hands-on-sonos-ace-headphones/">tested out the Sonos Ace</a> earlier this year, and we were impressed with the sound quality. Sonos added support for Dolby Atmos and spatial audio, and there's a TrueCinema feature that maps the space around you for the best surround sound. ANC blocks out irritating noise around you as well as the &zwnj;AirPods Max&zwnj; do, but if you need to hear sounds from the surroundings, there's an Aware Mode.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/sonos-ace-purple.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-964245" /><br/>
You can also pair the Sonos Ace with the Arc and the Arc Ultra Soundbars, which makes them a solid gift for someone in the Sonos ecosystem or someone looking for comfortable, premium over-ear headphones.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="airpods"><a href="https://www.apple.com/airpods-pro/?campaign=true">AirPods</a></h2><br/>
You'll never go wrong with AirPods as a gift, and this year there are three solid options to choose from. For the best noise cancelling, Apple sells the <a href="https://www.apple.com/airpods-pro/?campaign=true">&#36;249 AirPods Pro 2</a>, but you can probably find a pre-holiday sale to get them even cheaper.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/airpods-pro-2-gradient.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-967392" /><br/>
The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/">AirPods Pro</a> 2 have silicone tips that fit snugly in the ears to drown out sound, and with hearing aid support, these are the best bet if you have a family member that has mild hearing loss but doesn't wear hearing aids.<br/>
<br/>
People with hearing loss that have tested this out have been impressed with how well the hearing aid capability works, and &zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj; are much, much cheaper than traditional hearing aids. Hearing aid capabilities aren't yet available everywhere, including Canada and Australia, but support is available in Europe, the U.S., and 90+ other countries and regions.<br/>
<br/>
If you're purchasing for someone who doesn't like silicone ear tips, <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-airpods/airpods-4">the AirPods 4 are an option</a>. You can get them with or without Active Noise Cancellation. The ANC version doesn't cut out quite as much noise as the &zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj; 2, but it's enough to make a difference.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/10/airpods-4-blue.jpeg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-972562" /><br/>
With ANC, <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-airpods/airpods-4">the AirPods 4</a> cost &#36;179, and without ANC, they're &#36;129, which is the cheapest price Apple offers for AirPods. You might see some minor sales around Black Friday, but deep discounts are unlikely because the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods/">AirPods 4</a> are newer.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="aqara_u300_smart_lock"><a href="https://www.aqara.com/us/product/smart-lock-u300/">Aqara U300 Smart Lock</a></h2><br/>
It's probably a little weird to gift someone a Smart Lock for the holidays, but it's a genuinely useful home product that a lot of people probably don't have already.<br/>
<br/>
I've tested a few different smart locks, and I'm a fan of Aqara's options. <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FAqara-Fingerprint-Keyless-Touchscreen-Supports%2Fdp%2FB0D496H9YV">The &#36;200 U300</a> is the newest model, and it's for doors that only have a handle and not a deadbolt, like a door into a garage.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/10/aqara-u300-1.jpg" alt="" width="2048" height="1151" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-969181" /><br/>
The <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FAqara-U200-Fingerprint-Rechargeable-SmartThings%2Fdp%2FB0D1C75J4F">&#36;270 U200</a> is designed for doors that have a deadbolt, so your standard front or back door, plus there's the more affordable <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FAqara-Fingerprint-Bluetooth-Electronic-Weatherproof%2Fdp%2FB0CLNN2FDG">&#36;190 U100 version</a>. I like Aqara locks because there are so many ways to unlock them. They have support for Home Keys so you can use NFC with your &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; or Apple Watch Wallet app, but there are also passcodes you can enter with the keypad, NFC cards, and even a fingerprint sensor that works surprisingly well. You can let in guests, have the door autolock after it's closed, and set alarms.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/07/aqarau100.jpg" alt="" width="2235" height="1257" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-904570" /><br/>
Aqara does recommend a hub with its locks so you can control them away from home, but it's not entirely necessary. I also like a hub, because it ensures my locks are always connected to Wi-Fi and I don't run into connectivity issues. Aqara has some other useful sensors like <a href="https://www.aqara.com/en/product/presence-sensor-fp1e/">its Presence Sensor</a> for motion detection and activating &zwnj;HomeKit&zwnj; scenes, but I haven't tried them out. They're worth looking at if you're considering an Aqara lock and hub, since they also connect to the hub.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="philips_hue_lights"><a href="https://www.philips-hue.com/en-us">Philips Hue Lights</a></h2><br/>
I think I've tried every &zwnj;HomeKit&zwnj; smart bulb and light available at this point, and <a href="https://www.philips-hue.com/en-us">Philips Hue lights</a> are unquestionably the best you can get. I have no patience for lights that constantly disconnect or have connectivity issues, and the Hue bulbs don't. Yes, <a href="https://www.philips-hue.com/en-us/p/hue-bridge/046677458478">there is a &#36;60 Bridge</a>, but it's worth it, and not all lights require it.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/philips-hue-sync-box-8k.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-963771" /><br/>
The <a href="https://www.philips-hue.com/en-us/p/hue-white-and-color-ambiance-starter-kit-4-e26-smart-bulbs-75-w/046677563295">&#36;200 White and Color Starter Kit</a> comes with four Hue bulbs that can go in any lamp that supports E26 bulbs, and it comes with the hub. It's one of the best bets if you're buying a gift for someone who is new to smart home products. The bulbs can be controlled with the Home app or the Hue app, and they can be set to 16 million colors. Hue has great light effects and scenes that really shine when you have multiple bulbs.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/hue-pendant.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-932254" /><br/>
For a cheaper option, there's <a href="https://www.philips-hue.com/en-us/p/hue-white-starter-kit-2-e26-smart-bulbs-75-w/046677563080">the &#36;70 Starter Kit</a> that comes with a hub and two E26 white bulbs. There's no color with these, but they can be set to different shades of white.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/hue-go-lamp-orange-grip.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-932259" /><br/>
For computer or media setups, the <a href="https://www.philips-hue.com/en-us/products/smart-light-strips?filters=FK_HUE_GRADIENT&amp;page=1">Gradient Light Strips</a> priced starting at &#36;70 are excellent. Some other options:<br/>
<ul><br/>
 <li><a href="https://www.philips-hue.com/en-us/products/smart-light-bulbs?filters=FK_HUE_LIGHTING_BULB_TYPE_LIGHTGUIDE&amp;page=1">Lightguide bulbs</a> - These would be perfect paired with a simple lamp base, because the bulb is meant to be the star. I have two of the ellipse bulbs, and they're enormous and look great.</li><br/>
 <li><a href="https://www.philips-hue.com/en-us/products/string-lights">String lights</a> - For holiday fans or those with patio setups crying out for lighting, the Hue Festavia String Lights would make a good gift.</li><br/>
 <li><a href="https://www.philips-hue.com/en-us/p/hue-white-and-color-ambiance-signe-gradient-floor-lamp/046677803513">Signe floor lamp</a> - The Signe floor lamp isn't the most practical light because it doesn't have a wide radius and is meant to face the wall, but it makes for great accent lighting.</li><br/>
 <li><a href="https://www.philips-hue.com/en-us/p/hue-white-and-color-ambiance-go-portable-accent-light/7602031U7">Hue Go</a> - The Hue Go is a portable lamp that you can use plugged in or with the built-in battery, and it supports all of the same features as Hue bulbs. It's a nice accent light and good to have around for power outages.</li><br/>
 <li><a href="https://www.philips-hue.com/en-us/p/hue-white-and-color-ambiance-hue-go-portable-table-lamp/046677576455">Hue Go Portable Table Lamp</a> - This is a lot like the Hue Go, but it's a more traditional looking lamp. It's water resistant, so it can go outdoors, too.</li><br/>
</ul><br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="mokuyobi_bags_and_backpacks"><a href="https://mokuyobi.com/collections/backpack">Mokuyobi Bags and Backpacks</a></h2><br/>
For something beyond the boring black and brown computer bags you see everywhere, Mokuyobi has a range of multicolored bags in multiple styles. Most of them come with padded laptop compartments that are ideal for Macs and iPads, along with tons of other pockets.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/11/mokuyobi-laptop-bag-1.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-976382" /><br/>
I have several Mokuyobi bags that I have used for years and they still look brand new, and I get compliments on them all the time. This is a solid option if you're shopping for someone who likes color. I especially like the <a href="https://mokuyobi.com/collections/backpack/products/largo-traveler-mega-backpack">mega backpack</a> because it holds a laptop and an absolute ton of other stuff, so it makes a useful carry-on for flights.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/11/mokuyobi-laptop-bag-2.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-976383" /><br/>
There are smaller backpacks too, from the <a href="https://mokuyobi.com/collections/backpack/products/kelly-green-atlas-backpack">classic looking Atlas</a> to the <a href="https://mokuyobi.com/collections/backpack/products/schoolhouse-flyer-backpack">pocket laden Flyer backpack</a>. You can also get <a href="https://mokuyobi.com/collections/laptop-bag">colorful laptop cases</a> that fit everything up to a 16-inch <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro/">MacBook Pro</a>. The bags from Mokuyobi aren't cheap, but they come with a lifetime warranty.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="bambu_lab_3d_printer"><a href="https://bambulab.com/en-us">Bambu Lab 3D Printer</a></h2><br/>
Bambu Lab makes a range of 3D printers that you can print to using just an app on your &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; or your Mac. The <a href="https://us.store.bambulab.com/products/a1-mini?skr=yes">A1 Mini is just &#36;200</a>, or &#36;349 with the <a href="https://us.store.bambulab.com/products/a1-mini?variant=41513493627016&amp;skr=yes">AMS Lite</a> that lets you print with up to four filament colors. Bambu's printers are sort of the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; of 3D printers in that they're relatively easy to operate and have a lot of bells and whistles to streamline printing and cut down on issues. Models <a href="https://us.store.bambulab.com/products/x1-carbon">like the X1C</a> come with an enclosure.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/11/bambu-3d-printer-a1-mini.jpg" alt="" width="1800" height="1203" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-976384" /><br/>
I've had the &#36;999 X1C for over a year now and do not hesitate to recommend it for those interested in getting into 3D printing. It's easy to use, there are thousands of STLs out there for making everything you can think of, and you can even make your own using software like Tinkercad or Fusion 360.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/11/bambu-3d-printer-x1c.jpg" alt="" width="1800" height="1012" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-976385" /><br/>
I haven't personally used the A1 Mini, but it's a much more affordable way to try 3D printing, and it could make a great gift for an older teen or a partner who likes to tinker.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="ugreen_uno_chargers"><a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fstores%2FUGREEN%2FUGREENUnoSeries_NexodeSeries%2Fpage%2F488CA5D7-F4E6-42B7-97AB-EA509E3BAAD7">Ugreen Uno Chargers</a></h2><br/>
Ugreen wasn't a company I was familiar with until this year, but <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fstores%2FUGREEN%2FUGREENUnoSeries_NexodeSeries%2Fpage%2F488CA5D7-F4E6-42B7-97AB-EA509E3BAAD7">the "Uno" line of products</a> caught my eye. Uno is a range of charging accessories that Ugreen cleverly outfitted with little digital faces, and I love them.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/ugreen-uno-series.jpg" alt="" width="1491" height="839" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-964026" /><br/>
I'm reviewing Ugreen's Uno products later this month, but I wanted to include them here because I think they make for a fun gift that's not too expensive and that stands out from other charging products on the market.<br/>
<br/>
There's a <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FUGREEN-Charger-Compact-Adapter-MacBook%2Fdp%2FB0D3XR6S47">&#36;47 100W charger</a> with four ports and a <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FUGREEN-Charger-Compact-Adapter-MacBook%2Fdp%2FB0CY56KRCX%3F">&#36;36 65W charger with three ports</a>, both of which have legs and digital panels with face emoji that change based on charging state. When a device is fast charging, for example, there's a face that looks like it has its mouth full, and when charging is finished, there's a little face with sunglasses.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/ugreen-uno-power-bank.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-964028" /><br/>
There are also two power banks that have the little emoji faces, <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FUGREEN-Portable-Certified-Magnetic-10000mAh%2Fdp%2FB0D7CFCRBN">one that's 10,000mAh with Qi2 for &#36;50</a>, and one that's <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FUGREEN-Magnetic-Portable-Charging-Foldable%2Fdp%2FB0D228PXC">5,000mAh with USB-C</a> and 7.5W Qi charging for &#36;33. They come with built-in stands that look like little headphones, which is a nice touch because you can use the stand for watching videos or FaceTiming.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/ugreen-uno-usb-c-charger.jpg" alt="" width="1246" height="701" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-964029" /><br/>
There's also a <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FUGREEN-Certified-Wireless-Foldable-Compatible%2Fdp%2FB0D4DX8PH3">&#36;49 desktop charger</a> that can charge an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; and AirPods, a <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FUGREEN-10Gbps-MacBook-Surface-Thinkpad%2Fdp%2FB0D2Q5XJY9">&#36;17 6-port USB-C hub</a>, and even a <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FUGREEN-Charging-Display-iPhone-MacBook%2Fdp%2FB0D7B719XQ%3Fref_%3Dast_sto_dp%26amp%3Bth%3D1">&#36;13 USB-C cable</a> with a little face. Of the bunch, I think the power banks will make the best gift, because who can't use another power bank?<br/>
<br/>
As an adult, I'm a fan of the little robot chargers, and I'm sure I'm not alone, but these are also fun for kids.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="bird_buddy"><a href="https://mybirdbuddy.com">Bird Buddy</a></h2><br/>
Available <a href="https://mybirdbuddy.com/shop/">starting at &#36;189</a>, the <a href="https://mybirdbuddy.com/">Bird Buddy</a> is the kind of gift that almost anyone will like, which makes it great for the person that has everything. It is a Wi-Fi connected smart bird feeder that sends you pictures of the birds that come to visit.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/bird-buddy-main-image.jpg" alt="" width="1630" height="917" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-959300" /><br/>
You'll need to fill it with seed regularly and charge it up when necessary, but other than that, it operates on its own. To do away with charging, I recommend the solar version, which starts at &#36;239.<br/>

There's a Bird Buddy Pro now that can capture 2K video in HDR and with slow motion for even better snapshots, or if you like hummingbirds, there's a model just for feeding them. I've gifted the Bird Buddy and it's been a huge hit, with adults and kids too. <br/>

		<description><![CDATA[With the launch of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a>, Apple added support for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/rcs/">RCS</a>, or Rich Communication Services. &zwnj;RCS&zwnj; replaces SMS/MMS as the default messaging standard for any "green bubble" conversations, and because it's more modern, it supports features like read receipts and typing indicators.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/apple-rcs-thumb.jpg" alt="" width="2776" height="1562" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-923042" /><br/>
&zwnj;RCS&zwnj; is also supposed to support emoji reactions from Android users, but it wasn't working properly when &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj; launched. It's not clear what changed, but <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/7/24290703/apple-green-bubble-message-reaction-rcs-android">The Verge</a></em> says that something that Google or Apple tweaked made it work as of this week.<br/>
<br/>
When an Android user uses an emoji reaction to a message that you've sent over &zwnj;RCS&zwnj;, the emoji will now show up in line with the message bubble, just like it does on with iOS Tapback reactions.<br/>
<br/>
Prior to now, if an Android user used an emoji reaction to a message in a conversation with an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> user, the emoji would show up on a separate line, which was confusing and not how the feature was meant to work.<br/>
<br/>
<em>The Verge</em> says it tested emoji reactions between iPhones running iOS 18.1 and several different Android phones, and reactions display both ways as intended.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/android/">Android</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/rcs/">RCS</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/08/green-bubble-emoji-reactions/">Green Bubble Emoji Reactions From Android Users Now Show Up Properly on iPhones</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/green-bubble-emoji-reactions-from-android-users-now-show-up-properly-on-iphones.2442395/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

There are parts and tools available for repairing or replacing an iPhone 16's display, battery, rear camera system, TrueDepth camera for Face ID, back glass, bottom and top speakers, main microphone, and more. Tool kits are available to rent for seven days for all four iPhone 16 models, with U.S. pricing set at &#36;49 for each kit.<br/>
<br/>
Apple already <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/20/iphone-16-repair-manual/">shared repair manuals for all four iPhone 16 models</a> in September, and now the necessary parts and tools are available to customers.<br/>
<br/>
Launched in 2022, Apple's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/self-service-repair/">self-service program</a> provides customers with access to genuine parts, tools, and manuals to repair select iPhones and Macs, as well as the Studio Display. The company has said the program is "intended for individuals who are experienced with the complexities of repairing electronic devices."

		<description><![CDATA[YouTube channel Brandon Geekabit today shared a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO-SeqntnSc">teardown video</a> for the new Mac mini base model with the M4 chip, 256GB of storage, and 16GB of RAM. The video provides the first complete look inside Apple's smallest Mac ever, revealing the computer's logic board, built-in power supply, cooling system, and other components.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IO-SeqntnSc?si=9kXURku34mU9KrC3" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><br/>
While previous Mac mini models with Apple silicon chips had plenty of unused internal space, since the computer had not been redesigned since it used Intel processors, components take up nearly all of the space inside the new model.<br/>
<br/>
The bottom metal plate on the Mac mini continues to double as an antenna. Once that is removed, you can see the fan and heat sink that help to keep the computer running cool. Beyond that, you can see the Mac mini's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/08/m4-mac-mini-modular-storage/">modular storage</a> that we reported on earlier today. The base model with 256GB of storage has two 128GB chips, which means it will <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/01/24/m2-mac-mini-256gb-slower-ssd/">no longer have slower SSD speeds</a> compared to higher-capacity models. Last, you can see the Mac mini's logic board with the M4 chip and the power supply below that.<br/>
<br/>
The new Mac mini has an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/29/m4-mac-mini-thermal-architecture/">innovative thermal architecture</a>, in which air is guided from the bottom foot to different levels of the computer.<br/>
<br/>

As far as the new Mac mini's repairability is concerned, we will have to wait for the website iFixit to share its own teardown video.<br/>
<br/>
Overall, the new Mac mini is an impressive engineering feat made possible by the industry-leading performance-per-watt characteristics of Apple silicon. The new Mac mini launched in stores today, and we recently shared <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/08/m4-mac-mini-hands-on/">our own hands-on video</a>.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-mini/">Mac mini</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/teardown/">Teardown</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Mac_Mini">Mac Mini (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/mac-mini.146">Mac mini</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/08/m4-mac-mini-teardown/">New Mac Mini Teardown Provides Look Inside Apple&#039;s Smallest Mac Ever</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/new-mac-mini-teardown-provides-look-inside-apples-smallest-mac-ever.2442383/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple launched the new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-mini/">Mac mini</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/">iMac</a>, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro/">MacBook Pro</a> models with M4 chips today, and because the &zwnj;Mac mini&zwnj; is the only one of the machines that got a design update, we thought we'd check it out to see how it compares to the prior version.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RKIXqNOOkKg" title="Apple&#39;s New M4 Pro Mac Mini Impressions &amp; Benchmarks!" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/macrumors?sub_confirmation=1">Subscribe to the MacRumors YouTube channel</a> for more videos.</em></div><br/>
The 2024 version of the &zwnj;Mac mini&zwnj; is much smaller than the previous <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m2/">M2</a> model, so it takes up less space on a desktop. It's 5 by 5 inches, down from 7.75 by 7.75 inches, and you can really see a difference when they're side-by-side. There were rumors that the &zwnj;Mac mini&zwnj; could be as small as the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a>, but it's not <em>that</em> small.<br/>
<br/>
It's impressive to have a powerful M4 computer in such a small enclosure, and with so many available ports. There are two ports on the front and three on the back, all USB-C or Thunderbolt. If you have USB-A accessories, you'll need an adapter. There's also an HDMI port, a 3.5mm headphone jack, an Ethernet port, and a port for the power cable.<br/>
<br/>
You can get the &zwnj;Mac mini&zwnj; with an M4 or an M4 Pro chip, and the M4 version has three Thunderbolt 4 ports at the back while the M4 Pro version has three Thunderbolt 5 ports that support faster transfer speeds. The M4 and the M4 Pro offer notable speed improvements over the prior &zwnj;M2&zwnj; and &zwnj;M2&zwnj; Pro chips. We've got the full array of benchmarks in the video, but CPU performance is up to 55 percent faster in the M4 Pro compared to the &zwnj;M2&zwnj; Pro. GPU performance is up significantly, and even the SSD is faster.<br/>
<br/>
Apple is also selling the M4 Macs with 16GB RAM at a minimum, which is a major upgrade over the previous 8GB starting RAM for the base model.<br/>
<br/>
The &zwnj;Mac mini&zwnj; is priced starting at &#36;599, but that's because it doesn't come with a display or peripherals. You'll need to supply your own. It's a solid machine for home or work, and because it's so small, you can take it from one place to another if you have two setups with displays and accessories.<br/>
<br/>
There is one downside to the &zwnj;Mac mini&zwnj;. If you often turn your Mac off and on, you might be annoyed to find that the power button is on the bottom of the device. To access it, you'll need to lift the &zwnj;Mac mini&zwnj; up a bit. That's no big deal if you don't turn your computer off regularly, but if you do, just note there's a little bit of an extra hassle to deal with.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[On this week's episode of <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/visionos-2-2-and-where-vision-pro-goes-next/id1602394741?i=1000676230685">The MacRumors Show</a>, we discuss visionOS 2.2 and Apple's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/03/apple-vision-pro-with-m5-chip-rumor/">potential move</a> into iPhone-connected glasses.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XgAGwIjepNc?si=q46d6WwlgUsrNrU7" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@themacrumorsshow?sub_confirmation=1">Subscribe to The MacRumors Show YouTube channel</a> for more videos</em></div><br/>
<br/>
visionOS 2.2 brings <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/04/visionos-2-2-beta-ultrawide-mac-virtual-display/">Wide and Ultrawide modes</a> to the Vision Pro's Mac Virtual Display feature. Mac Virtual Display allows Apple's Vision Pro headset to be used as an external display for a Mac. The feature has been available since visionOS was first released earlier this year, but the wider options are new in the latest beta. Apple has previously said the ultrawide version of Mac Virtual Display is equivalent to having two physical 4K displays sitting side by side on a desk.<br/>
<br/>
<ul><li><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/05/vision-pro-ultrawide-display/">Testing the Vision Pro With New Ultrawide Display Option in visionOS 2.2</a></li><br/>
</ul><br/>
<br/>
We discuss the experience of using the new Mac Virtual Display modes and whether it makes the Vision Pro more useful. visionOS 2.2 will likely be released to the public in December alongside iOS 18.2, iPadOS 18.2, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sequoia/">macOS Sequoia</a> 15.2, watchOS 11.2, tvOS 18.2, and other updates.<br/>
<br/>
We also talk through where Apple's Vision product line is headed next. There are now a multitude of rumors from reliable sources about a new, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/27/kuo-apple-vision-pro-m5-chip-apple-intelligence/">M5-powered Vision Pro headset</a> with <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/">Apple Intelligence</a> that is apparently set to launch next year.<br/>
<br/>
Apple is also said to be <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/03/apple-vision-pro-with-m5-chip-rumor/">"seriously considering" a new Vision device</a> that offloads computing to a paired <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> and serves as an accessory for watching movies, similar to Xreal.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[The new 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models with M4, M4 Pro, and M4 Max chips <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/08/new-macs-now-available-for-apple-store-pickup/">launched in stores today</a>. If you are not planning to upgrade this year, be aware that there are already rumors about next year's MacBook Pro models with M5 series chips.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/10/Apple-MacBook-Pro-M4-hero.jpg" alt="" width="3840" height="2160" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-974025" /><br/>
It appears the MacBook Pro will remain on an annual upgrade cycle next year. Apple supply chain analyst Ming-Chi Kuo today <a href="https://medium.com/@mingchikuo/sunny-optical-to-benefit-significantly-from-apples-optical-order-growth-and-spec-upgrades-over-220ec84343ad">said</a> camera module shipments for MacBook Pro models with M5 series chips will begin in 2025, and <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman also recently said MacBook Pro models with M5, M5 Pro, and M5 Max chips <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/03/future-macbook-pro-rumors/">will launch next year</a>. In fact, he said Apple's development of those chips was already near completion.<br/>
<br/>
MacBook Pro announcement dates:<br/>
<br/>
<ul><li><strong>M4, M4 Pro, and M4 Max models:</strong> October 30, 2024</li><br/>
<li><strong>M3, M3 Pro, and M3 Max models:</strong> October 30, 2023</li><br/>
<li><strong>M2 Pro and M2 Max models:</strong> January 17, 2023 (it has been rumored that this launch was initially planned for October 2022)</li><br/>
<li><strong>M1 Pro and M1 Max models:</strong> October 18, 2021</li></ul><br/>
<br/>
Gurman believes the MacBook Pro will not receive any major design changes next year, with bigger changes like an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/03/future-macbook-pro-rumors/">OLED display and a thinner design rumored for 2026</a>. The last major redesign to the MacBook Pro line occurred in 2021.<br/>
<br/>
All in all, expect the MacBook Pro to receive yet another modest spec bump with performance improvements and other internal upgrades next year, and start saving your money for the two-generations-away models with a "total redesign."<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today indicated that its extended return policy is now in effect for the 2024 holiday shopping season. The policy applies to most products that Apple sells, but there are a few exceptions, including carrier-financed iPhones.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/11/2024-iPhone-Boxes.jpg" alt="" width="1322" height="744" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-976305" /><br/>
In the U.S., Canada, U.K., Australia, and many other countries, most products purchased between November 8 and December 25 of this year may be returned through January 8, 2025, <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/help/returns_refund">according to Apple's website</a>. All purchases made after December 25 in those countries are subject to Apple's standard 14-day return policy.<br/>
<br/>
If you placed an order through Apple's online store, the extended return policy applies to eligible products that you <strong>receive</strong> between November 8 and December 25 too. That means anyone who pre-ordered a new Mac mini, iMac, or MacBook Pro has until January 8 to return those computers, if they choose to.<br/>
<br/>
In some countries, such as Italy, Spain, Japan, and Mexico, the return window is slightly longer. Apple says most products purchased in those countries between November 8 and January 6 may be returned through January 20.<br/>
<br/>
Apple has also updated its <a href="https://www.apple.com/store">online "Store" page</a> with gift recommendations for the holidays.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-store/">Apple Store</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/08/apples-extended-return-policy-2024/">Apple&#039;s Extended Return Policy Now in Effect for 2024 Holiday Season</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apples-extended-return-policy-now-in-effect-for-2024-holiday-season.2442332/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro/">MacBook Pro</a> is available in 14-inch and 16-inch sizes, with three distinct models starting at &#36;1,599, &#36;1,999, and &#36;2,499, so which should you choose?<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/10/Apple-MacBook-Pro-M4-lineup-1.jpg" alt="" width="3840" height="2743" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-974031" /><br/>
With a range of three similar models in the lineup to choose from, our guide helps to answer the question of how to decide which of these MacBook Pros is best for you. The three models are as follows:<br/>
<br/>
<ul><br/>
<li><strong>14-Inch MacBook Pro with M4</strong>: An entry-level model for users who need a machine that is more powerful and versatile than the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/">MacBook Air</a>.</li><br/>
<li><strong>14-Inch MacBook Pro with M4 Pro or M4 Max</strong>: A more powerful, high-end model with a choice of performance-focused chips. It comes with higher memory bandwidth, larger quantities of memory, support for additional external displays, and an 8TB storage option, but loses two hours of battery life.</li><br/>
<li><strong>16-Inch MacBook Pro with M4 Pro or M4 Max</strong>: A model with identical specifications to the 14-inch model with the M4 Pro or M4 Max chips, but with a significantly larger display and up to two extra hours of battery life. It also gains High Power Mode to boost performance.</li><br/>
</ul><br/>
<br/>
Each &zwnj;MacBook Pro&zwnj; is configurable to add more a more powerful processor and larger quantities of memory and storage. Read on for a detailed break down of all of the differences between the three &zwnj;MacBook Pro&zwnj; models.<br/>

<div class="clear"></div><br/>
<br/>
<h3 id="display_size">Display Size</h3><br/>
The &zwnj;MacBook Pro&zwnj; is offered in 14.2-inch and 16.2-inch display sizes. The 16.2-inch display is a better replacement for a desktop machine and provides much more screen space to arrange multiple windows and use professional applications that benefit from the additional display area. The 14.2-inch display is still larger than the 13.6-inch &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj;, and will likely be the best overall balance of needs for most users.<br/>
<br/>
<h3 id="design">Design</h3><br/>
The 16-inch model is, of course, physically larger than the 14-inch model, with a markedly bigger overall footprint. It is also worth noting that the 16-inch model is also 0.13 cm thicker and up to 1.4 pounds (0.64 kg) heavier. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2013/09/macbook-pro-sizes.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1055" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-821775" /><br/>
The 14-inch &zwnj;MacBook Pro&zwnj; is decidedly more portable and comfortable than the 16-inch model to carry around on a daily basis. Though the 16-inch &zwnj;MacBook Pro&zwnj; can still fit in larger bags and is an acceptable size for travel, it is a much bigger, heavier machine. If you are considering the 16-inch &zwnj;MacBook Pro&zwnj;, you should make sure you are comfortable with its size and weight—especially if you plan to use it on the go.<br/>
<br/>
<h3 id="chip_configurations">Chip Configurations</h3><br/>
Both the 14-inch and 16-inch models are equally upgradeable to the M4 Max chip with a 16-core CPU and 40-core GPU, but if you are looking to spend as little as possible or do not need a high level of performance for intense workflows the 14-inch &zwnj;MacBook Pro&zwnj; is also available with the standard M4 chip. The M4 offers a more balanced processor with more of a focus on efficiency to prolong battery life, which will be more appropriate for users with less demanding requirements. Buyers should be aware that the M4 chip is limited to 120GB/s memory bandwidth, 32GB of memory, 2TB storage, and supports just two external displays.<br/>
<br/>
The base configuration of the 14-inch &zwnj;MacBook Pro&zwnj; features an M4 Pro with 12-core CPU and 16-core GPU, while the base 16-inch model contains an M4 Pro with 14-core CPU and 20-core GPU. If you upgrade the 14-inch model to the same M4 Pro with 14-core CPU and 20-core GPU that the 16-inch model starts with, it increases to &#36;2,299 – just &#36;300 less than the starting price of the 16-inch model.<br/>
<br/>
For those who are leaning toward buying the 16-inch &zwnj;MacBook Pro&zwnj; and want the 14-core CPU and 20-core GPU at a minimum, the slimmer price difference between the two models to just &#36;300 may make it easier to justify getting the larger machine. On the other hand, if you do not need the performance of the M4 Pro with 14-core CPU and 20-core GPU, the 16-inch model may be overkill, and getting the 14-inch model will be the best way to keep costs down.<br/>
<br/>
<h3 id="high_power_mode">High Power Mode</h3><br/>
The M4 Pro and M4 Max chips offer a software feature called High Power Mode. When enabled, High Power Mode boosts the machine's performance to better meet the needs of intensive, sustained workloads.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/High-Power-Mode-Feature-2.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-921421" /><br/>
High Power Mode is designed to optimize and improve performance for resource-intensive tasks, such as color grading 8K ProRes video, according to Apple. When enabled, High Power Mode will de-prioritize resource-hungry system processes in order to leverage the full performance capability of the ‌M4 Max chip. The setting is effectively the opposite of "Low Power Mode," which aims to decrease system performance in favor of prolonging battery life.<br/>
<br/>
<ul><li><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/high-power-mode-macbook-pro/">How to Use High Power Mode on MacBook Pro</a></li></ul><br/>
<br/>
The M4 and M4 Pro chips do not feature High Power Mode, so if you want the ability to selectively push your processor to its limits, you will need to buy a machine with the M4 Max chip.<br/>
<br/>
<h3 id="battery_life">Battery Life</h3><br/>
Owing to its larger size, the 16-inch &zwnj;MacBook Pro&zwnj; contains a larger battery and has longer-lasting battery life. The 14-inch model contains a 72.4-watt-hour battery, while the 16-inch model contains a 100-watt-hour battery.<br/>
<br/>
Apple says the M4 14-inch &zwnj;MacBook Pro&zwnj; can deliver up to 24 hours of battery life when playing back video, but this drops to 18- or 22-hours when configured with the M4 Pro or M4 Max. The 16-inch model features 22-hours of battery life with the M4 Max and 24-hours with the M4 Pro when playing back video. For users who need maximum battery life, the M4 14-inch model or the M4 Pro 16-inch model will be the best options. That being said, the battery life of the other configurations is still good enough for most users.<br/>
<br/>
<h3 id="charging_and_connectivity">Charging and Connectivity</h3><br/>
The 14-inch &zwnj;MacBook Pro&zwnj; uses a 70W or 96W USB-C power adapter for charging, while the 16-inch model comes with a 140W power adapter. Both models support fast charging, but a 96W or higher USB-C power adapter is required. The 96W USB-C power adapter is a &#36;20 option on the base model 14-inch &zwnj;MacBook Pro&zwnj;, but it comes as standard with M4 Pro configurations with a 14-core CPU and ones with the M4 Max.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/10/macbook-pro-magsafe-3-charging.jpg" alt="" width="1960" height="1274" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-821241" /><br/>
Both models can use the &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; 3 or USB-C ports to fast charge. They can charge with up to 100W via their USB-C ports, but since the 16-inch model has a larger battery, it is not classified as "fast charging" on this machine.<br/>
<br/>
The &zwnj;MacBook Pro&zwnj; with the M4 Pro and M4 Max chips features Thunderbolt 5 ports, but the model with the standard M4 chip is limited to Thunderbolt 4. Thunderbolt 4 wired transfers should be more than sufficient for most users, but it is still a difference worth noting.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="final_thoughts">Final Thoughts</h2><br/>
The 16-inch &zwnj;MacBook Pro&zwnj; is &#36;500 more than the 14-inch model with the base M4 Pro chip, so you should be sure that you need the additional display area, battery life, and perhaps even High Power Mode support to justify its higher price. That being said, if you upgrade the 14-inch model to the same M4 Pro with 14-core CPU and 20-core GPU that the 16-inch model starts with, the price difference shrinks to &#36;300, and it may be worth opting for the larger model—especially if you could take advantage of its longer battery life.<br/>
<br/>
Buyers of the 16-inch model should be aware that it is considerably larger, thicker, and heavier than the 14-inch model, to the extent that it could be needlessly cumbersome to some users. The 14-inch &zwnj;MacBook Pro&zwnj; is clearly a more portable machine, so if you intend to carry your &zwnj;MacBook Pro&zwnj; around frequently or need the versatility of it easily fitting into a bag for transport, the smaller model is the better option by far.<br/>
<br/>
If you need more than 16GB of memory and are interested in the 14-inch model with the M4 chip, a 24GB memory configuration pushes the price up to &#36;1,799. The 14-inch &zwnj;MacBook Pro&zwnj; with the M4 Pro chip has 24GB of memory as standard and starts at &#36;1,999. In this case, it may be worth spending the extra &#36;200 to gain two extra CPU cores and six extra GPU cores, unless you are particularly concerned about losing two hours of battery life.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro/">MacBook Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Pro_16">MacBook Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macbook-pro.90">MacBook Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/14-inch-vs-16-inch-macbook-pro/">14-Inch vs. 16-Inch MacBook Pro Buyer&#039;s Guide 2024</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/14-inch-vs-16-inch-macbook-pro-buyers-guide-2024.2317972/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple has returned to using two 128GB storage chips in the new Mac mini with 256GB of storage, according to a <a href="https://x.com/ohgkg/status/1854859167213011199">partial teardown video</a> shared on social media today. This means the base-model Mac mini with the M4 chip will not have significantly slower SSD speeds compared to higher-end configurations of the computer with 512GB, 1TB, or 2TB of storage, as multiple NAND chips allows for faster SSD read and write speeds.<br/>

The teardown video also reveals that storage is modular in the new Mac mini, meaning that it can be easily removed since it is not soldered down. As we saw with the Mac Studio, however, replacing the modular storage <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/03/explaining-the-mac-studios-removable-ssds-and-why-you-cant-just-swap-them-out/">is complicated</a>.<br/>
<br/>
The previous-generation Mac mini base model with the M2 chip has a single 256GB storage chip, resulting in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/01/24/m2-mac-mini-256gb-slower-ssd/">30% to 50% slower SSD read and write speeds</a> compared to higher-capacity models. The slower speeds led to criticism from some customers.<br/>

A single 256GB storage chip also led to slower SSD speeds <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/06/13/15-inch-macbook-air-single-256gb-chip/">in the MacBook Air</a> and 13-inch MacBook Pro base models with the M2 chip a few years ago. Apple returned to using two 128GB storage chips in 256GB configurations of MacBook Air models with the M3 chip <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/09/base-model-m3-macbook-air-faster-ssd/">earlier this year</a>, while the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/30/apple-discontinues-13-inch-macbook-pro/">13-inch MacBook Pro line was discontinued last year</a> and replaced with an entry-level 14-inch MacBook Pro that starts with 512GB of storage.<br/>
<br/>
The criticism surrounding Apple's decision to use a single 256GB chip in some base-model Macs a few years ago primarily came from a vocal contingent of tech enthusiasts, and the average customer is unlikely to even notice the slower speeds in common day-to-day tasks. Nevertheless, it appears that customers who do want the fastest SSD speeds do not need to worry about which storage capacity they choose when ordering the new Mac mini.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-mini/">Mac mini</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/teardown/">Teardown</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Mac_Mini">Mac Mini (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/mac-mini.146">Mac mini</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/08/m4-mac-mini-modular-storage/">New Mac Mini Has Modular Storage, 256GB Model Will Have Faster SSD</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/new-mac-mini-has-modular-storage-256gb-model-will-have-faster-ssd.2442321/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> 18 Pro models will feature an upgraded main rear camera with a variable aperture for the first time, according to Apple analyst <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/">Ming-Chi Kuo</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/10/iPhone-17-Pro-Max-Smaller-Notch-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-972616" /><br/>
Apple has gradually expanded new camera technologies, such as sensor-shift stabilization, 48-megapixel sensors, and the tetraprism 5x telephoto camera, across its &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; models in recent years. It now appears that after completing the rear camera array's transition to 48-megapixel sensors by bringing one to the telephoto camera on next year's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17/">iPhone 17</a> Pro models, the next significant camera upgrade will be the introduction of a variable aperture.<br/>
<br/>
The information comes from Kuo's latest <a href="https://medium.com/@mingchikuo/舜宇光學可望顯著受益於未來兩年apple光學訂單成長與規格升級-216067d2c06f">post on Medium</a>, where he outlined how upcoming products such as the &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj; "Slim," M5 <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro/">MacBook Pro</a>, and &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 18 will affect Apple supplier Sunny Optical. Kuo believes that Sunny Optical and Luxshare will be the primary and secondary shutter suppliers for the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 18 Pro's new main camera, while the variable aperture lens will be supplied by Sunny Optical and Largan Precision.<br/>
<br/>
The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-14/">iPhone 14</a> Pro, 15 Pro, and 16 Pro's main cameras feature a fixed aperture of ƒ/1.78. A variable aperture on future &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; models would allow the main camera to control the amount of light entering the lens, allowing it to adjust to different lighting conditions. It also would provide more control over depth of field, enabling sharper focus on subjects or smoother background blur. The &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 18 is expected to launch in 2026.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/largan/">Largan</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/luxshare/">Luxshare</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/">Ming-Chi Kuo</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/08/variable-aperture-rumored-for-iphone-18-pro/">Variable Aperture Rumored to Bring Major Camera Upgrade to iPhone 18 Pro</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/variable-aperture-rumored-to-bring-major-camera-upgrade-to-iphone-18-pro.2442310/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<title>Apple Drops Promised &#039;Sketch&#039; Style Option From Image Playground</title>

		<description><![CDATA[When <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/image-playground/">Image Playground</a> was first introduced in June as one of the key <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/">Apple Intelligence</a> features, Apple said that it would generate images in three styles: animation, illustration, and sketch.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/10/image-playground-ios-18-2.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-972926" /><br/>
The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/04/apple-releases-ios-18-2-beta-2/">version of Image Playground</a> available in the iOS 18.2, iPadOS 18.2, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sequoia/">macOS Sequoia</a> 15.2 betas only offers animation and illustration as style options, leaving us wondering if sketch might be added a later time.<br/>
<br/>
It looks like the answer might be no, as Apple has removed Sketch from the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/image-playground/id6479176117">Image Playground app description</a>. &zwnj;Image Playground&zwnj; used to list three styles as design options, but it was updated to two, and the line about Sketch was removed. Here's what was removed:<blockquote>The highly detailed and academic Sketch style produces gorgeous drawings on stark backgrounds.</blockquote>The updated app description only mentions animation and Illustration.<blockquote>Animation style offers a whimsical, 3D cartoon look with expressive characters and cinematic environments. Illustration style is defined by strong outlines, simple shapes, and bold colors, providing uplifting and playful compositions.</blockquote>While Apple updated the Style portion of the &zwnj;Image Playground&zwnj; app description, one mistaken mention of three style options remains at the top. "&zwnj;Image Playground&zwnj;, powered by &zwnj;Apple Intelligence&zwnj;, lets you turn descriptions, concepts or people from your photo library into original, fun images in three unique styles."<br/>
<br/>
Sketch is also still listed as an option <a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-intelligence/">on Apple's website</a> highlighting &zwnj;Apple Intelligence&zwnj; features, but Apple will likely remove these remaining references soon.<br/>
<br/>
It isn't clear why Apple decided to eliminate the sketch option from &zwnj;Image Playground&zwnj;, or if sketch or other styles will be added in the future. As it stands, &zwnj;Image Playground&zwnj; in iOS 18.2, iPadOS 18.2, and &zwnj;macOS Sequoia&zwnj; 15.2 will only include animation and illustration as style options. The updates are set to launch in early December.<br/>
