		<description><![CDATA[The current <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/">iPad Air</a> was introduced in March last year, adding the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m1/">M1</a> chip, Center Stage on the front-facing camera, a faster USB-C port, and several new color options, but it was still a fairly minor upgrade over the previous model from September 2020. As we near a year and a half since the fifth-generation &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; was introduced, what can users expect from the sixth-generation model and when will it launch?<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/03/Air-2022-M1-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2244" height="1272" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-839997" /><br/>
As of 2023, it has been some time since the &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; had a major hardware refresh. Yet due to its positioning between the entry-level <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> and the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a>, it is not immediately clear what a new &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; model could gain without cannibalizing the &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
There have been few concrete rumors about the features the next &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; will offer as yet, so the overall picture of what to expect is still somewhat fluid. <em>Bloomberg</em>'s <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a> has repeatedly said that an &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/01/08/airpods-apple-watch-ipad-apple-tv-2023/">update this year with a minor "spec bump"</a> is not out of the question, suggesting that the upgrade will be fairly iterative, targeting several small but significant areas.<br/>
<br/>
A chip upgrade is the most certain feature coming to the next &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj;. The &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; currently contains the &zwnj;M1&zwnj; chip. There have been no reports about what chip the next-generation &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; will feature, but the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m2/">M2</a> chip has now been in the &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; for almost a year, meaning that it should be more than suitable for the &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj;. For comparison, the &zwnj;M1&zwnj; chip was present in the previous-generation &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; for 11 months before it came to to the &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj;. There is even the possibility that it could skip the &zwnj;M2&zwnj; and get the M3 chip instead, depending on the timing of its release.<br/>
<br/>
A minor spec bump is also likely to include upgrades to the front and rear cameras, potentially bringing features like Photonic Engine to the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; for the first time. ProRes video recording, Audio zoom, stereo audio recording, Portrait mode, and Portrait Lighting support are all plausible upgrades in this area.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/03/ipad-air-m1-2.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-840368" /><br/>
A horizontally oriented front-facing camera and a Thunderbolt port are among the other potential features for the sixth-generation &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj;. The latest &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; models brought connectivity upgrades like Wi-Fi 6E and Bluetooth 5.3 to the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; for the first time. By now, these capabilities are overdue to make their way to the &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj;. Similarly, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-pencil/">Apple Pencil</a> hover, another &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; Pro-exclusive feature, could finally trickle down to the &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; in its next incarnation.<br/>
<br/>
A new &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; launching this year is certainly more likely than a new &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; emerging, but Apple historically has only updated the device around every two years. While a refresh to add the &zwnj;M2&zwnj; chip is certainly possible in 2023, it may be more probable that Apple will again wait two years to update the device and target 2024 for a more worthwhile upgrade.<br/>
<br/>
Last month, Apple analyst <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/">Ming-Chi Kuo</a> said that new &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; models are <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/12/kuo-new-ipads-unlikely-to-launch-this-year/">"unlikely" to launch this year</a>, seemingly leaning into a 2024 launch for the next-generation &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj;. However, a reliable Weibo leaker recently said that the sixth-generation &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/10/ipad-air-6-rumored-to-launch-in-october/">should launch in October</a> as the only &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; refresh of 2023, with "no mini and Pro this year."<br/>
<br/>
More strikingly, on a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/08/the-macrumors-show-mark-gurman-iphone-15-event-expectations/">September episode</a> of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/the-macrumors-show/">The MacRumors Show</a> podcast, &zwnj;Mark Gurman&zwnj; said that there is a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/09/gurman-october-apple-event-unlikely/">new iPad Air</a> with improved specifications in the works and the device is apparently "coming soonish," likely this month. As such, the sixth-generation &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; appears to now be pending release, meaning that a launch in the near future cannot yet be ruled out. If a month passes with no such occurrence, the first half of 2024 will become the most likely scenario.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/05/ipad-air-6-new-features-and-launch-timing/">iPad Air 6: Potential New Features and Launch Timing</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ipad-air-6-potential-new-features-and-launch-timing.2406455/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[A bug impacting search functionality in the Messages app for some iPhone 15 users appears to be fixed in the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/03/apple-seeds-ios-17-1-beta-2-to-developers/">second beta of iOS 17.1</a> released this week.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/07/iOS-17-Messages-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2250" height="1266" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-903379" /><br/>
Some early adopters of iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Pro models have complained that the Messages app's search tool only displays recent messages after transferring content from another iPhone. The issue has been mentioned by several users across the <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/search-cant-find-old-messages-on-new-phone.2404157">MacRumors Forums</a> and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/iphone/comments/16orvq0/ios_17_search_function_for_imessage_only_showing/">Reddit</a> since the devices launched earlier this month.<br/>
<br/>
The bug is present on all iOS 17 versions up to the first iOS 17.1 beta, but many affected users said it <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/iOSBeta/comments/16yy2b6/ios_171_developer_beta_2_released/k3bd5fc/">has been fixed</a> as of the second iOS 17.1 beta. It may take up to a day for the device to index and restore the older messages. Some users said they needed to open the Settings app, tap on Messages, tap on Siri & Search, turn off all of the settings shown, restart the iPhone, and re-enable those settings in order for the issue to be fixed.<br/>
<br/>
iOS 17.1 is expected to be released in late October, so users not interested in installing the beta might have to wait a few more weeks for the fix.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-14/">iPhone 14</a> now sits in the middle of Apple's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> lineup below the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a>, but above the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone-se-vs-iphone-13/">iPhone SE and iPhone 13</a>. The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-13/">iPhone 13</a> starts at &#36;599, while the &zwnj;iPhone 14&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPhone 14&zwnj; Plus are priced at &#36;699 and &#36;799, so how different are the two successive &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; generations?<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/iPhone-13-vs-iPhone-14-Feature-2.5.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-915707" /><br/>
In 2021, Apple unveiled the &zwnj;iPhone 13&zwnj; as the successor to the popular &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 12, with improved rear cameras, longer battery life, the A15 Bionic chip, and more. The &zwnj;iPhone 14&zwnj; launched one year later, with the headline upgrade being a new &zwnj;iPhone 14&zwnj; Plus model with a 6.7-inch display – a screen size that was previously exclusive to Apple's "Pro" iPhones. Upon the debut of the &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj;, Apple dropped the price of the &zwnj;iPhone 13&zwnj;, &zwnj;iPhone 14&zwnj;, and &zwnj;iPhone 14&zwnj; Plus to &#36;599, &#36;699, and &#36;799, respectively. The &zwnj;iPhone 13&zwnj; mini has now been discontinued.<br/>
<br/>
The &zwnj;iPhone 13&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPhone 14&zwnj; both feature the same display size, 5G connectivity, A15 Bionic chip, and design. Nevertheless, the &zwnj;iPhone 14&zwnj; still offers a number of upgrades, such as an additional GPU core, Emergency SOS via satellite, the Photonic Engine, and Action Mode.<br/>
<br/>
As the &zwnj;iPhone 13&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPhone 14&zwnj; share the overwhelming majority of their features and have the same design, should you consider sticking with the &zwnj;iPhone 13&zwnj; to save money? Our guide helps to answer the question of how to decide which of these two &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; models is best for you, and serves as a way to clearly see the differences that the &zwnj;iPhone 14&zwnj; brings to the table.<br/>

<br/>
The &zwnj;iPhone 14&zwnj;'s upgrades over the &zwnj;iPhone 13&zwnj; are fairly minor, offering small refinements in terms of photography and videography capabilities, battery life, and GPU performance. 6GB of memory, Crash Detection and Emergency SOS via satellite, three features that also came to the &zwnj;iPhone 14&zwnj; Pro and &zwnj;iPhone 14&zwnj; Pro Max in 2022, are moderate upgrades for the safety-conscious. That being said, the &zwnj;iPhone 14&zwnj; is probably best suited to those coming from an older device and intend to keep their &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; for a long time.<br/>

<br/>
At face value, there is likely not enough to justify getting the &zwnj;iPhone 14&zwnj; over the &zwnj;iPhone 13&zwnj;. Matters may be different if you want a larger display size, as there is no equivalent to the &zwnj;iPhone 14&zwnj; Plus in the &zwnj;iPhone 13&zwnj; lineup. Even then, the &zwnj;iPhone 14&zwnj; Plus's &#36;799 starting price is the same as the &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; – one of Apple's latest models. The &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; sports a wide array of new features, such as the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/dynamic-island/">Dynamic Island</a>, a 48-megapixel camera, a USB-C port, and more, making for a much more attractive and future-proof purchase. <br/>

The &zwnj;iPhone 13&zwnj; is still highly capable for everyday use, and &zwnj;iPhone 14&zwnj; shares the vast majority of the &zwnj;iPhone 13&zwnj;'s most versatile features, such as the A15 Bionic chip, OLED Super Retina XDR display, Ceramic Shield, Night mode, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe-battery-pack/">MagSafe</a>, and IP68 water resistance, so it is generally better to save the &#36;100 and get the older model, or opt for the &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; instead.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-13/">iPhone 13</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-14/">iPhone 14</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99">iPhone</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone-13-vs-iphone-14/">iPhone 13 vs. iPhone 14 Buyer&#039;s Guide: Comparing Apple&#039;s Mid-Range iPhones in 2023</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-13-vs-iphone-14-buyers-guide-comparing-apples-mid-range-iphones-in-2023.2356048/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Today marks the 12th anniversary of Apple's co-founder and former CEO Steve Jobs <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2011/10/05/steve-jobs-has-passed-away/">passing away</a> at the age of 56, following a cancer diagnosis.<br/>

Apple shared the following message on its website when Jobs passed away:<blockquote>Apple has lost a visionary and creative genius, and the world has lost an amazing human being. Those of us who have been fortunate enough to know and work with Steve have lost a dear friend and an inspiring mentor. Steve leaves behind a company that only he could have built, and his spirit will forever be the foundation of Apple.</blockquote>Apple still has a <a href="https://www.apple.com/stevejobs/">"Remembering Steve" page</a> on its website with condolences shared by customers around the world following his death in 2011.<br/>
<br/>
"There is not a day that goes by that we don't think about him," said Apple CEO Tim Cook, during the first media event at Steve Jobs Theater in September 2017.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple is preparing to release new 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models with more power-efficient mini-LED displays before the year is out, claims a new report by <em><a href="https://www.digitimes.com/news/a20231004PD213.html">DigiTimes</a></em>. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/macbook-pro-green.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-901497" /><blockquote>Apple is expected to ship new models of 14- and 16-inch MacBook Pro devices in the fourth quarter of 2023 with miniLED backlighting that can increase the display brightness by 10% compared to the first-generation specifications, the sources said.</blockquote>Perhaps counterintuitively on first reading, the claim is that the increased brightness the enhanced mini-LED displays are capable of will not result in perceivably brighter displays on the MacBook Pro. Instead, the mini-LEDs will output the same brightness but use less power in the process. From the report:<br/>
<blockquote>Apple has not made major changes to the miniLED backlighting specifications since adopting it for its tablets and notebooks, the sources said. But the upcoming MacBook Pro devices will feature miniLEDs that are 10% brighter than the previous ones without changing the number of miniLED chips in the backlighting module, the sources said. The brightness enhancement is not meant to improve picture quality, but rather to save power and improve battery life, the sources said, adding that the new devices will start shipping in the fourth quarter of 2023.</blockquote>These claims are not out of the question, but there's good reason to doubt the launch timing in <em>DigiTimes</em>' latest supply chain report. Apple updated the 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro with M2 Pro and ‌M2‌ Max chips in January, and most rumors suggest refreshed models are coming next year. <br/>
<br/>
<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/07/23/new-macbook-pro-and-mac-mini-with-m3-2024-launch/">According to <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman</a>, the next version of these two machines are expected to feature M3 Pro and M3 Max chips and will "probably" launch by the middle of 2024 at the latest. Likewise, Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo believes new MacBook Pro models with updated 3-nanometer M3 Pro and M3 Max chips are <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/01/17/macbook-pro-2024-m3-pro-max/">set to launch in 2024</a>. <br/>
<br/>
Having said that, <em>MacRumors</em> received information earlier this week that indicates Apple will likely begin <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/03/trade-in-changes-may-indicate-new-mac-this-month/">accepting some of its latest Mac models for trade-in</a> this month, suggesting it may be proceeding with plans to release a new Mac model imminently. Whether this correlates with the launch of at least one new machine around mid-October remains to be seen.<br/>
<br/>
The second part of the report is more aligned with rumor consensus, and goes on to suggest that the iPad Pro series may give up mini-LED backlighting and switch to hybrid OLED in 2024, while the MacBook Pro devices will continue using mini-LED until 2026, citing the burn-in problem usually associated with OLED screens as a remaining concern given that laptops tend to be left on for extended periods. <br/>
<br/>
Apple is widely rumored to be working on OLED technology for future Macs and iPads, and the company is expected to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/09/2024-oled-ipad-pro-starting-prices/">switch iPad Pro models to OLED displays next year</a>. iPad Pro display sizes are expected to see a slight increase from 11 and 12.9 inches currently to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/12/29/oled-ipads-2024/">11.1 and 13 inches</a> with the next models. Apple is rumored to be planning to start mass production at the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/07/07/ipad-pro-oled-display-mass-production-early-2024/">beginning of 2024</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile, the 14 and 16-inch MacBook Pro models are not expected to be upgraded with OLED display technology <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/04/macbook-pro-not-getting-oled-until-2026/">until 2026</a>. That is when Apple's supply chain is expected to have sufficient notebook-optimized OLED display production capacity, according to Ross Young, CEO of Display Supply Chain Consultants. Until then, Young believes suppliers will be focused on OLED displays for tablets, such as the iPad Pro, although an OLED MacBook Air <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/30/13-4-inch-oled-macbook-air-rumor/">could come earlier</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<em>DigiTimes</em> obtains its information from the suppliers who manufacture parts for iPhones and other Apple products. Its sources often provide reliable information, but the site has a mixed track record when it comes to interpreting that information and accurately deciphering Apple's plans. It is often best to view information from the site with some skepticism until the info is corroborated by additional sources, especially when it comes to rumors.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro/">MacBook Pro 14 & 16" </a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/digitimes-com/">DigiTimes</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Pro_16">14" & 16" MacBook Pro (Caution)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macbook-pro.90">MacBook Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/05/new-14-16-inch-macbook-pro-models-2023/">Apple to Launch 14-Inch and 16-Inch MacBook Pro Models With More Power-Efficient Displays This Year, Claims Report</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-to-launch-14-inch-and-16-inch-macbook-pro-models-with-more-power-efficient-displays-this-year-claims-report.2406409/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Back in 2018, Apple held talks with DuckDuckGo to replace Google as the default search engine in private browsing mode, but ultimately rejected the idea, according to transcripts unsealed by the judge overseeing the US government's antitrust trial against Google in Washington.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/06/duckduckgo.jpg" alt="" width="1300" height="773" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-745060" /><br/>
Testifying in closed sessions, DuckDuckGo CEO Gabriel Weinberg said that his company had about 20 meetings and phone calls with Apple executives, including the head of Safari, in 2018 and 2019 about becoming the default search engine for private browsing mode. <br/>
<br/>
According to <em><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-10-04/apple-considered-switch-to-search-engine-duckduckgo-from-google?srnd=technology-vp">Bloomberg</a></em>, Apple did not move forward with the deal because John Giannandrea, who joined Apple as head of search in 2018, assumed that since DuckDuckGo relies on Bing for its search information, it also likely provides Microsoft some user information. <br/>
<br/>
That led Giannandrea to believe that DuckDuckGo's privacy marketing is "somewhat incongruent with the details." In a February 2019 email to other Apple executives, Giannandrea said it was therefore "probably a bad idea" to switch to DuckDuckGo for private browsing in Safari.<br/>
<br/>
If Apple seriously wanted to switch to DuckDuckGo, "I would probably insist on doing a lot more due diligence with DuckDuckGo," he said. <br/>
<br/>
The trial is between the U.S. Department of Justice and Google, with the DoJ pointing toward Google's dominance on Apple devices as evidence that Google has a search engine monopoly. A multi-billion dollar deal between Apple and Google sees that Google is set as the default search engine on the iPhone, iPad, and Mac.<br/>
<br/>
Last week the trial revealed that Microsoft considered <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/28/microsoft-bing-acquisition-talks/">selling</a> its Bing search engine to Apple. Had the acquisition happened, Bing would have replaced Google as the default search engine on Apple devices.<br/>
<br/>
Apple's services chief ‌Eddy Cue‌ also had to testify, and he <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/26/apple-on-why-google-is-default-on-iphone/">explained</a> why Google is the ‌iPhone‌'s default search engine. "We make Google be the default search engine because we've always thought it was the best," Cue said. He went on to say that Apple has not gone with another search engine provider because there is no "valid alternative."<br/>

While Google is the default search engine on Apple devices, users can choose to swap to Yahoo, Bing, DuckDuckGo, or Ecosia as an alternative. <div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/google/">Google</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-privacy/">Apple Privacy</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/duckduckgo/">DuckDuckGo</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/05/apple-considered-duckduckgo-default-private-search/">Apple Considered Making DuckDuckGo Default Search Engine in Safari Private Browsing Mode</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-considered-making-duckduckgo-default-search-engine-in-safari-private-browsing-mode.2406400/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple has <a href="https://investor.apple.com/investor-relations/default.aspx">announced</a> that it will report its earnings results for the fourth quarter of the 2023 fiscal year on Thursday, November 2. The report will be available at 1:30 p.m. Pacific Time on that day, and Apple's CEO Tim Cook and CFO Luca Maestri will discuss the results on a conference call with analysts at 2:00 p.m. Pacific Time.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/iPhone-15-Pro-lineup.jpg" alt="" width="2880" height="1620" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-910338" /><br/>
A live audio stream of the call will be available on Apple's <a href="https://www.apple.com/investor/earnings-call/">Investor Relations page</a>, and a recording will be available later in the day for replay.<br/>
<br/>
The quarter ran from July 2 through September 30. During this period, Apple's key product launches included the iPhone 15 lineup, Apple Watch Series 9, Apple Watch Ultra 2, and updated AirPods Pro with a USB-C charging case.<br/>
<br/>
Apple has not provided formal guidance since early 2020, but analysts expect the company to report quarterly revenue of around &#36;89.2 billion on average, according to <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/analysis?p=AAPL">Yahoo Finance</a>. Apple reported &#36;90.1 billion revenue in the year-ago quarter.<br/>
<br/>
Maestri provided the following commentary on Apple's earnings call last quarter:<blockquote>We expect our September quarter year-over-year revenue performance to be similar to the June quarter, assuming that the macroeconomic outlook doesn't worsen from what we are projecting today for the current quarter.</blockquote>AAPL closed at &#36;173.66 today, down from a 52-week high of &#36;198.23.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/earnings/">Earnings</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/aapl/">AAPL</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/04/apple-q4-2023-earnings-results-date/">Apple to Report Earnings on November 2 Following iPhone 15 Launch</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-to-report-earnings-on-november-2-following-iphone-15-launch.2406383/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

Notably, this means that it is no longer possible to downgrade an iPhone from iOS 17 to iOS 16. It is not possible to downgrade to iOS 16.7.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/04/apple-releases-ios-17-0-3/">released iOS 17.0.3</a> with a fix for an issue that may cause <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/30/apple-responds-to-iphone-15-pro-overheating/">iPhone 15 Pro models to run warmer than expected</a>. The software update also includes other important bug fixes and <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT213961">security updates</a>, according to Apple.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/iOS-17.0.3-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-915213" /><br/>
In a <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT213892">support document</a>, Apple revealed that iOS 17.0.3 includes several enterprise-related bug fixes. The update resolves an issue where devices managed via Apple Business Essentials are unable to complete setup after updating to iOS 17, and it fixes bugs related to managed Wi-Fi networks and Microsoft Exchange event invitations.<br/>
<br/>
From the support document:<blockquote><strong>iOS 17.0.3</strong><br/>
<br/>
- Resolves an issue where Apple Business Essentials users were unable to complete setup after updating to iOS 17.<br/>
- iOS 17 devices no longer become unresponsive when joining a managed Wi-Fi network.<br/>
- The Calendar app will no longer resend invitations to all participants after accepting or declining an Exchange event invitation.</blockquote>The device enrollment issue with Apple Business Essentials had been <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/applehelp/comments/16muwkz/apple_business_essentials_ipad_stuck_on/">mentioned on Reddit</a>.<br/>
<br/>
iOS 17.0.3 is available for the iPhone XS and newer. The update can be installed in the Settings app under General → Software Update.<br/>
<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today <a href="https://developer.apple.com/safari/download/">released a new update</a> for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/safari-technology-preview/">Safari Technology Preview</a>, the experimental browser Apple <a href="http://www.macrumors.com/2016/03/30/apple-safari-technology-preview-browser/">first introduced</a> in March 2016. Apple designed the &zwnj;Safari Technology Preview&zwnj; to test features that may be introduced into future release versions of Safari.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-785724" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/02/Safari-Technology-Preview-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2368" height="1332" /><br/>
&zwnj;Safari Technology Preview&zwnj; 180 includes fixes and updates for Accessibility, CSS, JavaScript, Loading, Media, Web Animations, and Web API.<br/>
<br/>
The current &zwnj;Safari Technology Preview&zwnj; release is compatible with machines running macOS Ventura and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sonoma/">macOS Sonoma</a>, the latest version of macOS that Apple released in September 2023. <br/>
<br/>
The &zwnj;Safari Technology Preview&zwnj; update is available through the Software Update mechanism in System Preferences or System Settings to anyone who has <a href="https://developer.apple.com/safari/download/">downloaded the browser</a>. Full release notes for the update are available <a href="https://developer.apple.com/safari/technology-preview/release-notes/">on the Safari Technology Preview website</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Apple's aim with &zwnj;Safari Technology Preview&zwnj; is to gather feedback from developers and users on its browser development process. &zwnj;Safari Technology Preview&zwnj; can run side-by-side with the existing Safari browser and while designed for developers, it does not require a developer account to download.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/safari-technology-preview/">Safari Technology Preview</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/04/apple-releases-safari-technology-preview-180/">Apple Releases Safari Technology Preview 180 With Bug Fixes and Performance Improvements</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-releases-safari-technology-preview-180-with-bug-fixes-and-performance-improvements.2406351/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple is currently testing iOS 17.1, the first major update to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a> operating system that came out in September. Apple plans to release iOS 17.1 later in October, so we still have several betas to go before the software sees a public debut.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/iOS-17.1-Feature-Fall.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-915265" /><br/>
In this guide, we've rounded up all of the feature additions and changes in the iOS 17.1 beta, and we'll be updating it throughout the testing period.<br/>
<h2 id="apple_music_favorites">Apple Music Favorites</h2><br/>
You can favorite songs, albums, playlists, and artists in the iOS 17.1 Music app. Favorited music is added to the Library and improves recommendations. Favoriting replaces the prior "Love" system and favoriting can be done from the Lock Screen's Now Playing widget.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-914260" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/apple-music-favorite.jpg" alt="" width="1290" height="822" /><br/>
A star next to a track in an album means that it's a favorite, while a dot is next to the most played track. With the favorites system, the Music app is suggesting songs to add to playlists.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-914261" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/apple-music-song-suggestions.jpg" alt="" width="1290" height="1229" /><br/>
Eventually, Apple plans to provide a Favorite Songs playlist and offer collaborative playlists, but these features do not appear to be implemented as of yet.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="apple_music_playlists">Apple Music Playlists</h2><br/>
iOS 17.1 provides color-matched playlist artwork options that can be selected as a new customization option for your playlists. There are eight artwork styles that feature geometric shapes and gradients, with the colors featured pulled from the album artwork of the first song in the playlist.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-914404" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/iOS-17-Playlist-Artwork-Feature-1.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" /><br/>
<h2 id="airdrop_over_internet">AirDrop Over Internet</h2><br/>
AirDrop transfers can now be completed over a cellular connection or Wi-Fi if you walk out of the range of the person you're sharing with. That means you will not have to stay close to someone if you are transferring a large number of files.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-914263" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/ios-17-1-airdrop.jpg" alt="" width="1290" height="1796" /><br/>
There is a new "Out of Range" toggle in the AirDrop section of the Settings menu that you can toggle to allow or disallow transfers over cellular.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="play_favorite_songs_quick_action">Play Favorite Songs Quick Action</h2><br/>
If you long press on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/">Apple Music</a> icon on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/home-screen/">Home Screen</a>, you can now choose a "Play Favorite Songs" option.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="double_tap_on_apple_watch">Double Tap on Apple Watch</h2><br/>
Double Tap is enabled in the watchOS 10.1 update that is also in beta testing, and the settings for it can be managed using the Apple Watch app.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-915258" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/watchos-10-1-double-tap.jpg" alt="" width="2901" height="1632" /><br/>
<br/>
Double Tap allows <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch/">Apple Watch Series 9</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch-ultra/">Apple Watch Ultra 2</a> owners to tap their thumb and index fingers together to control the Apple Watch with one hand. The gesture can be used for opening up the Smart Stack, answering/ending calls, playing/pausing music, stopping alarms and timers, and more.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="standby_display_options">StandBy Display Options</h2><br/>
Apple added a new "Display" section to the StandBy section of the Settings app, which houses some new customization options. The display can be set to turn off automatically, after 20 seconds, or never.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-915259" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/standby-display-settings-ios-17-1.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" /><br/>
The existing <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/night-mode/">Night Mode</a> function that adds a red tint and dims the screen has been relocated to this section, as has the Motion to Wake toggle. The Display section also replaces the prior Always On toggle that limited the display to turning off intelligently.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="uk_bank_balances_in_the_wallet_app">UK Bank Balances in the Wallet App</h2><br/>
UK users can <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-seeds-first-betas-of-ios-17-1-and-ipados-17-1-to-developers.2405112/post-32568420">add their UK bank accounts</a> to the Wallet app in iOS 17.1, allowing them to see their account balances, payments, purchases, and deposits.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-914320" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/uk-bank-account-apple-wallet-2.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" /><br/>
<h2 id="books_app">Books App</h2><br/>
The "Reading Now" section in the Apple Books app has been renamed to "Read Now."<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="dynamic_island_flashlight_indicator">Dynamic Island Flashlight Indicator</h2><br/>
When the flashlight is activated on an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-14/">iPhone 14</a> Pro, &zwnj;iPhone 14&zwnj; Pro Max, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a>, or &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; Plus, there is now a flashlight icon in the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/dynamic-island/">Dynamic Island</a> that lets you know that It is on. The flashlight icon for the &zwnj;Dynamic Island&zwnj; was previously limited to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a> and &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; Max.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-914275" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/dynamic-island-flashlight.jpg" alt="" width="1179" height="561" /><br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="controller_support">Controller Support</h2><br/>
iOS 17.1 <a href="https://x.com/aaronp613/status/1707161935358157268?s=20">includes support</a> for the Nintendo Switch N64 Controller.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="extend_wallpaper">Extend Wallpaper</h2><br/>
When you are setting up a new wallpaper, Apple has added an "Extend" option that can be used if the image does not fit the display.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="photo_shuffle">Photo Shuffle</h2><br/>
When you add a Photo Shuffle Lock Screen in iOS 17.1, you can select a specific album of photos that will be shown on the Lock Screen rather than having to rely on Apple's pre-selected options like People, Pets, or Nature.<br/>
<br/>
When selecting any of the main Photo Shuffle images, you're brought into a customization screen where you can choose your Favorites album or opt for any other album you have created, giving you complete control over the images that show up on the Lock Screen. There was previously a tool for manually selecting photos, but being able to choose an entire album is quicker.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-915205" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/ios-17-1-photo-shuffle.jpg" alt="" width="2595" height="2796" /><br/>
Photo Shuffle frequency remains the same at on tap, on lock, hourly, or daily.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="reachability">Reachability</h2><br/>
On iPhones with a &zwnj;Dynamic Island&zwnj;, you'll now see a black background when you use the Reachability feature. In prior versions of &zwnj;iOS 17&zwnj;, a blurred version of the device's wallpaper was shown. The change to a black background prevents the &zwnj;Dynamic Island&zwnj; from being displayed twice when Reachability is used.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-915195" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/ios-17-1-reachability.jpg" alt="" width="1363" height="767" /><br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="journal_app">Journal App</h2><br/>
There is no sign of the promised Journal app in iOS 17.1, but there are mentions of Journaling Suggestions in the code, which indicates that it could be coming before too long.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="80_charging_limit_fix">80% Charging Limit Fix</h2><br/>
With the &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; models, Apple added a toggle that prevents the devices from charging past 80 percent in order to keep the battery healthy for a longer period of time. In &zwnj;iOS 17&zwnj;, the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> could ignore this setting and charge past 80 percent, but that no longer happens following the second beta update.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-915260" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/ios-17-1-80-percent-charge.jpg" alt="" width="2166" height="1218" /><br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Award-winning iPhone camera app <a href="http://halide.cam/download">Halide</a> was today updated for iPhone 15 Pro models, and features a set of in-app triggers that work with the devices' new Action button. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/halide-action-button.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-915427" /><br/>
With the Halide 2.13 app open on an iPhone 15 Pro or iPhone 15 Pro Max, the Action button can be pressed to trigger manual focus, auto/manual exposure, RAW capture, 12/48-megapixel capture, cycle through lenses, take a picture, and more.<br/>
<br/>
To achieve the feat, Halide developers built a custom Shortcut that when selected in iOS Settings ➝ Action Button, automatically triggers a pre-set option in the app's dedicated new Action button menu when the app is active. <br/>
<ul><li><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/iphone-15-pro-how-to-customize-action-button/">iPhone 15 Pro: How to Customize the Action Button</a></li></ul><br/>
During setup, Halide's Action button menu explains to users how to set up custom triggers. Alternatively, users can set the Action button to enable a single-click "Open Halide" shortcut or open a Shortcut Menu with a list of options. <br/>
<br/>
In addition, Halide includes new optimizations for capturing with 5× telephoto on iPhone 15 Pro Max, taking advantage of zero shutter lag for iPhone 15 Pro, and other enhancements. <br/>
<br/>

<a href="http://halide.cam/download">Halide 2.13</a> is a free update for existing users. There's a free one-week trial of the app, after which users can choose an annual &#36;11.99 subscription or a &#36;59.99 one-time purchase.

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today released an iOS 17.0.3 update for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>, with the software coming a week after the launch of iOS 17.0.2. Apple has also released a new version of iPadOS, 17.0.3, for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> users.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/iOS-17.0.3-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-915213" /><br/>
The iOS 17.0.3 and iPadOS 17.0.3 updates can be downloaded on eligible iPhones and iPads over-the-air by going to Settings > General > Software Update.<br/>
<br/>
iOS 17.0.3, which is build 21A360, addresses a significant overheating issue on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a> and &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; Max. Shortly after the new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a> models launched, customers began complaining that the &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; and Pro Max were getting too warm, and even shutting down due to heat problems in some cases.<br/>
<br/>
Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/30/apple-responds-to-iphone-15-pro-overheating/">confirmed that there was a bug</a> in late September, and said that it would be fixed with an update to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a>. Some third-party apps had also been overloading the A17 Pro chip, leading to problems with heat dissipation. Apps affecting performance included Instagram, Uber, and more, and in addition to releasing an update to address the &zwnj;iOS 17&zwnj; issue, Apple has also been working with app developers to optimize apps causing problems.<br/>
<br/>
In comments to <em>MacRumors</em>, Apple clarified that customers experiencing temperature problems would see the issue resolved with an update, and that the titanium frame of the &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/30/apple-iphone-15-pro-overheating-details/">is not at fault</a>. Apple analyst <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/">Ming-Chi Kuo</a> claimed that the overheating was likely caused by "compromises made in the thermal system design," and he suggested that Apple would only be able to fix the issue by lowering processor performance.<br/>
<br/>
Apple said that it has no intention of tweaking the A17 Pro chip, and that the titanium and aluminum design of the &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; in fact provides better heat dissipation than the stainless steel frames used in previous models.<br/>
<br/>
The iOS 17.0.3 and iPadOS 17.0.3 updates also <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT213961">address a kernel vulnerability</a> that could allow an attacker to gain elevated privileges. Apple claims that it is aware that this security flaw was exploited on versions of iOS before iOS 16.6. <div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-17/">iPadOS 17</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-17.241">iOS 17</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-17.242">iPadOS 17</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/04/apple-releases-ios-17-0-3/">Apple Releases iOS 17.0.3 With Fix for iPhone 15 Pro Overheating</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-releases-ios-17-0-3-with-fix-for-iphone-15-pro-overheating.2406303/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

The second public iOS 17.1 and iPadOS 17.1 betas come a week after the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/28/apple-seeds-ios-17-1-public-beta-1/">release of the first betas</a>.<br/>

<br/>
Apple added an option to favorite songs, albums, playlists, artists, and more, from within <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/">Apple Music</a> and through the Now Playing widget.<br/>
<br/>
AirDrop transfers can now be finished over the internet after being initiated, and when you activate the flashlight, there's an indicator in the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/dynamic-island/">Dynamic Island</a> even if you don't have an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a> or Pro Max.

		<description><![CDATA[Apple this week began selling the seven-year-old Beats Solo3 wireless on-ear headphones in <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MT283LL/A/beats-solo3-wireless-headphones-gold">Gold and Silver color options</a> again for &#36;199.95 on its online store. The headphones also remain available in Black, Rose Gold, and (PRODUCT)RED.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/Beats-Solo3-Gold.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="675" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-915448" /><br/>
Apple previously offered the Beats Solo3 in Satin Gold and Satin Silver, but the colors had been discontinued in late 2020.<br/>
<br/>
Released in 2016, the Beats Solo3 are now very old headphones with outdated technologies, such as micro-USB charging and Bluetooth 4.0, but they do have a W1 chip for quick and easy pairing with Apple devices. The headphones are more affordable than the new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/07/19/beats-studio-pro-debut/">Beats Studio Pro</a>, which are regularly priced at &#36;349.95.<br/>
<br/>
It's unclear how long Apple will continue to sell the Solo3, so keep in mind that the headphones could be discontinued sooner rather than later.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/beats/">Beats</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/04/beats-solo3-now-available-in-gold-and-silver/">Apple&#039;s Old Beats Solo3 Headphones Available in Gold and Silver Again</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apples-old-beats-solo3-headphones-available-in-gold-and-silver-again.2406288/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Google today refreshed its product lineup with new Pixel smartphones, a new Pixel watch, and updated Pixel earbuds, all of which will compete with Apple devices.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/google-pixel-announcements.jpg" alt="" width="2060" height="1159" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-915310" /><br/>
The Pixel 8 and Pixel 8 Pro are Google's latest smartphones, and the Pixel 8 Pro is the high-end model that has all of Google's most recent technological advancements. It features a 6.7-inch 1 to 120Hz display, similar to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a> Max, while the standard Pixel 8 has a 120Hz 6.2-inch display.<br/>
<br/>
Google has updated the design of its Pixel smartphones, adding a polished aluminum frame and matte glass for the Pro and a satin metal frame and polished back glass for the standard Pixel. Google says the devices have softer silhouettes compared to the prior-generation models, and they come in new colors. Google is using Gorilla Glass Victus for both, but the Pro has Corning's Gorilla Glass Victus 2 for better durability.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/google-pixel-8-and-8-pro.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-915318" /><br/>
The Pixel 8 and Pixel 8 Pro are equipped with Google's Tensor G3 chip with enhanced AI capabilities that can filter out more spam calls, improve image processing, erase background noise from videos, and boost call quality. There's also a Titan <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m2/">M2</a> security chip, and with this combo, the Pixel phones have facial recognition secure enough to be used to sign in to apps and make payments.<br/>
<br/>
According to Google, the triple-lens rear camera system of the Pixel 8 Pro features better performance in low light and improvements to zoom and video capture Google added a new Video Boost technology for HDR+ and enhanced color grading, and the camera also supports Night Sight Video.<br/>
<br/>
With the updated Tensor chip, Google is promising that the Pixel 8 devices will get operating system and security updates for seven years, which will rival what Apple delivers with iOS.<br/>
<br/>
One of the main selling points of the Pixel 8 Pro is a new thermometer, which can tell you the temperature of an object with just a camera scan. Google is also touting updated Google Assistant functionality, with the Assistant able to translate, read aloud, and summarize web pages, as well as distill key points about what's on the screen.<br/>
<br/>
The Pixel 8 Pro is priced starting at &#36;999, which is the same starting price as Apple's &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj;, and the Pixel 8 is priced starting at &#36;699. Best Buy is currently offering pre-order bonuses for both devices, with <a href="https://howl.me/ckIMzlP4MXC">Pixel 8 Pro purchases including a free Pixel Watch 2</a> and <a href="https://howl.me/ckIMzmouv1Q">Pixel 8 pre-orders including free Pixel Buds Pro</a>, with more details on those devices below. Pre-order customers can also receive up to &#36;800 off with a qualified trade-in.<br/>
<br/>
Google's new smartphones were introduced alongside the Pixel Watch 2 (<a href="https://howl.me/ckIMATg3ne2">&#36;349.99 for Wi-Fi</a> and <a href="https://howl.me/ckIMASGbw3K">&#36;399.99 for cellular</a>), which incorporates more advanced heart rate tracking and stress detection from Fitbit. There are new body-response and skin temperature sensors that work alongside heart rate and heart rate variability to detect potential signs of stress or reactions from alcohol, caffeine, and other substances.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/pixel-watch-2.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-915312" /><br/>
The Pixel Watch 2 directly adopts an Apple feature, Safety Check. Google says that with Safety Check, you can let friends and family know where you are, setting a timer for a check in. When that timer expires, Safety Check prompts you to confirm that you are okay, and if there is no response, real-time location information is shared with emergency contacts.<br/>
<br/>
As for battery life, the Pixel Watch 2 is now able to last for up to 24 hours, and it charges to full in 75 minutes. Design wise, it is lighter than the prior model, and it has a thinner domed cover over the circular face.<br/>
<br/>
Google is also updating the <a href="https://howl.me/ckIMFeCRY5e">&#36;199.99 Pixel Buds Pro</a> with new colors and new AI-powered features such as clearer calling for reduced noise, hearing wellness measurements that keep track of how loud your music is, conversation detection that pauses music when you start speaking, and improved latency through a new low-latency mode. Aside from the new colors, the updated feature set is available to all Pixel Buds Pro through a software update.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/pixel-buds-pro.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1113" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-915316" /><br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple CEO Tim Cook netted around &#36;41.5 million after taxes this week after selling 511,000 shares of Apple stock that he received as part of a performance-based award, according to a <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/320193/000032019323000089/xslF345X05/wk-form4_1696381457.xml">filing</a> released by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/05/Tim-Cook-MacBook-16x9.jpeg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-894618" /><br/>
The stock award was determined based on Apple's total shareholder return relative to the other companies in the S&P 500 between the first day of Apple's 2021 fiscal year and the final day of Apple's 2023 fiscal year. Based on this metric, Apple ranked 141 of the 480 companies that were included in the S&P 500.<br/>
<br/>
Cook still owns nearly 3.3 million shares of Apple following the sale, the filing indicates.<br/>
<br/>
Cook was awarded an additional 73,010 restricted stock units, with one-third of the units to vest on April 1 each year in 2026, 2027, and 2028. He was also awarded 219,030 performance-based restricted stock units that are scheduled to vest on October 1, 2026, but this amount is subject to change based on Apple's S&P 500 performance.<br/>
<br/>
In a 2015 interview with <em><a href="https://fortune.com/2015/03/26/tim-cook/">Fortune</a></em>, Cook said that he planned to give away all his wealth, after paying for his nephew's college education. Cook said that he would take a "systematic approach to philanthropy."<br/>
<br/>
Cook has been CEO of Apple since 2011, and he has worked at the company for 25 years.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tim-cook/">Tim Cook</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/aapl/">AAPL</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/04/tim-cook-nets-41-million-from-apple-stock-sale/">Tim Cook Nets &#36;41.5 Million After Selling Over 500,000 Apple Shares</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/tim-cook-nets-41-5-million-after-selling-over-500-000-apple-shares.2406274/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The Apple Watch Series 9 and Apple Watch Ultra 2 have been out for a few weeks now, and Amazon is still offering launch discounts on both wearables. You can get &#36;9 off the Apple Watch Series 9 and up to &#36;25 off the Apple Watch Ultra 2, with no coupon code required.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/Apple-Watch-Series-9-and-Ultra-2-Deals-2.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-913210" /><em><small>Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with Amazon. When you click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment, which helps us keep the site running.</small></em><br/>
<br/>
Although not particularly steep discounts, Amazon's prices are solid for anyone who's planning to pick up one of the new Apple Watches soon. Most models can be delivered as soon as October 6 for Prime members and around October 9 for free delivery options.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0CHWYVS23%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"target="_blank"><div class="fancybutton"><div class="fancybadge">&#36;25 OFF</div>Apple Watch Ultra 2 for &#36;774.00</div></a></div><br/>
<br/>
Amazon only has one Apple Watch Ultra 2 model at the new all-time low price of <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0CHWYVS23%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"><strong>&#36;774.00</strong></a> (Indigo Alpine Loop, Large). You'll find a large collection of other models at &#36;779.99, which is still a solid &#36;19 discount for these brand new watches. <br/>
<br/>
Another highlight is the 40mm GPS Apple Watch SE at <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0BDJM3151%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"><strong>&#36;219.99</strong></a> with an on-page coupon discount, down from &#36;249.99.
