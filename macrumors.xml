		<description><![CDATA[For this week's giveaway, we've teamed up with <a href="https://www.colorware.com/">ColorWare</a> to offer <em>MacRumors</em> readers a chance to win <a href="https://www.colorware.com/p-1466-colorware-apple-number-2-pencil.aspx?c=variant-15y">a custom Apple Pencil 2</a> that's been painted to look like an actual number 2 pencil.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/colorware-apple-2-pencil-1.jpg" alt="" width="2560" height="1536" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-935830" /><br/>
ColorWare is a company that makes custom-painted Apple products and accessories, and ordering from ColorWare is essentially the only way to get a non-standard color for AirPods, the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-pencil/">Apple Pencil</a>, the Magic Mouse, and AirTags.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/colorware-apple-2-pencil-2.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1000" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-935831" /><br/>
Occasionally, ColorWare comes out with super fun special edition products, such as the new <a href="https://www.colorware.com/p-1466-colorware-apple-number-2-pencil.aspx?c=variant-15y">ColorWare Apple Number 2 Pencil</a>. This is an &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; 2 that has a black tip, yellow body, painted-on eraser, and other detailing for a faithful rendering of a number 2 pencil.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/colorware-apple-2-pencil-3.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1000" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-935832" /><br/>
ColorWare is making a limited number of the Apple Number 2 Pencils, and they're priced at &#36;215. That's an &#36;86 premium over the &#36;129 price tag, but the extra cost is worth it for a unique design that will make your <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> stand out. To get the pencil-like effect, ColorWare has combined matte, metallic, and glossy paints for the pencil, and it comes in a special edition box.<br/>
<br/>
ColorWare has been designing and selling custom-painted devices for more than two decades, and it has perfected the steps needed for a gorgeous, durable finish. ColorWare uses a multi-step coating process that includes a primer, the application of a proprietary color formula, and an X2 liquid plastic coating that protects the color. All ColorWare products are warrantied for 12 months.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/colorware-apple-2-pencil-4.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1000" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-935833" /><br/>

		<description><![CDATA[On this week's episode of <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/podcast/one-week-with-apple-vision-pro-ft-quinn-nelson-snazzy-labs/id1602394741?i=1000644778180">The MacRumors Show</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@snazzy">Snazzy Labs</a>' Quinn Nelson joins us to talk about the first week using Apple's long-awaited Vision Pro headset.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HRpqWpAHBXE?si=KFaZVrW4_0XwAm62" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe><em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@themacrumorsshow?sub_confirmation=1">Subscribe to The MacRumors Show YouTube channel</a> for more videos</em></div><br/>
Now that they each have one, Quinn and Dan discuss whether the Vision Pro meets their expectations. A significant portion of our dialogue is dedicated to the technical aspects of the Vision Pro, including its display quality, brightness, and the challenges users might face with hand gestures and text selection. The conversation progresses to evaluate the device's text sharpness, its implications for productivity, and how comfortable it feels with the two headband options.<br/>
<br/>
An interesting part of our discussion compares the Vision Pro with other VR headsets in the market. We highlight the distinct features of the Vision Pro that set it apart, especially its distortion correction capabilities and suitability for productivity tasks, contrasting it with the Meta Quest's gaming prowess. We also explore the potential for third-party headbands, future customization, and design possibilities, emphasizing Apple's unique position in the VR landscape and its differing approach from rivals.<br/>
<br/>
We ponder the coexistence of Apple and Meta within the VR space, acknowledging the competition but also recognizing the distinctive strengths and target audiences each company caters to. This leads to a broader discussion about the challenges current VR headsets face, such as eye strain, and the optimistic outlook for technological improvements over time that could mitigate these issues.<br/>
<br/>
A considerable part of our discussion tackles the technicalities and challenges surrounding Personas and face scanning with the Vision Pro, including the influence of factors like face shape, hair, and lighting conditions on the accuracy of these features. Quinn also shares insights on the integration of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> apps with the Vision Pro, highlighting how this has transformed his workflow in certain instances and the potential it unlocks for productivity.<br/>
<br/>
Despite the mix of frustrations and amazement the Vision Pro has brought, we come to a consensus acknowledging the exciting possibilities the device offers for the future of VR and productivity, considering whether or not we would recommend Apple's headset to others.<br/>
<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[iOS 18 and iPadOS 18 will feature visionOS-inspired design elements, according to a rumor shared this week by <a href="https://theverifier.co.il/62189/exclusive-apple-ios-18-visionos/">Israeli website <em>The Verifier</em></a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/visionOS-design.jpeg" alt="" width="1800" height="1012" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-935810" /><br/>
For example, the report claims that the Apple TV app on iPadOS 18 will feature the same translucent navigation bar that was <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/26/apple-tv-app-redesign-tvos-17-2/">introduced in the tvOS 17.2 version of the app</a> last year. The design of this menu draws similarities to visionOS, the operating system that runs on Apple's new Vision Pro headset, which launched in the U.S. last week.<br/>
<br/>
Apple also plans to redesign various other system menus and built-in apps on iOS 18, including Safari, according to the report.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/apple-tv-app-redesign.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-918880" /><div class="center-wrap"><em>Apple TV app menu bar on tvOS 17.2</em></div><br/>
We consider this rumor to be "sketchy" because <em>The Verifier</em> has a <a href="https://appletrack.com/the-verifier/">mixed track record</a> with Apple rumors over the years.<br/>
<br/>
Apple will introduce iOS 18 at its annual developers conference WWDC in June, and the first beta should be available shortly after the announcement. The update will be released to all users in September alongside the iPhone 16 lineup.

		<description><![CDATA[With much of the tech industry's focus recently taken up by <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple's Vision Pro</a> headset, you'd be forgiven for thinking that iPhone rumors have been few and far between over the last few months. Fortunately, that's not the case. Rumors and leaks about the iPhone 16 series continue to surface, and taken together, Apple's next-generation 2024 smartphone lineup looks like it could turn out to be a major upgrade.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/12/iPhone-16-Pro-Sizes-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-927877" /><br/>
To bring you up to speed, we've summarized below the biggest iPhone 16 rumors we've covered so far here on <em>MacRumors</em>. For more details, follow the links, or dive into our dedicated roundups for both <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/">iPhone 16 Pro</a> models, which are expected to arrive in September.<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px; color: #4A90E2; margin-top: 2px;"><br/>
    1. Larger Displays</span><br><br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 14px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #4A90E2; padding: 3px 6px; border-radius: 4px; margin-bottom: 2px;">Biggest Ever iPhones</span><br><br/>
This year's iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max are rumored to be getting <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/08/iphone-16-pro-larger-display-sizes/">bigger display sizes</a>, increasing to 6.27- and 6.86-inches, respectively. For comparison, the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max are equipped with 6.1-inch and 6.7-inch displays, respectively. The new display sizes would be the largest ever for the iPhone.<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px; color: #4A90E2; margin-top: 2px;"><br/>
    2. Vertical Camera Layout</span><br><br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 14px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #4A90E2; padding: 3px 6px; border-radius: 4px; margin-bottom: 2px;">iPhone 16 & iPhone 16 Plus</span><br><br/>
Apple's iPhone 16 base models will feature a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/06/apple-iphone-16-slim-camera-bump/">vertical camera arrangement</a> with a pill-shaped raised surface, instead of a diagonal camera arrangement like the iPhone 15. The new camera bump features two separate camera rings for the Wide and Ultrawide cameras. The vertical camera layout is expected to enable Spatial Video recording, which is currently limited to the iPhone 15 Pro models.<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px; color: #4A90E2; margin-top: 2px;"><br/>
3. Battery Changes</span><br><br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 14px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #4A90E2; padding: 3px 6px; border-radius: 4px; margin-bottom: 2px;">All iPhone 16 Models</span><br><br/>
One rumor suggests the ‌iPhone 16‌ and iPhone 16 Pro Max will feature <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/07/some-iphone-16s-to-feature-bigger-batteries/">larger batteries</a> than their predecessors, but the ‌iPhone 16‌ Plus may have reduced capacity. The iPhone 16 is said to have a 6% increase over the iPhone 15, with the iPhone 16 Pro Max gaining a 5% increase. In contrast, the iPhone 16 Plus is rumored to have a 9% reduction in capacity. On the other hand, Apple could also potentially use <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/07/25/iphone-15-hybrid-lens-rumor/">stacked battery technology</a> to increase energy density and prolong lifespan. <br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px; color: #4A90E2; margin-top: 2px;"><br/>
4. Capture Button</span><br><br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 14px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #4A90E2; padding: 3px 6px; border-radius: 4px; margin-bottom: 2px;">New Camera Capabilities</span><br><br/>
All iPhone 16 models will have a new "<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/18/iphone-16-capture-button-touch-pressure/">Capture Button</a>" dedicated to triggering image or video capture. The button will add features like the ability to zoom in and out by swiping left and right on the button, focus on a subject with a light press, and activate a recording with a more forceful press. The Capture Button will be located on the bottom right side of the ‌iPhone 16, and will take the place of the mmWave antenna on U.S. ‌iPhone‌ models, with the antenna relocating to the left side of the device below the volume and Action buttons.<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px; color: #4A90E2; margin-top: 2px;"><br/>
5. Ultra Wide Lens Upgrade</span><br><br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 14px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #4A90E2; padding: 3px 6px; border-radius: 4px; margin-bottom: 2px;">iPhone 16 Pro & iPhone 16 Pro Max</span><br><br/>
The iPhone 16 Pro models are expected to feature an upgraded <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/15/iphone-16-pro-wifi-7-48mp-ultra-wide-rumors/">48-megapixel Ultra Wide camera lens</a>, which should allow it to capture more light, resulting in improved photos when shooting in 0.5× mode, especially in low-light environments. This also means that iPhone 16 Pro models should be able to shoot 48-megapixel ProRAW photos in Ultra Wide mode. These photos retain more detail in the image file for more editing flexibility, and can be printed at large sizes.<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px; color: #4A90E2; margin-top: 2px;"><br/>
5. Super Telephoto Camera</span><br><br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 14px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #4A90E2; padding: 3px 6px; border-radius: 4px; margin-bottom: 2px;">iPhone 16 Pro Max</span><br><br/>
The iPhone 16 Pro Max could be the first to feature a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/07/18/iphone-16-pro-max-super-telephoto-camera/">super telephoto periscope camera</a> for dramatically increased optical zoom. "Super" or "ultra" telephoto usually describes cameras with a focal length of over 300mm. The current telephoto lens is equivalent to a 77mm lens, so if accurate, there could be a notable increase in zoom capabilities. Super telephoto cameras are often used for sports and wild animal photography, but the extremely soft backgrounds they create also make them useful for portrait photography, providing there is enough distance between the subject and the photographer.<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px; color: #4A90E2; margin-top: 2px;"><br/>
6. Faster Wi-Fi Support</span><br><br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 14px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #4A90E2; padding: 3px 6px; border-radius: 4px; margin-bottom: 2px;">Wi-Fi 6E & Wi-Fi 7</span><br><br/>
Apple's 2024 iPhone Pro models are expected to get <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/15/iphone-16-pro-wifi-7-48mp-ultra-wide-rumors/">Wi-Fi 7 in the Pro models</a>, enabling data transfer over the 2.4GHz, 5GHz, and 6GHz bands simultaneously. This should result in faster Wi-Fi speeds, lower latency, and more reliable connectivity. With technologies such as 4K QAM, Wi-Fi 7 is  also expected to offer peak data transfer speeds of over 40 Gbps, a 4× increase over Wi-Fi 6E. Meanwhile, the iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/14/iphone-16-and-16-plus-8gb-ram-rumor/">rumored to support Wi-Fi 6E</a>, which works with the 6 GHz band, enabling faster wireless speeds and reduced signal interference.<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px; color: #4A90E2; margin-top: 2px;"><br/>
7. New AXX Series Chips</span><br><br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 14px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #4A90E2; padding: 3px 6px; border-radius: 4px; margin-bottom: 2px;">A17 & A18 Pro Variants</span><br><br/>
Apple's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/27/iphone-16-lineup-a18-a18-pro-chips-analyst-says/">next-generation A18 Pro chip</a> is expected to be manufactured with TSMC's second-generation 3nm process, known as N3E. All four iPhone 16 models will be equipped with A18-branded chips, according to one rumor. Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/25/iphone-16-first-chip-designed-for-standard/">another rumor</a> counter-claims that the iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus will have A17 chips made using a different manufacturing process to the A17 Pro in the iPhone 15 Pro. The ‌iPhone 15 Pro‌'s A17 Pro chip is fabricated using TSMC's N3B process, but Apple reportedly plans to switch to the lower-cost N3E process for next year's standard A17 chip designed for the ‌iPhone 16‌ and ‌iPhone 16‌ Plus. <br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px; color: #4A90E2; margin-top: 2px;"><br/>
7. 5G Qualcomm Modem</span><br><br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 14px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #4A90E2; padding: 3px 6px; border-radius: 4px; margin-bottom: 2px;">iPhone 16 Pro & iPhone 16 Pro Max</span><br><br/>
Apple is expected to use <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/12/iphone-16-pro-5g-advanced-rumor/">Qualcomm's latest Snapdragon X75 modem</a> in this year's Pro and Pro Max models. The Snapdragon X75 includes improved carrier aggregation and other technology advancements for faster 5G download and upload speeds compared to the X70, which is used in iPhone 15 models. The modem's combined mmWave and sub-6GHz 5G transceiver also takes up 25% less circuit board space, and is said to use up to 20% less power. The standard iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus are expected to retain the Snapdragon X70 modem.<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px; color: #4A90E2; margin-top: 2px;"><br/>
8. Tetraprism Lens</span><br><br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 14px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #4A90E2; padding: 3px 6px; border-radius: 4px; margin-bottom: 2px;">iPhone 16 Pro</span><br><br/>
Both iPhone 16 Pro models are <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/18/iphone-16-pro-tetraprism-lens-rumor/">expected to feature 5x optical zoom</a>, which is currently exclusive to the iPhone 15 Pro Max. Apple's tetraprism lens system has a "folded" design that allows it to fit inside the smartphone, enabling up to 5x optical zoom and up to 25x digital zoom. In contrast, the current smaller iPhone 15 Pro is limited to up to 3x optical zoom, which is in line with the iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max.<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px; color: #4A90E2; margin-top: 2px;"><br/>
10. Micro-Lens Technology</span><br><br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 14px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #4A90E2; padding: 3px 6px; border-radius: 4px; margin-bottom: 2px;">More Efficient OLED</span><br><br/>
Apple is said to be weighing up the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/01/iphone-16-oled-displays-micro-lens-efficiency/">use of micro-lens technology</a> to maintain or increase the brightness of OLED displays on next year's iPhone 16 models while potentially reducing their power consumption. MLA works by using a uniform pattern of billions of lenses inside the panel that reduces internal reflections. These lenses turn the path of light reflected backwards from the inside of the panel towards the screen, which can serve either to increase perceived brightness while maintaining the same level of power consumption, or maintain brightness levels while consuming less power compared to conventional OLED panels at the same luminance.<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px; color: #4A90E2; margin-top: 2px;"><br/>
11. Action Button</span><br><br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 14px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #4A90E2; padding: 3px 6px; border-radius: 4px; margin-bottom: 2px;">iPhone 16 & iPhone 16 Plus</span><br><br/>
The iPhone 15 Pro models include an Action Button, and in 2024, the Action Button is expected to be <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/30/iphone-16-action-button-all-models/">expanded to the standard iPhone 16 models</a>. The Action Button used across the iPhone 16 lineup will be identical to the iPhone 15 Pro Action Button. The Action button, which replaces the traditional mute switch, can perform multiple functions such as activating the Flashlight, turning on the Camera, launching a Shortcut, enabling or disabling a Focus mode, using Translate, turning on/off Silent Mode, and more.<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px; color: #4A90E2; margin-top: 2px;"><br/>
12. Generative AI</span><br><br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 14px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #4A90E2; padding: 3px 6px; border-radius: 4px; margin-bottom: 2px;">Large Language Models</span><br><br/>
With iOS 18, Apple is rumored to be introducing new features powered by large language models (LLMs), although additional cutting-edge generative AI features could be <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/09/iphone-16-exclusive-ai-features-ios-18/">limited to the iPhone 16 models</a>. Apple is developing a large array of features that use generative AI, including a smarter version of Siri, improved interactions between Siri and the Messages app, auto-generated Apple Music playlists, integration with productivity apps for AI-assisted content creation, and more. <br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px; color: #4A90E2; margin-top: 2px;"><br/>
13. Upgraded Microphone</span><br><br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 14px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #4A90E2; padding: 3px 6px; border-radius: 4px; margin-bottom: 2px;">Enhanced Siri</span><br><br/>
Apple is said to be planning a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/07/apple-iphone-16-microphone-upgrade-siri-ai/">significant upgrade</a> to the iPhone 16 microphone to improve the new AI-enhanced Siri experience. Apple's Siri AI ambitions will heavily rely on improved voice input processing, and the new mic is expected to offer significantly enhanced signal-to-noise ratio.<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px; color: #4A90E2; margin-top: 2px;"><br/>
14. New Thermal Design</span><br><br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 14px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #4A90E2; padding: 3px 6px; border-radius: 4px; margin-bottom: 2px;">Reduced Heat</span><br><br/>
Apple is rumored to be working on a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/16/iphone-16-new-thermal-design/">graphene thermal system</a> for the ‌iPhone 16‌ lineup, while the ‌iPhone 16‌ Pro models could add metal battery casings to reduce overheating. Graphene has high thermal conductivity, surpassing that of copper, which is currently used in iPhone heat-sinks. Apple has been filing patents related to using graphene for thermal management for some time. The move could be in response to widely encountered overheating issues experienced with the iPhone 15 Pro, which Apple addressed through a software update.<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px; color: #4A90E2; margin-top: 2px;"><br/>
15. Expanded Storage</span><br><br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 14px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #4A90E2; padding: 3px 6px; border-radius: 4px; margin-bottom: 2px;">Both iPhone 16 Pro Models</span><br><br/>
The iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max will be available with double the maximum storage capacity as the iPhone 15 Pro models, increasing from 1TB to 2TB, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/19/iphone-16-pro-2tb-option-rumor/">according to one rumor</a>. The move is said to be a result of Apple's switch to higher-density Quad-Level Cell (QLC) NAND flash for higher storage models. Apple's use of QLC NAND could allow Apple to fit more storage into a smaller space and it is less expensive than Triple-Level Cell (TLC) NAND, which current iPhones use. On the downside, QLC has comparatively slower read and write speeds.<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px; color: #4A90E2; margin-top: 2px;"><br/>
15. Increased Memory</span><br><br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 14px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #4A90E2; padding: 3px 6px; border-radius: 4px; margin-bottom: 2px;">iPhone 16 & iPhone 16 Plus</span><br><br/>
Apple's iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus models have been rumored to both <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/14/iphone-16-and-16-plus-8gb-ram-rumor/">feature 8GB of RAM</a>, an increase over the 6GB of RAM in the iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus. More working memory should equate to improved performance for multitasking on the iPhone.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/">iPhone 16 Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/09/every-iphone-16-rumor-weve-covered-so-far/">Every iPhone 16 Rumor We&#039;ve Covered So Far</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/every-iphone-16-rumor-weve-covered-so-far.2419007/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Following a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2020/05/20/spotify-signs-up-the-joe-rogan-experience-podcast/">three-year absence</a>, the hugely popular and controversial podcast <em>The Joe Rogan Experience</em> is back on Apple Podcasts after Spotify gave up exclusivity as part of a multiyear deal renewal with Rogan.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/05/elon-musk-joe-rogan.jpg" alt="" width="1440" height="825" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-742668" /><div class="center-wrap"><em>(Image credit: POWERFULJRE/YOUTUBE)</em></div><br/>
In a <a href="https://x.com/joerogan/status/1755735654225334432?s=20">post on X</a> (formerly Twitter), Rogan on Thursday said that "the podcast is now officially back on @apple. We should be back on @youtube with full episodes in the coming weeks."<br/>
<br/>
Under the new deal, which is said to be worth up to &#36;250 million, Rogan's show will be available on other content platforms, including Apple Podcasts, Amazon Music, and YouTube. The move is part of Spotify's revised strategy to forego exclusive streaming rights in favor of broader distribution.<br/>
<br/>
As part of the renewed deal, first reported by <em><a href="https://www.wsj.com/business/media/joe-rogan-podcast-spotify-deal-28eb5f74">The Wall Street Journal</a></em>, Spotify will handle distribution and ad sales for the podcast. Rogan will receive a guaranteed minimum fee from Spotify as well as a cut of advertising revenue.<br/>
<br/>
"For more than three years, <em>The Joe Rogan Experience</em> has consistently been the No. 1 podcast across the globe," Spotify said when it announced the renewed deal last week. That accords with Edison Research's Q3 2023 survey of most listened-to podcasts, in which <em>The Joe Rogan Experience</em> ranked number 1 for the period. It was also the second most listened-to podcast for women 13 and older in the U.S., according to Edison.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The podcast is now officially back on <a href="https://twitter.com/Apple?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@apple</a><br>We should be back on <a href="https://twitter.com/YouTube?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@youtube</a> with full episodes in the coming weeks.

Since launching in December 2009, Rogan's podcast has involved candid and varied discussions on topics like politics, health, and society. In recent years it has gained notoriety through Rogan's practice of inviting guests that hold extreme or unconventional views. The show has also faced significant criticism for spreading misinformation and giving a platform to divisive figures.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-podcasts/">Apple Podcasts</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/09/joe-rogan-experience-apple-podcasts/">&#039;The Joe Rogan Experience&#039; Returns to Apple Podcasts After 3-Year Hiatus</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/the-joe-rogan-experience-returns-to-apple-podcasts-after-3-year-hiatus.2418999/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[EU developers can now add alternative app marketplaces to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a> Connect, <a href="https://developer.apple.com/news/releases/">Apple said today</a>. Apple is also accepting submissions for the Notarization process, which is required for all apps that will be distributed through alternative marketplaces.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/App-Store-vs-EU-Feature-2.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-932826" /><br/>
Apple is making these changes to &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; Connect ahead of the launch of iOS 17.4, an update that <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/25/ios-17-4-alternative-app-marketplaces-eu/">overhauls the app ecosystem in the European Union</a>. Alternative app marketplaces are special iOS apps that can be downloaded onto an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> from a website or a web browser, serving as an alternative to the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj;. App marketplaces are able to distribute iOS apps, giving developers a way to sell their apps without using the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
Both alternative marketplaces and apps that are added to the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; through one of the marketplaces are checked over by Apple to prevent malware, viruses, and similar malicious content.<br/>
<br/>
To add an alternative app marketplace or submit an app for Notarization, developers must <a href="https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=e59yuu15">agree to Apple's new business terms</a>. The business terms include a Core Technology Fee that requires app marketplaces to pay .50 euros per install, and apps to pay the same fee after 1 million installs.<br/>
<br/>
With alternative app marketplaces able to be added to &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; Connect, marketplace distribution and marketplace apps can be set up, and TestFlight can be used to beta test new features.<br/>
<br/>
TestFlight also supports apps that use alternative browser engines and alternative payments through third-party payment providers.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-developer-program/">Apple Developer Program</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store-connect/">App Store Connect</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/08/app-store-connect-alternative-app-marketplaces/">Apple Starts Letting Developers Add Alternative App Marketplaces to App Store Connect</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-starts-letting-developers-add-alternative-app-marketplaces-to-app-store-connect.2418959/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple is currently testing <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/visionos/">visionOS</a> 1.1, the first major update to the &zwnj;visionOS&zwnj; operating system that runs on the Vision Pro. &zwnj;visionOS&zwnj; 1.1 updates Personas, and multiple reports suggest the software makes Personas look better than before. We thought we'd take a closer look at Personas in &zwnj;visionOS&zwnj; 1.1, comparing the update to the prior &zwnj;visionOS&zwnj; 1.0.2 software.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xEixxDkYXlo" title="Apple Vision Pro Persona FIXED in visionOS 1.1?" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe><em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/macrumors?sub_confirmation=1">Subscribe to the MacRumors YouTube channel</a> for more videos.</em></div><br/>
Personas are a key feature on the Vision Pro, representing the user in video calls on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/facetime/">FaceTime</a>, Zoom, and other platforms. Personas are a digital representation of the Vision Pro wearer, and are captured using the headset itself. With the Vision Pro, the wearer takes a 3D facial scan that captures their facial structure, expressions, hand movements, and more. Apple describes a Persona as an "authentic spatial representation" of a person.<br/>
<br/>
Apple released Personas in a beta capacity, and it's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/31/apple-vision-pro-personas-deeply-weird/">not hard to see why</a> with the Personas that have been shared on the initial versions of the &zwnj;visionOS&zwnj; software. Reviewers have called personas "deeply weird," "deep in the uncanny valley," "ridiculous," and "frightening."<br/>
<br/>
With &zwnj;visionOS&zwnj; 1.1, Personas have more natural looking eyes, skin tone improvements, and more detail that adds realism, though Apple's scanning feature still struggles with hair.<br/>
<br/>
Most Personas are noticeably better with the 1.1 update, but Apple still needs to do a lot of work to eliminate the otherworldly, unnatural vibe that the virtual representations give off. &zwnj;visionOS&zwnj; 1.1 is available to developers in beta right now, and it will likely see a launch in March alongside iOS 17.4.<br/>
<br/>
The update also adds Contact Key Verification, support for resetting the headset without a computer, and support for mobile device management.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AppleVisionPro">Vision Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-vision-pro.209">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/08/testing-personas-visionos-1-1/">Testing Improved Vision Pro Personas in visionOS 1.1</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/testing-improved-vision-pro-personas-in-visionos-1-1.2418951/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The latest Tesla software adds Ultra Wideband support (UWB) to improve the function of the built-in Phone Key feature in the Tesla app (via <em><a href="https://teslanorth.com/2024/02/08/tesla-phone-key-iphone-ultra-wideband/">Tesla North</a></em>). Tesla owners can use Phone Key to lock and unlock their vehicles without a physical key.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/12/tesla-red-orange-bg-feature.jpg" alt="" width="1560" height="827" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-776244" /><br/>
Ultra Wideband support provides more precise tracking capabilities than Bluetooth, which means the Phone Key feature will better recognize when an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> is near a vehicle to unlock/lock it at the appropriate time. From the release notes:<br/>
<blockquote>Ultrawide band (UWB) technology is now available for Phone Key. So your vehicle and Phone Key can communicate with greater accuracy to more responsively lock, unlock, and open Automatic Doors.</blockquote><br/>
Tesla owners will need both a vehicle that supports Ultra Wideband and an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; with Ultra Wideband to take advantage of the new capabilities. Enabling the updated UWB key requires going to the Phone Key section of the Tesla app (which must be upgraded to version 4.29.5) and following the upgrade steps.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tesla/">Tesla</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/08/tesla-app-ultra-wideband/">Tesla App Gains Ultra Wideband Support to Improve Phone Keys</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/tesla-app-gains-ultra-wideband-support-to-improve-phone-keys.2418945/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Popular password management app LastPass <a href="https://blog.lastpass.com/2024/02/warning-fraudulent-app-impersonating-lastpass-currently-available-in-apple-app-store/">is warning customers</a> about a fraudulent app that uses a similar name and icon to attempt to trick LastPass customers into using the fake app instead of the real app (via <em><a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/fake-lastpass-password-manager-spotted-on-apples-app-store/">Bleeping Computer</a></em>).<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/lasspass-fake-password-manager-app.jpg" alt="" width="2838" height="1596" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-935681" /><br/>
The "LassPass Password Manager" app was somehow approved by Apple's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a> review team, even though it appears to clearly mimic the LastPass app. It doesn't use exactly the same icon and the name is a letter off, but the similarities could confuse some LastPass users.<br/>
<br/>
It is unclear if the fake LassPass app is attempting to steal login information from users, but it does have options for adding passwords, email accounts, addresses, bank accounts, credit cards, debit cards, and more. It doesn't ask for a LastPass login of any kind, but it is possible that the developer can see information added to the app.<br/>
<br/>
There is also a "PRO" upgrade that costs &#36;1.99 per month, &#36;9.99 per year, or &#36;49.99 for a "lifetime" subscription, so the aim of the app may be collecting subscription money from customers. Either way, LastPass users should be aware of the fake app and should avoid it. At best it is aiming to steal money, and at worst, it is stealing passwords and credit card information.<br/>
<br/>
Clone apps often make their way into the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj;, but the app impersonating LastPass is particularly concerning because it could be accessing sensitive information. It is not clear how an app mimicking one of the most popular password management apps was approved by Apple, and its discovery comes at a critical time for the company.<br/>
<br/>
Apple has been <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/03/phil-schiller-on-risks-of-iphone-app-marketplaces/">promoting the safety and security</a> of the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; as it prepares to allow for alternate app marketplaces in the European Union, and allowing a fake password management app onto the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; is not a good look.<br/>
<br/>
LastPass contacted Apple to get the clone app removed from the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj;, and it was pulled at around 11:00 a.m. Pacific Time on February 8. <br/>
Apple removed the fraudulent LassPass app because it violated the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; rule preventing copycat apps. The developer has also been removed from the Apple Developer Program and won't be able to submit future apps. <div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/lastpass/">LastPass</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/08/fake-lastpass-app-in-apple-app-store/">Fake LastPass App Sneaks Past Apple&#039;s Review Team</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/fake-lastpass-app-sneaks-past-apples-review-team.2418924/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

<br/>
There are a few more MacBook Pro models on sale compared to the MacBook Air deal, and these are also at all-time low prices. It's worth noting that the MacBook Pro deals will require you to have a My Best Buy Plus or Total membership in order to see the record low prices, but even without one you can find some solid second-best prices on Best Buy.<br/>
<br/>
Starting with the M3 512GB 14-inch MacBook Pro, you can get this model for <a href="https://howl.me/clALsjD0UdF"><strong>&#36;1,399.00</strong></a> with a My Best Buy Plus/Total membership, down from &#36;1,599.00. The M3 Pro 512GB 14-inch MacBook Pro is on sale for <a href="https://howl.me/clALtdDDDQt"><strong>&#36;1,749.00</strong></a>, down from &#36;1,999.00, which is a best-ever deal we haven't tracked since the holidays.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><em><strong>Note: My Best Buy Plus/Total membership required to see final deal price.</strong></em></div><br/>

<br/>
Moving to 16-inch models, Best Buy has the M3 Pro 512GB/18GB Memory 16-inch MacBook Pro for <a href="https://howl.me/clALyhaPV7d"><strong>&#36;2,249.00</strong></a>, down from &#36;2,499.00. You can also get the M3 Pro 512GB/36GB Memory 16-inch MacBook Pro for <a href="https://howl.me/clALzNTz4c4"><strong>&#36;2,649.00</strong></a>, down from &#36;2,899.00.

		<description><![CDATA[While most reports so far have agreed that the next iPhone SE will have a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/09/iphone-se-4-iphone-14-chassis/">similar design as the standard iPhone 14 model</a>, which has a notch for Face ID, a sketchy rumor now says that the device will instead feature the Dynamic Island.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/iPhone-SE-Dynamic-Island-Majin-Bu.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-935672" /><div class="center-wrap"><em>iPhone SE with Dynamic Island mockup by <a href="https://twitter.com/upintheozone">@upintheozone</a></em></div><br/>
This latest claim comes <a href="https://twitter.com/MajinBuOfficial/status/1755615656400294225">from the leaker @MajinBuOfficial on X</a>, formerly known as Twitter. In addition to the Dynamic Island, he said the next iPhone SE could have a vertical rear camera bump like the one <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/06/apple-iphone-16-slim-camera-bump/">rumored for the iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus</a>, but with one camera instead of two. Based on the information he shared, the rear microphone and LED flash would be positioned below the camera lens in a pill-shaped bump.<br/>
<br/>
@MajinBuOfficial recently shared alleged iPhone 16 schematics that are <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/06/apple-iphone-16-slim-camera-bump/">believed to be accurate</a>. However, he has a mixed track record with Apple rumors, and he cautioned that this iPhone SE information is still unconfirmed for now. In addition, Apple is likely prototyping multiple iPhone SE models, and it may not have finalized a design.<br/>
<br/>
The next iPhone SE is expected to launch in 2025, around three years after the current model was released, but this timeframe could change.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-se/">iPhone SE</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/majin-bu/">Majin Bu</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone_SE">iPhone SE (Caution)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99">iPhone</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/08/iphone-se-dynamic-island-rumor/">Sketchy Rumor Says Next iPhone SE Will Feature Dynamic Island Instead of Notch</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/sketchy-rumor-says-next-iphone-se-will-feature-dynamic-island-instead-of-notch.2418916/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<title>iOS 17.4 Nerfs Web Apps in the EU</title>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple has seemingly restricted the functionality of Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) in the latest beta of iOS 17.4, specifically targeting users within the European Union. The move appears to undermine the role of PWAs as viable alternatives to native apps in iOS.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/iOS-17.4-Feature-Triad.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-932464" /><br/>
As first flagged by security researcher <a href="https://x.com/mysk_co/status/1753401847044288847?s=20">Tommy Mysk</a> and <a href="https://open-web-advocacy.org/blog/did-apple-just-break-web-apps-in-ios17.4-beta-eu/">Open Web Advocacy</a>, the second beta release of iOS 17.4 seems to introduce changes that put web apps at a significant disadvantage in Europe. The new beta version of iOS prevents these apps from launching in their own top-level window that takes up the entire screen, relegating them instead to open within Safari, a change that significantly impacts their user experience and functionality. The move effectively demotes PWAs to mere website shortcuts.<br/>
<br/>
Now, when a user in Europe taps a web app icon, they will see a system message asking if they wish to open it in Safari or cancel. The message adds that the web app "will open in your default browser from now on." When opened in Safari, the web app opens like a bookmark, with no dedicated windowing, notifications, or long-term local storage. Users have seen issues with existing web apps such as data loss, since the Safari version can no longer access local data, as well as broken notifications.<br/>
<br/>
Progressive Web Apps are designed to offer a user experience comparable to that of native apps using web technologies, with the potential for users to add them directly to their home screen with no need for an app store. The latest change is particularly controversial because historically Apple has suggested that developers who are unwilling to comply with its <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a> guidelines could instead focus on web apps. Now, the company's recent adjustments appear to contradict this stance by limiting the capabilities of PWAs and their ability to compete with native applications in iOS, raising questions about its commitment to supporting web technologies as a viable alternative to the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
This development comes amid Apple's moves to comply with the European Union's Digital Markets Act (DMA), which aims to promote competition and regulate the practices of digital "gatekeepers." Apple's decision to alter the functionality of PWAs specifically in the EU could be interpreted as an attempt to navigate the regulatory landscape imposed by the DMA, but it may simply want to prevent users in Europe from using web apps with alternative browser engines. The company has not yet commented on its motivations.<br/>
<br/>
There are indications that iOS 17.4 is using SIM carrier information to geo-lock the changes to web app functionality singularly to users in the EU. Web apps in other regions around the world remain unaffected.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/european-union/">European Union</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/08/ios-17-4-nerfs-web-apps-in-the-eu/">iOS 17.4 Nerfs Web Apps in the EU</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-17-4-nerfs-web-apps-in-the-eu.2418904/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple and other top tech companies have joined a new U.S. consortium to support the safe and responsible development and deployment of generative AI, the Commerce Department announced on Thursday (via <em><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-02-08/top-ai-companies-join-government-effort-to-set-safety-standards">Bloomberg</a></em>).<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/NIST-AI-consortium.jpg" alt="" width="3900" height="2323" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-935590" /><div class="center-wrap"><em>Image credit: <a href="https://www.nist.gov/artificial-intelligence/artificial-intelligence-safety-institute">NIST</a></em></div><br/>
Apple, along with OpenAI, Microsoft, Meta, Google, and Amazon, will join more than 200 members of the AI Safety Institute Consortium (AISIC) under the department, Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said.<br/>
<br/>
"The U.S. government has a significant role to play in setting the standards and developing the tools we need to mitigate the risks and harness the immense potential of artificial intelligence," Raimondo said in a statement.<br/>
<br/>
The group will work with the department's National Institute of Standards and Technology on priority actions outlined in <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2023/10/30/executive-order-on-the-safe-secure-and-trustworthy-development-and-use-of-artificial-intelligence/">President Biden's AI executive order</a>, "including developing guidelines for red-teaming, capability evaluations, risk management, safety and security, and watermarking synthetic content."<br/>
<br/>
Other technology companies, as well as civil society groups, academics, and state and local government officials, will also be involved to establish safety standards regarding AI regulation. <br/>
<br/>
Generative AI has spurred excitement due to its potential to enhance creativity, improve efficiency, and advance technology. However, fears surrounding generative AI include ethical concerns like deepfakes, the potential impact on jobs, issues around information reliability, and challenges in ensuring privacy and effective regulation. <br/>
<br/>
Apple is said to be spending <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/06/apple-conversational-ai-spending/">millions of dollars a day</a> on AI research as training large language models requires a lot of hardware. Apple is on track to spend <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/23/apple-ai-server-spending-2024/">more than &#36;4 billion</a> on AI servers in 2024, according to one report.<br/>
<br/>
Apple is said to be <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-gpt/">developing its own generative AI model</a> called "Ajax". Designed to rival the likes of OpenAI's GPT-3 and GPT-4, Ajax operates on 200 billion parameters, suggesting a high level of complexity and capability in language understanding and generation. Internally known as "Apple GPT," Ajax aims to unify machine learning development across Apple, suggesting a broader strategy to integrate AI more deeply into Apple's ecosystem.<br/>
<br/>
Aspects of the model could be incorporated into iOS 18, such as an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/06/ios-18-siri-improvements/">enhanced version of Siri</a> with ChatGPT-like generative AI functionality. Both <em>The Information</em> and analyst Jeff Pu claim that Apple will have some kind of generative AI feature available on the ‌iPhone‌ and iPad <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/19/apple-generative-ai-late-2024-jeff-pu/">later this year</a>.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-gpt/">Apple GPT</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/08/apple-ai-safety-institute-consortium/">Apple Joins US Commerce Department&#039;s AI Safety Institute Consortium</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-joins-us-commerce-departments-ai-safety-institute-consortium.2418893/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>
