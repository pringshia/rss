		<description><![CDATA[In iOS 17.1, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/27/ios-17-1-beta-1-features/">currently in beta</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> users in the UK can now view the account balance of their bank cards and credit cards right within Apple's Wallet app. Keep reading to learn how it works.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/uk-bank-account-apple-wallet-2.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-914320" /><br/>
Apple's Wallet app on &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; has been able to display <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-pay/">Apple Pay</a> transactions made using your bank and credit cards for a while now, but if you are a Wallet app user in the United Kingdom, a new integration in iOS 17.1 means you can view your current account balance from your bank, along with a history of your deposits and payments. If you have a credit card, you can also view your remaining credit.<br/>
<br/>
To get the additional account information, your bank needs to support the Open Banking API that Apple has implemented. Supporting banks currently include Barclays, Monzo, Startling, HSBC, Lloyds, and RBS, with more banks likely to come on board when iOS 17.1 is released to the public.<br/>
<br/>
The following steps show you how integration is securely authorized through the Wallet app. It's a simple enough process, and Apple will automatically redirect you to your bank app to authenticate the connection. Note that until iOS 17.1 is officially released, <strong>the iOS 17.1 developer beta must be installed on your iPhone</strong> for this to work.<br/>
<ol><li>Open the Wallet app on your &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;.</li><br/>
<li>Tap a card from a supporting bank.</li><br/>
<li>Tap <strong>Get Started</strong> under "See Balances and Full Transaction History for This Account."</li><br/>
<li>Tap <strong>Continue</strong> to connect your account to Wallet.</li><br/>
<li>Check the account details that you are about to give Wallet permission to access, then tap <strong>Continue</strong>.</li><br/>
<li>In your bank app, enter your &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;'s passcode or use <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mask-face-id/">Face ID</a> to grant Wallet permission to access the specified account details.</li></ol><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/view-uk-bank-account-balance-apple-wallet.jpg" alt="" width="4137" height="2716" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-914317" /><br/>
<br/>
After following these steps, you'll be directed back to the Wallet app, where you will now see the available balance of your account underneath the bank card, along with your transaction history. If it's a credit card, you'll also see the remaining balance available, while a tap on the balance will also reveal your credit limit.<br/>
<br/>
With Apple users in the UK still unable to make use of Apple Cash or <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-card/">Apple Card</a>, it's nice to see Apple exclusively supporting a British banking standard in its Wallet app. Note that Open Banking is UK-specific: No US equivalent is currently available.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/united-kingdom/">United Kingdom</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-wallet/">Apple Wallet</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/view-uk-bank-account-balance-apple-wallet/">How to View Your UK Bank Account Balance and Deposits in Apple Wallet</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/how-to-view-your-uk-bank-account-balance-and-deposits-in-apple-wallet.2405247/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Former Apple designer Jony Ive and OpenAI's Sam Altman are in advanced talks with SoftBank's Masayoshi Son to launch a &#36;1 billion venture to build "the iPhone of artificial intelligence," according to the <em><a href="https://www.ft.com/content/4c64ffc1-f57b-4e22-a4a5-f9f90a7419b7">Financial Times</a></em>. The news follows a report on Wednesday that <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/27/jony-ive-openai-design-ai-hardware/">claimed</a> Ive and Altman are in discussions about creating an AI gadget.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/jony-ive.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-914301" /><br/>
According to <em>FT</em>, Altman wants Ive's design agency LoveFrom to help develop the ChatGPT creator's first consumer device. From the paywalled report:<br/>
<blockquote>Altman and Ive have held brainstorming sessions at the designer's San Francisco studio about what a new consumer product centered on OpenAI's technology would look like, the people said.<br/>
<br/>
They hope to create a more natural and intuitive user experience for interacting with AI, in the way that the iPhone's innovations in touchscreen computing unleashed the mass-market potential of the mobile internet.<br/>
<br/>
The process of identifying a design or device remains at an early stage with many different ideas on the table, they said.</blockquote>Son, Softbank's founder and CEO, has been involved in some of the discussions, which have centered around creating a company drawing from Softbank, Altman's OpenAI, and Ive's LoveFrom design agency. <br/>
<br/>
Son is said to be pitching a central role for British chip designer Arm, in which the Japanese conglomerate holds a 90% stake. Son is also offering &#36;1 billion investment in the venture, according to the report.<br/>
<br/>
Ive is said to have been concerned about the compulsive nature of smartphone users' behavior, and the designer sees the project as an opportunity to create a way of interacting with computers that is less reliant on screens.<br/>
<br/>
Discussions are said to be "serious," but no deal has been agreed, and it could be several months before any official announcement, cautioned people with knowledge of the matter. Any resulting device would likely remain years away from launching.<br/>
<br/>
Ive left Apple to begin LoveFrom in 2019, recruiting at least four of his former Apple colleagues to work with him at the firm, including Wan Si, Chris Wilson, Patch Kessler, and Jeff Tiller.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ft-com/">Financial Times</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/jony-ive/">Jony Ive</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/28/jony-ive-iphone-artificial-intelligence-openai/">Jony Ive and OpenAI in Advanced Talks to Build &#039;the iPhone of Artificial Intelligence&#039;</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/jony-ive-and-openai-in-advanced-talks-to-build-the-iphone-of-artificial-intelligence.2405241/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<title>Meta Debuts &#36;500 Quest 3 as Apple Prepares to Launch &#36;3,500 Vision Pro Headset Next Year</title>

		<description><![CDATA[Facebook parent company Meta <a href="https://www.meta.com/quest/quest-3">today announced</a> the upcoming launch of the &#36;500 Meta Quest 3, its newest mixed reality headset that goes up against the much more expensive Vision Pro that Apple plans to launch next year.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/meta-quest-3.jpg" alt="" width="1385" height="779" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-914163" /><br/>
Meta claims that the Quest 3 was redesigned from the inside out, and it features "4K+ Infinite Display resolution" thanks to two displays with a 2064x2208 resolution per eye and an "experimental" 120Hz refresh rate. Comparatively, Apple's headset uses 4K micro-OLED displays and provide a total of 23 million pixels.<br/>
<br/>
The Quest 3 is equipped with 3D spatial audio and a 40 percent louder volume range than the Quest 2. Meta is using Qualcomm's Snapdragon XR2 Gen 2 chip for the headset, and it offers double the GPU processing power of the Meta Quest 2. Meta says with the new chip, the Quest 3 supports "fast-action gaming, seamless full-color, and high-resolution passthrough."<br/>
<br/>
Two RGB cameras with 10x better resolution than the Quest 2 provide a view of the surrounding area, and virtual objects are able to be manipulated in your physical space. This is the augmented reality part of the headset, and it mirrors what's possible with the Vision Pro.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/meta-quest-3-controllers.jpg" alt="" width="1758" height="989" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-914164" /><br/>
The Meta Quest 3 weighs in at 515 grams, which is over a pound, and it is slightly heavier than the Quest 2. There is, however, a slimmer optic profile thanks to new pancake lenses, so Meta says the headset is more comfortable to wear. There is a soft adjustable strap that holds it on the head, and the facial interface can be adjusted to improve comfort and field of view. There is 110 degree horizontal field of view and a 96 degree vertical field of view for extended peripheral vision, plus sharpness in the center field of view has been increased by 25 percent. Unlike Apple's headset, there is no eye tracking or iris scanning.<br/>
<br/>
For input, the Meta Quest 3 uses two Touch Plus Controllers that serve as a "natural extension" of the hands and offer tactile haptic feedback. Meta is using computer vision and machine learning sensors to follow hand gestures, and there are a series of cameras that enable controller-free navigation, which is similar to what's possible with the Vision Pro headset.<br/>
<br/>
The Meta Quest 3 lasts for up to 2.2 hours per charge on average, and it does not include an external battery pack. The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a> also lasts for two hours when connected to its external battery, but it can run all day when hooked up to a power source.<br/>
<br/>
Other features include 8GB RAM, Wi-Fi 6E, an LED that lets people nearby know when cameras are in use, and support for connecting to a PC with the Meta Quest Link Cable and Air Link.<br/>
<br/>
The Meta Quest 3 is priced at &#36;499.99 for 128GB of storage and can be <a href="https://www.meta.com/quest/quest-3">pre-ordered from the Meta website</a> starting today. Orders are set to start arriving in October.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/facebook/">Facebook</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/meta/">Meta</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/27/meta-quest-3/">Meta Debuts &#36;500 Quest 3 as Apple Prepares to Launch &#36;3,500 Vision Pro Headset Next Year</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/meta-debuts-500-quest-3-as-apple-prepares-to-launch-3-500-vision-pro-headset-next-year.2405179/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Yale today announced the launch of the <a href="https://shopyalehome.com/pages/yale-assure-lock-2-plus">Yale Assure Lock 2 Plus</a>, its latest smart lock that has <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/homekit/">HomeKit</a> integration and Apple Home Key support. With Home Key integration in the Wallet app, an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> or an Apple Watch can be used to unlock the door with just a tap.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/yale-home-key-lock.jpg" alt="" width="1510" height="848" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-914168" /><br/>
The Assure Lock 2 Plus is a keyless entry lock, which means it does not have a backup key option. Aside from Home Key, it can be accessed with &zwnj;HomeKit&zwnj; commands or entry codes. The entry codes can be used to provide guests with access, and there is an optional Wi-Fi module for remote access to the lock.<br/>
<br/>
Yale today also debuted the <a href="https://shopyalehome.com/pages/yale-assure-lock-2-touch">Assure Lock 2 Touch</a>, a &#36;199 smart lock that has a fingerprint sensor and &zwnj;HomeKit&zwnj; integration, but no support for Home Key. Yale does not offer a lock that provides both Home Key support and a fingerprint sensor, so those interested in a Yale lock will need to choose.<br/>
<br/>
The <a href="https://shopyalehome.com/pages/yale-assure-lock-2-plus">Yale Assure Lock 2 Plus with Home Key</a> is priced at &#36;210 for Bluetooth connectivity, or &#36;290 for Wi-Fi support. The Wi-Fi models require a 2.4GHz network.<br/>
<br/>
The <a href="https://shopyalehome.com/pages/yale-assure-lock-2-touch">Yale Assure Lock 2 Touch</a> is priced at &#36;199 for the Bluetooth version, with both keyed and key-free models available.

<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/08/mac-studio-pink.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-859358" /><br/>
The entry-level &zwnj;M2&zwnj; Max &zwnj;Mac Studio&zwnj; with 32GB RAM and 512GB SSD is available for &#36;1,699, which is a &#36;300 discount off of the standard &#36;1,999 price. The base model &zwnj;M2&zwnj; Ultra machine with 64GB RAM and a 1TB SSD is priced at &#36;3,399, a &#36;600 discount off of the regular &#36;3,999 price.<br/>
<br/>
Apple is offering multiple &zwnj;M2&zwnj; Ultra and &zwnj;M2&zwnj; Max &zwnj;Mac Studio&zwnj; models for purchase at the current time, and all of them offer similar ~15 percent discounts off of the standard prices. Discounts range from &#36;300 to &#36;1300 depending on configuration and starting price.<br/>
<br/>
The 2023 &zwnj;Mac Studio&zwnj; models were introduced in June 2023 alongside the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-pro/">Mac Pro</a> models. They offer &zwnj;Mac Pro&zwnj; performance and the same &zwnj;M2&zwnj; Ultra chip in a more compact package.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/epic-games/">Epic Games</a> today filed a petition for a writ of certiorari with the Supreme Court, which basically means the company is asking the Supreme Court to make a ruling in its ongoing legal battle with Apple.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/05/app-store-blue-banner-epic-1.jpg" alt="" width="1794" height="1009" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-800065" /><br/>
The Supreme Court is the last stop for &zwnj;Epic Games&zwnj; after it lost an appeal earlier this year. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in April 2023 <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/24/epic-games-loses-appeal-app-store-battle/">sided with the lower court</a> and ruled that Apple's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a> rules do not violate antitrust law by not allowing for third-party marketplaces.<br/>
<br/>
Since 2020, Epic has been pushing for a ruling that would allow it to skirt the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; and offer apps directly to consumers through sideloading or an alternate store, but its legal arguments <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/10/epic-games-vs-apple-decision/">have not been successful</a>. Epic ultimately wants to sell digital skins and other goods to its Fortnite customers without having to give Apple a 30 percent cut of its proceeds.<blockquote>Epic also offers digital goods--such as outfits--that users can purchase for use within Fortnite. Epic has invested vast sums in developing not just Fortnite but those digital add-ons, to which Apple contributes nothing. But Apple required Epic to use its IAP and pay the 30% commission on every in-app purchase that any iPhone user made directly from Epic, no matter how many years after downloading Fortnite from the App Store.</blockquote>Epic's 488 page filing lists several reasons why the Supreme Court should hear the case, focusing on errors made by the lower courts and the significance of the case, as any major &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; change would impact hundreds of thousands of developers.<br/>
<br/>
The Supreme Court could opt not to hear Epic's case, and it only accepts a fraction of the cases that it is asked to review each year.<br/>
<br/>
When the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals made its decision, it upheld the ruling of the lower court, including the mandate that Apple allow developers to direct customers to purchase options outside of the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj;. Apple does not want to make these &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; changes, and so it too may ask the Supreme Court to make a ruling on that portion of the case.<br/>
<br/>
Apple back in in July <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/07/17/app-store-rule-change-epic-games-delayed/">was given 90 days</a> after the appeals court ruling to decide whether it would petition the Supreme Court. Apple has not yet contacted the Supreme Court, nor has it hit that 90 day limit. When the 90-day limit expires, Apple will either need to ask the Supreme Court to hear the case or implement the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; changes that it has been ordered to make.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/epic-games/">Epic Games</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/epic-games-vs-apple/">Epic Games vs. Apple</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/27/epic-games-supreme-court/">Epic Games Asks Supreme Court to Hear Apple Case</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/epic-games-asks-supreme-court-to-hear-apple-case.2405160/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Just a week after releasing <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a>, Apple has seeded the first beta of iOS 17.1 to developers. iOS 17.1 adds some features that Apple promised were coming to &zwnj;iOS 17&zwnj; in the future, plus it refines and improves some existing features.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/iOS-17.1-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-912333" /><br/>
This guide covers everything new in the first iOS 17.1 beta.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Apple Music Favorites</h2><br/>
You can favorite songs, albums, playlists, and artists in the iOS 17.1 Music app. Favorited music is added to the Library and improves recommendations. Favoriting replaces the prior "Love" system and favoriting can be done from the Lock Screen's Now Playing widget.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/apple-music-favorite.jpg" alt="" width="1290" height="822" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-914260" /><br/>
A star next to a track in an album means that it's a favorite, while a dot is next to the most played track. With the favorites system, the Music app is suggesting songs to add to playlists.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/apple-music-song-suggestions.jpg" alt="" width="1290" height="1229" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-914261" /><br/>
Eventually, Apple plans to provide a Favorite Songs playlist and offer collaborative playlists, but these features do not appear to be implemented as of yet.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>AirDrop</h2><br/>
AirDrop transfers can now be completed over a cellular connection or Wi-Fi if you walk out of the range of the person you're sharing with. That means you will not have to stay close to someone if you are transferring a large number of files.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/ios-17-1-airdrop.jpg" alt="" width="1290" height="1796" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-914263" /><br/>
There is a new "Out of Range" toggle in the AirDrop section of the Settings menu that you can toggle to allow or disallow transfers over cellular.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>NameDrop on Apple Watch</h2><br/>
With watchOS 10.1 and iOS 17.1, an Apple Watch and an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> can now be used to exchange contact information through the NameDrop feature.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/08/namedrop-apple-watch.jpg" alt="" width="2501" height="1396" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-906032" /><br/>
<h2>Ringtones and Text Tones</h2><br/>
The more than <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/13/ios-17-ringtones-text-tones/">20 new ringtones and text tones</a> that were added in the launch version of &zwnj;iOS 17&zwnj; have disappeared in the first beta of iOS 17.1, but Apple will likely re-add them in a later update.<br/>
<br/>
Custom tones for Mail and Messages have been re-added.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>UK Bank Balances in the Wallet App</h2><br/>
UK users can <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-seeds-first-betas-of-ios-17-1-and-ipados-17-1-to-developers.2405112/post-32568420">add their UK bank accounts</a> to the Wallet app in iOS 17.1, allowing them to see their account balances, payments, purchases, and deposits.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Books App</h2><br/>
The "Reading Now" section in the Apple Books app has been renamed to "Read Now."<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Journal App</h2><br/>
There is no sign of the promised Journal app in iOS 17.1, but there are mentions of Journaling Suggestions in the code, which indicates that it could be coming before too long.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Dynamic Island Flashlight Indicator </h2><br/>
When the flashlight is activated on an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-14/">iPhone 14</a> Pro, &zwnj;iPhone 14&zwnj; Pro Max, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a>, or &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; Plus, there is now a flashlight icon in the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/dynamic-island/">Dynamic Island</a> that lets you know that It is on. The flashlight icon for the &zwnj;Dynamic Island&zwnj; was previously limited to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a> and &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; Max.<br/>
 <br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/dynamic-island-flashlight.jpg" alt="" width="1179" height="561" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-914275" /><br/>
<h2>Controller Support</h2><br/>
iOS 17.1 <a href="https://x.com/aaronp613/status/1707161935358157268?s=20">includes support</a> for the Nintendo Switch N64 Controller.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Extend Wallpaper</h2><br/>
When you are setting up a new wallpaper, Apple has added an "Extend" option that can be used if the image does not fit the display.<br/>
<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Significant changes are expected to arrive with Apple's fourth-generation <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-se/">iPhone SE</a>, in terms of both design and hardware, <em>MacRumors</em> has learned.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/02/iphone-se-4-modified-flag-edges.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-886982" /><br/>
The &zwnj;iPhone SE&zwnj; 4, known internally under the codename Ghost, is expected to receive a new design derived almost entirely from the base model <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-14/">iPhone 14</a>. According to our sources, the &zwnj;iPhone SE&zwnj; 4 will use a modified version of the &zwnj;iPhone 14&zwnj; chassis and will even maintain &zwnj;iPhone 14&zwnj; test parameters for internal testing. <br/>
<br/>
As far as the chassis is concerned, two major changes are expected – an Action button and a USB-C port. The Action button, recently debuted on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a>, is a multi-purpose button which replaces the mute switch on newer <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> models. It can be configured to perform a variety of actions, depending on the user's preference.<br/>
<br/>
The &zwnj;iPhone SE&zwnj; 4 is also set to receive a USB-C port in order to comply with upcoming European Union regulations. Our sources have seen extensive references to the E85 connector, which is what Apple calls USB-C internally. Apart from these two major differences, no significant changes are planned for the chassis compared to the &zwnj;iPhone 14&zwnj;, and it will likely not feature the curved edges of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a> lineup.<br/>
<br/>
As for the back of the device, the next &zwnj;iPhone SE&zwnj; will feature a single camera with the flash aligned in an arrangement similar to the third-generation &zwnj;iPhone SE&zwnj;. The exact design of the camera bump, however, remains unclear at the time of writing. Apple has developed at least five different designs for the camera bump, with minor differences among them. They fall into two major categories:<br/>
<ul><li>Camera and flash encompassed in a single, oblong-shaped camera bump</li><br/>
<li>Only the camera ring raised from the main backplate surface</li></ul><br/>
Preliminary information suggests that the &zwnj;iPhone SE&zwnj; 4 may feature a 48-megapixel rear camera, providing for a significant upgrade from the current model.<br/>
<br/>
The &zwnj;iPhone SE&zwnj; 4 will also likely receive a new OLED panel, derived from the &zwnj;iPhone 14&zwnj;. The device will not feature a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/touch-id/">Touch ID</a> home button, but will instead have <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mask-face-id/">Face ID</a> as the means of biometric identification. Multiple references to "Pearl," Apple's internal codename for &zwnj;Face ID&zwnj; and associated hardware, have been spotted in relation to the fourth-generation &zwnj;iPhone SE&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
Apple is also working on an in-house 5G modem, codenamed “Sinope”, and is using the &zwnj;iPhone SE&zwnj; 4 to test the new hardware. Current information suggests that the new modem is being tested on the &zwnj;iPhone SE&zwnj; 4 and a derivative of the &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; Max, known as "D84S." Originally, the new 5G modem was meant to make its debut with the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a> lineup, being available across the entire range. According to information from our sources, this may no longer be the case. Additionally, Qualcomm recently issued a press release stating that the company would be providing smartphone modems for Apple until 2026.<br/>
<br/>
Previous claims have suggested that Apple was developing the &zwnj;iPhone SE&zwnj; 4 exclusively for modem testing, and that it was not intended for mass production or release to the general public. This theory seems unlikely, as it does not explain the amount of effort put into the overall design of the device including multiple camera bump iterations, as well as part changes.<br/>
<br/>
If the &zwnj;iPhone SE&zwnj; 4 had been intended exclusively for modem testing, this likely would not necessitate a camera redesign or the inclusion of an Action button. From a pragmatic point of view, it would make more sense to reuse existing parts with only a minimum amount of modification, as was done with the D84S.<br/>
<br/>
It's worth noting that the information presented here is preliminary, pre-preproduction information. The fourth-generation &zwnj;iPhone SE&zwnj; is still early in the development process, and changes are always possible. As a result, the information may not fully align with the specifications of final mass-production units, assuming the project makes it to this stage.<br/>

		<title>New Battery Health Features Remain Limited to iPhone 15 Models on First iOS 17.1 Beta</title>

		<description><![CDATA[All four iPhone 15 models have two new battery health features in the Settings app, including the ability to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/check-battery-cycle-count-iphone-15/">view the battery's cycle count</a> and an option to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/19/iphone-15-80-percent-battery-limit-option/">more strictly limit charging beyond 80%</a>. On <a href="https://twitter.com/BetaProfiles/status/1704476683414409443">social media</a>, some users hoped these features would expand to older iPhone models in a future software update, but we are able to confirm that they remain limited to the iPhone 15 lineup as of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/27/apple-seeds-ios-17-1-beta-1/">first iOS 17.1 beta</a> released today.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/iOS-17-Battery-Cycle-Count-Feature-2.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-914246" /><br/>
It's early in the iOS 17.1 beta testing cycle, so there is still a chance the features are added to older iPhone models in a later beta. However, it's also possible there are hardware-related reasons behind the battery health features being limited to the iPhone 15 lineup. We've reached out to Apple for comment on the matter.<br/>
<br/>
On iPhone 15 models, the 80% charging limit option can be found in the Settings app under Battery → Battery Health & Charging → Charging Optimization. It is separate from the pre-existing Optimized Battery Charging feature on iPhones, which intelligently delays charging past 80% until a more appropriate time by learning the device's daily charging routine. When the 80% limit is enabled, the iPhone will never charge beyond that percentage, except on rare occasions to "maintain accurate battery state-of-charge estimates."<br/>
<br/>
In a <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT210512">support document</a>, Apple says reducing the time that an iPhone battery is fully charged can reduce the wear on the battery and improve its lifespan.<br/>
<br/>
On iPhone 15 models, the battery's cycle count, manufacturing date, and first use date can be viewed in the Settings app under General → About. This information can provide additional insight into the health of the battery. The battery's maximum capacity remains listed under Battery → Battery Health & Charging.<br/>
<br/>
iOS 17.1 is expected to be released in late October.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-17/">iPadOS 17</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-17.241">iOS 17</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-17.242">iPadOS 17</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/27/ios-17-1-battery-health-features-iphone-15-only/">New Battery Health Features Remain Limited to iPhone 15 Models on First iOS 17.1 Beta</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/new-battery-health-features-remain-limited-to-iphone-15-models-on-first-ios-17-1-beta.2405140/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<title>watchOS 10.1 Beta Brings NameDrop to Apple Watch</title>

		<description><![CDATA[With the watchOS 10.1 beta that came out today, Apple Watch owners can use the new NameDrop feature to share contact information with another Apple Watch owner or with an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/apple-watch-namedrop.jpg" alt="" width="3024" height="1640" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-911345" /><br/>
Using the feature can be done by tapping into the Contacts app, selecting your profile, and then tapping on the "Share" option. From there, an animation directs you to bring the Apple Watch next to another Apple Watch or next to the top of an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; to initiate the contact information transfer.<br/>
<br/>
NameDrop was introduced in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a>, but it did not make it into the initial <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/watchos-10/">watchOS 10</a> release. Apple has instead added it in this beta to make exchanging contact information simpler. NameDrop is part of AirDrop, and it sends out your Contact Poster, name, and phone number when you use it.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/watchos-10-namedrop.jpg" alt="" width="1118" height="430" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-914235" /><br/>
NameDrop requires two iPhones running &zwnj;iOS 17&zwnj;, two Apple Watches running watchOS 10.1, or an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; running &zwnj;iOS 17&zwnj; and an Apple Watch running watchOS 10.1.<br/>
<br/>
There are also signs of the new Double Tap feature <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch/">Apple Watch Series 9</a> and Ultra 2 feature in the watchOS 10.1 code, but the function is not enabled and Double Tap remains inaccessible for now.<code><div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/watchos-10/">watchOS 10</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-programming.135">Apple Programming</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/27/watchos-10-1-beta-namedrop-apple-watch/">watchOS 10.1 Beta Brings NameDrop to Apple Watch</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/watchos-10-1-beta-brings-namedrop-to-apple-watch.2405136/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today released the first betas of iOS 17.1 and iPadOS 17.1 to developers for testing purposes, with the beta coming one day after the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/18/apple-releases-ios-17/">launch of the iOS 17 operating system</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/iOS-17.1-Feature-Purple.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-912331" /><br/>
Registered developers are able to opt into the betas by opening up the Settings app, going to the Software Update section, tapping on the "Beta Updates" option, and toggling on the ‌<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a> or <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-17/">iPadOS 17</a>‌ Developer Beta. An <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-id/">Apple ID</a> associated with a developer account is required to download and install the beta.<br/>
<br/>
We don't yet know what's included in the iOS 17.1 beta, but there are several &zwnj;iOS 17&zwnj; features that were not included in the initial release, such as the Journal app, collaborative <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/">Apple Music</a> playlists, an option to continue AirDrop transfers over the internet, the ability to use stickers as a Tapback reaction in the Messages app, an arrow for catching up on missed conversations in the Messages app, a favorite songs playlist in &zwnj;Apple Music&zwnj;, and a few other minor changes.<br/>
<br/>
Apple has said that all of these features will be coming in a future update, so we are likely to see some of these changes in the iOS 17.1 update.<br/>
<br/>
We'll update this post when we find out what's new in the beta.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-17/">iPadOS 17</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-17.241">iOS 17</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-17.242">iPadOS 17</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/27/apple-seeds-ios-17-1-beta-1/">Apple Seeds First Betas of iOS 17.1 and iPadOS 17.1 to Developers</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-seeds-first-betas-of-ios-17-1-and-ipados-17-1-to-developers.2405112/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

Registered developers can opt-in to the beta through the Software Update section of the System Settings app. Under Beta updates, simply toggle on the Sonoma Developer Beta. Note that an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-id/">Apple ID</a> associated with an Apple Developer account is required to get the beta.<br/>
<br/>
There are several features that were announced at WWDC in June but that did not make it into the launch version of &zwnj;macOS Sonoma&zwnj;. Apple says that these features are coming in an update later this year, so we could begin seeing some of them in this beta.<br/>
<br/>
Additions we are waiting on include interactive Music widgets, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/icloud/">iCloud</a> Sync improvements, the option to use Stickers through the Tapback menu in Messages, Intelligent form detection and Enhanced AutoFill for PDF documents and forms, an option to complete words by pressing the space bar, collaborative playlists in the Music app, and a favorite songs playlist.<br/>
<br/>
When we learn what's new in the beta, we'll update this article.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sonoma/">macOS Sonoma</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macos-sonoma.243">macOS Sonoma</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/27/apple-first-beta-macos-sonoma-14-1/">Apple Seeds First Beta of macOS Sonoma 14.1 to Developers</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-seeds-first-beta-of-macos-sonoma-14-1-to-developers.2405108/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today seeded the first beta of an upcoming tvOS 17.1 to developers for testing purposes, with the beta coming a week after the launch of the tvOS 17 operating system.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/10/Apple-TV-2022-Feature-Blue.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-869857" /><br/>
Registered developers are able to download the tvOS 17 update by opting in to the beta through the Settings app on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a>. A registered developer account is required.<br/>
<br/>
tvOS updates are often minor in scale compared to other operating system updates, focusing primarily on bug fixes and smaller improvements rather than notable outward-facing changes. There is no word yet on what's included in tvOS 17.1.<br/>
<br/>
Apple shares some information on tvOS releases in its <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207936">tvOS support document</a>, which is updated after each tvOS launch, but Apple does not provide notes during beta testing.<br/>
<br/>
Though we don't often know what's new in tvOS betas, we let <em>MacRumors</em> readers know when new updates are available so those who are developers can download new software upon release.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_TV">Apple TV (Neutral)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-tv-and-home-theater.100">Apple TV and Home Theater</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/27/apple-seeds-tvos-17-1-beta-1-to-developers/">Apple Seeds First Beta of tvOS 17.1 to Developers</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-seeds-first-beta-of-tvos-17-1-to-developers.2405107/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's work on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-car/">Apple Car</a> has "lost all visibility" at the current time, according to <a href="https://twitter.com/mingchikuo/status/1707091228528201754">Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo</a>. He says that if Apple does not adopt some kind of acquisition strategy to make inroads in the automotive market, it is unlikely that the &zwnj;Apple Car&zwnj; will be able to go into mass production "within the next years."<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-774147" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/12/Apple-car-wheel-icon-feature-blue.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" /><br/>
It is true that there have been few &zwnj;Apple Car&zwnj; rumors in 2023, giving us little insight into what Apple is up to at the current time. One recurring theme in &zwnj;Apple Car&zwnj; development has been reports of internal strife over the direction of the project and the ultimate goal of the &zwnj;Apple Car&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
Prior rumors suggested that Apple would begin testing on the &zwnj;Apple Car&zwnj; in 2025, with Apple aiming to provide a vehicle to consumers in 2026, but now that we are closing in on 2024, it seems unlikely that Apple will make that timeline with how little we've heard about work on the &zwnj;Apple Car&zwnj; this year.<br/>
<br/>
Apple seems to be putting a lot of focus on the Vision Pro headset at the current time, and the last &zwnj;Apple Car&zwnj; update came in March 2023. At that time, <em>Economic Daily News</em> suggested that Apple had <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/27/apple-car-self-driving-system-reportedly-advances/">made improvements to the self-driving capabilities</a> of the &zwnj;Apple Car&zwnj; and was expanding its testing, but there's been no word since then.<br/>
<br/>
Late last year, <em>Bloomberg</em>'s <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a> said that Apple had significantly <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/12/06/apple-car-project-scaled-back-delayed/">scaled back its Apple Car project</a> and no longer had plans to release a fully autonomous vehicle. Apple was aiming to design a car without a steering wheel or pedals, but decided that such a plan is not feasible. Instead, the car will allegedly have guided driving features that work on highways, but will not operate on its own at all times.<br/>
<br/>
Apple has not yet established a manufacturing partner for the &zwnj;Apple Car&zwnj;, so Kuo's suggestion that we may not see any sign of an &zwnj;Apple Car&zwnj; in the next few years without major changes makes sense. <div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-car/">Apple Car</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-inc-and-tech-industry.8">Apple, Inc and Tech Industry</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/27/apple-car-development-lost-all-visibility/">Kuo: Development of Apple Car Has &#039;Lost All Visibility&#039;</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/kuo-development-of-apple-car-has-lost-all-visibility.2405104/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple plans to release new MacBooks and iPads with 3nm chips in 2024, but demand for the devices might be "below expectations" due to a "lack of growth drivers," according to <a href="https://medium.com/@mingchikuo/asml-likely-to-cut-euv-equipment-shipment-forecasts-significantly-for-2024-by-about-20-30-31cad57b4d8">research shared today</a> by supply chain analyst Ming-Chi Kuo.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/MacBook-Air-15-Inch-Feature-Teal.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="894" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-898577" /><br/>
Kuo explained in a blog post on Medium:<blockquote>Apple's 3nm demand for 2024 would be below expectations. In 2023, Apple's MacBook and iPad shipments declined significantly by approximately 30% and 22% to 17 million and 48 million units, respectively. The sharp decline is attributed to the end of work-from-home (WFH) demand and diminishing user appeal for the new specifications (Apple Silicon and Mini-LED). Looking ahead to 2024, Apple's 3nm demand is negatively impacted by the lack of growth drivers for MacBook and iPad.</blockquote>Kuo is essentially saying that Apple will no longer have the growth catalysts that it did over the past few years, such as a pandemic-driven work-from-home boost in demand or the newness of Apple silicon, which spurred many customers to upgrade from Intel-based Macs. However, given Mac and iPad sales already significantly declined in 2023, Apple will at least have more favorable year-over-year sales comparisons in 2024.<br/>
<br/>
It's also worth noting that the next iPad Pro models are expected to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/07/07/ipad-pro-oled-display-mass-production-early-2024/">feature OLED displays</a>, which could be another growth driver for that product line.<br/>
<br/>
Kuo recently said that he <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/08/kuo-first-m3-macbooks-unlikely-2023/">does not expect Apple to release any new MacBooks</a> or <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/12/kuo-new-ipads-unlikely-to-launch-this-year/">iPads</a> between now and the end of 2023, although it was recently rumored that a new iPad mini is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/25/apple-ipad-mini-7-release-late-2023/">still possible this year</a>. If Kuo is accurate, it is possible that Apple will wait until 2024 to announce the M3 chip, which could result in a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/20/what-to-expect-from-apple-remainder-of-2023/">quiet end to this year</a> for the company.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/">Ming-Chi Kuo</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/3nm/">3nm</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/27/kuo-2024-macbooks-ipads-3nm/">Kuo: 2024 MacBooks and iPads to Feature 3nm Chips, But Demand Might Fall Below Expectations</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/kuo-2024-macbooks-and-ipads-to-feature-3nm-chips-but-demand-might-fall-below-expectations.2405084/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[On Macs running macOS Sonoma, there is currently a bug that prevents the Apple Configurator app from installing apps on iPhones and iPads, according to a new <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT213912">Apple support document</a>. Apple Configurator is commonly used by IT managers at large businesses and institutions to install apps on iPhones and iPads for employees.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/iOS-Configurator-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2250" height="1266" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-914070" /><br/>
Apple says the issue will be resolved in future updates to macOS Sonoma and Apple Configurator, but it did not provide a timeframe. In the interim, Apple recommends using a Mac with macOS Ventura or earlier installed, if possible.<br/>
<br/>
macOS Sonoma was <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/26/apple-releases-macos-sonoma/">released on Tuesday</a> following over three months of beta testing. Key new features include interactive desktop widgets, a Game Mode, the ability to add websites to the Dock as web apps, several Safari improvements, and more.

		<description><![CDATA[All four iPhone 16 models will be equipped with A18-branded chips, according to Jeff Pu, an analyst who covers companies within Apple's supply chain.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/iPhone-16-Side-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="3532" height="1986" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-913689" /><br/>
In a research note with investment firm Haitong International Securities this week, obtained by <em>MacRumors</em>, Pu said "we view A17 Pro as a transition design and now expect all the iPhone 16 models to feature A18, on TSMC's N3E."<br/>
<br/>
In response to our email, Pu clarified his expectations, as outlined below:<ul><li><strong>iPhone 16:</strong> A18 chip (N3E)</li><br/>
<li><strong>iPhone 16 Plus:</strong> A18 chip (N3E)</li><br/>
<li><strong>iPhone 16 Pro:</strong> A18 Pro chip (N3E)</li><br/>
<li><strong>iPhone 16 Pro Max:</strong> A18 Pro chip (N3E)</li></ul>Given the iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus are equipped with the A16 Bionic chip, a jump to the A18 chip for the iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus would be notable.<br/>
<br/>
N3E refers to TSMC's second-generation 3nm chip fabrication process, which is less expensive and has improved yield compared to TSMC's first-generation 3nm process, N3B, which is used for the A17 Pro chip in the iPhone 15 Pro models.<br/>
<br/>
Given that the iPhone 16 lineup is around a year away from launching, Pu is likely making an educated guess here with the marketing names, so it remains to be seen if Apple actually moves forward with A18 and A18 Pro branding. It is still possible that Apple could brand its iPhone 16 chips as the A17 and A18 Pro, mirroring recent years.<br/>
<br/>
Pu was the first source to report that Apple had <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/07/06/iphone-16-pro-solid-state-buttons-low-chance/">abandoned its plans for solid-state buttons</a> on the iPhone 15 Pro models. He also accurately revealed that the iPhone 15 Pro models would be equipped with an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/01/02/iphone-15-pro-features-specs-rumors/">increased 8GB of RAM</a>, and that the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/07/06/iphone-15-pro-max-more-expensive/">iPhone 15 Pro Max would have a higher starting price</a> than the iPhone 14 Pro Max.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a></div><div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tsmc/">TSMC</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/jeff-pu/">Jeff Pu</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/27/iphone-16-lineup-a18-a18-pro-chips-analyst-says/">iPhone 16 Lineup Will Feature A18 and A18 Pro Chips, Analyst Says</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-16-lineup-will-feature-a18-and-a18-pro-chips-analyst-says.2405036/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Former Apple design chief Jony Ive and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman have been discussing building a new AI hardware device, according to a new report by <em><a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/designer-jony-ive-and-open-ais-sam-altman-discuss-ai-hardware-project">The Information</a></em>.<br/>

Both men have spoken to SoftBank CEO and investor Masayoshi Son about the idea, according to people familiar with the conversations, but it's not clear if he will remain involved. Since leaving Apple, Ive has been concentrating on working for several clients through his British design studio, LoveFrom.<br/>
<br/>
The report is scant on details, and does not reveal anything about what such a device could be, but Ive and Altman are said to be friends and have been discussing "what new hardware for the age of AI could look like," according to one person familiar with the matter.<br/>
<br/>
Altman is one of the biggest investors in consumer hardware startup Humane, with was founded by Imran Chaudhri and Bethany Bongiorno, both former Apple employees. The startup plans to develop a screenless wearable device that can be directed using voice prompts and gestures, and projects information onto surfaces in front of it. Chaudhri in May <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMsQO5u7-NQ">demoed</a> a prototype to a TEDTalk audience. Ultimately, Humane plans to integrate OpenAI's technology into the device.<br/>

OpenAI's ChatGPT chatbot has made waves in the tech world since it was launched to the public less than a year ago. The company's annual revenue pace has exceeded &#36;1 billion, thanks to ChatGPT subscriptions and paid access to the chatbot's latest and most advanced incarnation, GPT-4. In May 2023, OpenAI released an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/18/openai-chatgpt-ios-app/">official ChatGPT app</a> for the iPhone and iPad. <br/>
<br/>
For Apple's part, the company has significantly ramped up its spending on artificial intelligence, according to a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/06/apple-conversational-ai-spending/">previous report</a> by <em>The Information</em>. Apple's "Foundational Models" team that works on conversational AI includes just 16 people, but Apple is said to be spending millions of dollars per day training its language models, which could one day be <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/15/apple-engineers-working-on-chatgpt-like-ai/">integrated into Siri</a>. <div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/jony-ive/">Jony Ive</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/chatgpt/">ChatGPT</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/27/jony-ive-openai-design-ai-hardware/">Jony Ive Could Develop AI Hardware Device With OpenAI&#039;s Sam Altman</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/jony-ive-could-develop-ai-hardware-device-with-openais-sam-altman.2405003/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>
