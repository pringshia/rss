		<description><![CDATA[Nomad today announced the launch of its latest product, the <a href="https://nomadgoods.com/products/ac-adapter-65w-usb-c-watch-edition">65W AC Power Adapter Apple Watch Edition</a>. Ideal for travel, the power adapter includes two USB-C ports and an Apple Watch charging puck.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/nomad-charger-1.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-957897" /><br/>
Like most modern chargers, Nomad's 65W Apple Watch Power Adapter uses Gallium Nitride (GaN) technology, so it's compact. It's a little thicker than Apple chargers, but it's much smaller than the comparable 61W charger from Apple and overall more portable. The prongs fold down when the charger is not in use, which increases portability.<br/>
<br/>
The two USB-C ports offer up to 65W total power, so if only one is in use, you get the full 65W. If two are in use, the top port can charge a device at 45W and the bottom port can charge a device at 20W. There is an Apple Watch charging puck at the top, and it supports fast charging for charging Apple's latest Apple Watch models at the maximum speed.<br/>
<br/>
We were able to test Nomad's new power adapter ahead of launch, and it works as expected. Pop it into an outlet and the top can charge an Apple Watch (or the AirPods) with the magnetic charging puck, while the two USB-C ports can charge a MacBook, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>, AirPods, or other device that charges over USB-C. At 65W max, you're not getting the best charging speeds for the 16-inch MacBook Pro, but it's enough for slower charging, and plenty for an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;, &zwnj;iPad&zwnj;, or smaller MacBook.<br/>
<br/>
The power adapter works best in a wall outlet where the Apple Watch charging puck is at the top of the device, but it can be used with tabletop chargers where the charging puck is at the side because of the magnetic attachment. Nomad does not include USB-C cables with the power adapter, so you'll need to supply your own.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/nomad-charger-2.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-957898" /><br/>
With some short cables, it makes for a useful travel charger. It's more compact than a lot of other travel charging options, and it can fast charge an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;, &zwnj;iPad&zwnj;, and Apple Watch, which isn't true of on-the-go <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe-battery-pack/">MagSafe</a> chargers. It's also versatile, because the two ports can charge other devices like Samsung phones and handheld game consoles.<br/>
<br/>
Nomad is known for premium devices, and the main downside to the Apple Watch Power Adapter is the price. It's &#36;100, and that's expensive for a dual-port USB-C charger that maxes out at 65W. You're getting the benefit of a built-in Apple Watch charger, a portable build, and a sleek design at that price point, but the cost is going to turn away some buyers. Still, Nomad makes reliable products and this is a high-quality power adapter that's worth checking out if you're in the market for something that's useful for travel or bringing between locations like home and work.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[The Google Maps app for iOS and Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/carplay/">CarPlay</a> now features a live speedometer, <em><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/07/09/google-maps-is-rolling-out-speedometer-speed-limits-on-iphone-and-carplay-globally/">TechCrunch</a></em> reports.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/04/Google-maps-feaure.jpg" alt="" width="2250" height="1266" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-793593" /><br/>
The feature, which was previously only available on Google Maps for Android, helps users to stay within the speed limit while driving. Now, when a user begins navigation, the vehicle's speed is shown in miles or kilometers per hour, depending on the region. The icon changes color depending on the speed indicator to subtly encourage drivers to remain within the speed limit.<br/>
<br/>
Google confirmed to <em>TechCrunch</em> that the speedometer display is now rolling out to iOS users globally, but it cautions that the feature is for "informational use only" and drivers should still rely on their vehicle's speedometer to confirm its actual speed. To turn on the speedometer and speed limits in the Google Maps app, users should navigate to their profile, Settings, Navigation, and Driving options. <div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/google-maps/">Google Maps</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/09/google-maps-for-ios-gains-speedometer/">Google Maps for iOS and Apple CarPlay Gains Live Speedometer Feature</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/google-maps-for-ios-and-apple-carplay-gains-live-speedometer-feature.2430984/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2024/07/three-new-games-come-to-apple-arcade-in-august-including-temple-run-legends/">announced</a> three new games coming to Apple Arcade next month, including award-winning roguelike game <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/vampire-survivors/id6478975337">Vampire Survivors+</a> and level-based runner <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/temple-run-legends/id1670483159">Temple Run: Legends</a> on August 1, and physics-based puzzle game <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/castle-crumble/id1616814625">Castle Crumble</a> for the Vision Pro on August 29. Apple Arcade games are ad-free and do not offer in-app purchases.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/Temple-Run-Legends.jpg" alt="" width="1960" height="1102" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-958056" /><br/>
More details can be found <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2024/07/three-new-games-come-to-apple-arcade-in-august-including-temple-run-legends/">in the Apple Newsroom press release</a>. We have pasted Apple's description of each game below.<br/>
<br/>
Vampire Survivors+ for iPhone and iPad:<blockquote>As players fight for their lives in the toxic, devil-ridden environment of Vampire Survivors+, a whole new world of horror is unleashed. From dusk to dawn, night creatures will cross their paths, forcing them to rely on the goodwill of their fellow survivors in order to prevail. While garlic, a cross, and a magic wand are useful tools to defeat their enemies, the responsibility ultimately lies in their capable hands as they test their strength against these deadly creatures from their touchscreens. This multistage game has a wide array of settings, including a multiplayer mode where up to four players can slay the undead on the same device by connecting game controllers to play together.</blockquote>Temple Run: Legends for the iPhone, iPad, Mac, and Apple TV:<blockquote>Run, swim, jump, and join a legion of heroes in Temple Run: Legends. In addition to the classic infinite run mode, players can explore ancient Aperion with fresh gameplay modes, dynamic challenges and rewards, and over 500 levels in story mode. Players should prepare to traverse exciting climates, interact with fascinating inhabitants and creatures, and encounter a unique, all-new cast of characters as they conquer their next adventure.</blockquote>Castle Crumble, expanding to the Apple Vision Pro:<blockquote>Players will embark on an adventure across a variety of kingdoms and unique biomes to take down the enemy's castles in this physics-based puzzle game. Unique controls allow players to use their hands to precision target the castles' weak points using powerful explosives, mystical spells, and mysterious unlockable boosts, and watch the castles blast apart across their living rooms. <br/>
</blockquote>Accessible through the App Store, Apple Arcade is a subscription-based service that provides access to hundreds of games across the iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple TV, and Vision Pro, all free of ads and in-app purchases. The service <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/25/apple-services-price-increases/">received its first price increase</a> last year, with U.S. pricing rising from &#36;4.99 to &#36;6.99 per month.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-arcade/">Apple Arcade</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/09/apple-arcade-games-in-august-2024/">Apple Arcade Adding These New Games in August</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-arcade-adding-these-new-games-in-august.2430981/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple last month <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2024/06/ios-18-makes-iphone-more-personal-capable-and-intelligent-than-ever/">announced</a> that the first public beta of iOS 18 would be released in July, so it should be available to try out soon.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/Generic-iOS-18-Feature-Real-Mock.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-954594" /><br/>
Below, we outline everything you need to know about the upcoming iOS 18 public beta.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Timing</h2><br/>
The first iOS 17 and iOS 16 public betas came out in the first half of July in the past two years.<br/>
<ul><li><strong>iOS 16:</strong> Monday, July 11, 2022</li><br/>
<li><strong>iOS 17:</strong> Wednesday, July 12, 2023</li></ul><br/>
<h2>How to Get Ready</h2><br/>
Enrolling in <a href="https://beta.apple.com/">Apple's free public beta testing program</a> is simple: visit <a href="https://beta.apple.com/">beta.apple.com</a>, sign in to your Apple ID account, and accept the terms and conditions. <br/>
<br/>
After signing up, open the Settings app on your iPhone and tap General → Software Update → Beta Updates. This is where the iOS 18 public beta will be listed once available, and you will be able to tap on it to begin the installation process. Note that the iPhone must be signed in to the same Apple ID enrolled in the public beta program.<br/>
<br/>
Due to software bugs and other potential issues, we recommend installing the iOS 18 public beta on a secondary iPhone, rather than the device that you use daily. We also highly recommend <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/guide/iphone/iph3ecf67d29/ios">backing up your iPhone to your Mac</a> before installing beta software on the device, to prevent data loss in the event something goes wrong.<br/>
<br/>
We will be sharing a more detailed step-by-step guide on installing the iOS 18 public beta following its release later this month.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Compatible iPhones</h2><br/>
iOS 18 is compatible with the same iPhone models as iOS 17 is:<ul><div style="float: left; width: 50%;"><li>iPhone 15</li><br/>
<li>iPhone 15 Plus </li><br/>
<li>iPhone 15 Pro </li><br/>
<li>iPhone 15 Pro Max </li><br/>
<li>iPhone 14</li><br/>
<li>iPhone 14 Plus </li><br/>
<li>iPhone 14 Pro </li><br/>
<li>iPhone 14 Pro Max </li><br/>
<li>iPhone 13 mini</li><br/>
<li>iPhone 13</li><br/>
<li>iPhone 13 Pro </li><br/>
<li>iPhone 13 Pro Max </li><br/>
</div></ul><div style="float: right; width: 50%;"><ul><li>iPhone 12 mini</li><br/>
<li>iPhone 12</li><br/>
<li>iPhone 12 Pro </li><br/>
<li>iPhone 12 Pro Max </li><br/>
<li>iPhone 11 </li><br/>
<li>iPhone 11 Pro </li><br/>
<li>iPhone 11 Pro Max </li><br/>
<li>iPhone XS </li><br/>
<li>iPhone XS Max </li><br/>
<li>iPhone XR </li><br/>
<li>iPhone SE (2nd generation or later) </li></ul> </div><div style="clear:both;"></div><br/>
<br/>
<h2>New Features</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/iOS-18-Home-Screen.jpeg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-954462" /><br/>
iOS 18 introduces new customization options for the Home Screen and Control Center, a redesigned Photos app, the ability to use any emoji as a Tapback in the Messages app, an option to lock apps behind Face ID or Touch ID, and much more.<br/>
<br/>
The tentpole feature of iOS 18 is the Apple Intelligence suite of AI features. These features will help you improve your writing, summarize your notifications, generate custom emoji and images, and much more. Apple Intelligence will also power a smarter version of Siri with on-screen awareness, deeper per-app controls, and more.<br/>
<br/>
Apple Intelligence features have yet to be added to any iOS 18 developer betas, so they might not be available in the first iOS 18 public beta.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple chipmaker TSMC will begin test production of 2nm chips next week ahead of plans to bring the technology to Apple silicon next year, <a href="https://www.etnews.com/20240709000330"><em>ET News</em></a> reports.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/04/apple-silicon-feature-joeblue.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-945652" /><br/>
The trial production run will occur at TSMC's Baoshan plant in northern Taiwan. Equipment designed for 2nm chip production was brought to the facility in the second quarter of this year. Apple is expected to move its custom silicon to the 2nm process in 2025.<br/>
<br/>
The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a> is powered by the A17 Pro chip, which is manufactured with TSMC's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/3nm/">3nm</a> process. This process allows for more transistors to be packed into a smaller space, delivering improvements in performance and efficiency. Apple's M4 chip, which recently debuted in the new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a>, uses an enhanced version of this ‌‌&zwnj;3nm&zwnj;‌‌ technology. The transition to 2nm chips should bring further improvements, with projected performance gains of 10 to 15 percent and power consumption reductions of up to 30 percent compared to the ‌‌&zwnj;3nm&zwnj;‌‌ process.<br/>
<br/>
TSMC plans to begin mass production of 2nm chips next year and it is believed that the company has been accelerating the process to secure a stable yield before mass production. TSMC remains the only company capable of manufacturing 2nm and ‌&zwnj;3nm&zwnj;‌ chips at the scale and quality Apple requires. For its ‌‌&zwnj;3nm&zwnj;‌‌ chips, Apple booked all of TSMC's available chipmaking capacity, and the chipmaker plans to triple its production capacity for the node by the end of the year to meet soaring demand. 2nm chips could first appear in 2025's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17/">iPhone 17</a> lineup.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tsmc/">TSMC</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/etnews-com/">ETNews</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-silicon/">Apple Silicon</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/2nm/">2nm</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/09/next-gen-chip-trial-to-begin-next-week/">Trial Production of Apple&#039;s Next-Gen Chip Technology to Begin Next Week</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/trial-production-of-apples-next-gen-chip-technology-to-begin-next-week.2430968/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Some owners of Philips Hue smart bulbs are reporting that their lights are randomly turning up to full brightness despite being set to dim. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/Philips_Hue_Smart_bulbs.jpeg" alt="" width="1200" height="800" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-957930" /><br/>
Philips Hue parent company <a href="https://www.philips-hue.com/en-gb/about-us">Signify</a> is reportedly aware of the issue, which is apparently related to the Matter interoperability standard, and says a fix is coming as soon as next week.<br/>
<br/>
"After extensive analysis, we have identified an interoperability issue with the Matter smarthome standard, in which random temporary radio traffic disruptions are incorrectly recognized as legacy switch power toggles, turning low brightness lights to full brightness," a spokesperson representing Signify told <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/8/24194559/philips-hue-brightness-issue-fix-matter">The Verge</a></em>. "A permanent fix for the issue is in progress and will be rolled out within the next week," they added.<br/>
<br/>
It's unclear how many Hue bulbs are going rogue and turning up to 100% brightness, but Signify says that only "a small percentage of users" have been impacted. If you're one of them and you don't fancy putting up with the random brightness changes, Signify suggests that you temporarily disconnect your Hue Bridge from your Matter smart home system until the fix arrives. <div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/philips-hue/">Philips Hue</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/09/philips-hue-bulbs-max-brightness-bug/">Philips Hue Bulbs Randomly Turning Up to Max Brightness, But a Fix Is Coming</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/philips-hue-bulbs-randomly-turning-up-to-max-brightness-but-a-fix-is-coming.2430966/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Rich Communication Services (RCS) is a messaging standard Apple is adopting in iOS 18 that will revolutionize the messaging experience between iPhone and Android devices. Think of it as SMS 2.0 – a major upgrade to the traditional text messaging we've been using for years.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/apple-rcs-thumb.jpg" alt="" width="2776" height="1562" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-923042" /><br/>
<h2>Key Features of RCS</h2><br/>
Apple's decision to embrace RCS came <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/16/apple-to-adopt-rcs-messaging-standard/">last year</a> after persistent persuasion from Google, which has been championing RCS adoption worldwide – and with good reason. Compared to MMS and SMS, the standards that Apple uses for text messages, RCS offers the following advantages:<br/>
<ul><br/>
    <li>Higher quality photos and videos</li><br/>
    <li>Larger file sizes for attachments</li><br/>
    <li>Audio messages</li><br/>
    <li>Improved group chats</li><br/>
    <li>Read receipts and typing indicators</li><br/>
    <li>Better encryption for chats between iPhone and Android users</li><br/>
    <li>Cross-platform emoji reactions</li><br/>
    <li>Location sharing within text threads</li><br/>
    <li>Works over both cellular networks and Wi-Fi</li><br/>
</ul><br/>
<h2>RCS vs. iMessage: Bridging the Gap</h2><br/>
While RCS offers many features that iPhone users have long enjoyed with iMessage, it's important to understand the differences between these two messaging protocols. The most significant advantage of RCS is its ability to work across different smartphone platforms. <br/>
<br/>
Unlike iMessage, which is exclusive to Apple devices and creates the infamous "green bubble" effect when iPhone users text Android users, RCS aims to eliminate this disparity, creating a more unified messaging experience regardless of device type. That said, RCS messages will still appear as green bubbles in Apple's Messages app, but they will be accompanied by the label "Text Message – RCS" in the conversation thread to identify them.<br/>
<br/>
In terms of features, RCS brings many of the capabilities iPhone users have come to expect from iMessage to cross-platform conversations. High-quality media sharing, read receipts, and typing indicators – all staples of the iMessage experience – will now be available when texting Android users through RCS. This marks a significant improvement in the messaging experience between different platforms.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/ios-18-beta-3-messages-rcs-toggle.jpg" alt="" width="2050" height="1153" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-957885" /><br/>
When it comes to security though, iMessage still holds the upper hand. It offers end-to-end encryption for all communications between Apple devices. RCS, while offering improved encryption compared to traditional SMS, doesn't quite reach the same level of security as iMessage. However, it's a significant step up from the unencrypted SMS messages that have been the standard for cross-platform texting.<br/>
<br/>
Another area where iMessage still maintains an edge is in its immediate availability across all Apple devices. RCS, on the other hand, depends on carrier support and implementation on both ends of the conversation. This means that while RCS promises a more unified messaging experience, its availability might not be as universal as iMessage is within the Apple ecosystem, at least initially.<br/>
<br/>
Despite these differences, the adoption of RCS by Apple represents a major step towards bridging the gap between iMessage and Android messaging. While it may not completely eliminate the distinctions, it certainly narrows them considerably, promising a richer, more consistent messaging experience for all users, regardless of their choice of smartphone. In summary, here's a breakdown of what users can expect when messaging between iPhone and Android devices:<br/>
<ul><br/>
    <li><strong>Enhanced Media Sharing</strong>: No more tiny, pixelated photos or videos when sharing media with Android friends. RCS allows for higher resolution and larger file sizes.</li><br/>
    <li><strong>Rich Messaging Features</strong>: iPhone users will be able to see when Android users are typing, know when messages are read, and use emoji reactions in cross-platform conversations.</li><br/>
    <li><strong>Better Group Chats</strong>: Group conversations including both iPhone and Android users will be more cohesive, with features like naming group chats and adding/removing participants working smoothly across platforms.</li><br/>
    <li><strong>Wi-Fi Messaging</strong>: Like iMessage, RCS can work over Wi-Fi, allowing for messaging even without cellular service.</li><br/>
    <li><strong>Seamless Fallback</strong>: If RCS isn't available for some reason, the system will automatically fall back to SMS/MMS, ensuring messages always get through.</li><br/>
</ul><br/>
<h2>When Will iPhone Users Get RCS?</h2><br/>
Apple plans to introduce RCS support with iOS 18, which is set for a general release in the fall. However, full functionality will depend on carrier support. The good news is that major U.S. carriers like Verizon, T-Mobile, and AT&T already support RCS.<br/>
<br/>
If you have the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/08/everything-new-ios-18-beta-3/">third iOS 18 beta</a> installed and you use one of the above carriers, you can try out RCS messaging support now by toggling the RCS Messaging switch in Settings ➝ Apps ➝ Messages ➝ RCS Messaging. iOS 18 beta 3 also rolls out RCS support to carriers in some other countries, such as Bell in Canada, Telefonica in Spain, and O2 in Germany.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>The Future of RCS</h2><br/>
Apple isn't stopping at just implementing RCS. The company plans to work with Google and other members of the <a href="https://www.gsma.com/solutions-and-impact/technologies/networks/gsma_resources/rich-communication-service-june-2024-publications/">Global System for Mobile Communications Association (GSMA)</a> to further improve the RCS standard worldwide. This collaboration should lead to even more advanced features, such as the ability to edit and delete sent RCS messages.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/rcs/">RCS</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/09/rcs-messaging-explained-ios-18/">RCS Messaging in iOS 18: What iPhone Users Need to Know</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/rcs-messaging-in-ios-18-what-iphone-users-need-to-know.2430965/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod/">HomePod</a> is being credited for saving a family in Colorado, alerting them to a house fire that was accidentally set by the family dog.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/01/HomePod-2-and-Mini-feature-2.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-882635" /><br/>
On June 26th, the Colorado Springs Fire Department received a call about a house fire, and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/csfdpio/videos/776680021302916/">shared the details</a> and a video on Facebook. The homeowners were alerted to the fire by their &zwnj;HomePod&zwnj;, which woke them up in the early hours of the morning.<br/>
<br/>
The Colorado Springs Fire Department claims the homeowners received a "high heat" notification from the &zwnj;HomePod&zwnj;, which alerted them to the fire, but the &zwnj;HomePod&zwnj; doesn't have a feature for sending alerts about high temperatures.<br/>
<br/>
Instead, the &zwnj;HomePod&zwnj; has Sound Recognition, an option that is able to detect the sound of a fire alarm and send an alert. It's likely that the &zwnj;HomePod&zwnj; used Sound Recognition to detect the fire, and proceeded to send an alert to the homeowners to let them know what was going on. It is unclear why the family did not hear the fire alarm that the &zwnj;HomePod&zwnj; must have detected.<br/>
<br/>
Sound Recognition on &zwnj;HomePod&zwnj; sends an alert to connected iPhones, iPads, and Apple Watches, but does not provide an audio notification. Sound Recognition can be turned on in the Home app by opening up the settings, going to Safety and Security, and toggling on Smoke and CO Alarm under Sound Recognition.<br/>
<br/>
The fire started because the family's dog accidentally turned on the stove. The homeowners had several boxes on the stovetop, and when the dog got up on its hind legs to look at them, the stove knob was turned, activating the burner. The video shows the fire starting shortly after the dog hit the knob.<br/>
<br/>
The homeowners were able to extinguish the fire before the fire department arrived, and there were no injuries aside from treatment for smoke inhalation.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/08/homepod-fire-alert/">HomePod Saves Family&#039;s Life After Dog Starts Kitchen Fire</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/homepod-saves-familys-life-after-dog-starts-kitchen-fire.2430940/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[With the third betas of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-18/">iPadOS 18</a> that Apple released today, there are additional tweaks to a number of features like <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ios-dark-mode/">Dark Mode</a> icons, the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/photos/">Photos</a> app, emoji in Messages, and more, with Apple appearing to be preparing for the launch of Apple Intelligence.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/iOS-18-on-iPhone-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-955605" /><br/>
Apple will continue updating &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj;‌ over the course of the next couple of months, refining the beta prior to its launch. We've highlighted everything new in the third ‌&zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj;‌ beta.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Dark Mode Icons</h2><br/>
There are now &zwnj;Dark Mode&zwnj; icons for many third-party apps like Facebook, Etsy, Telegram, Signal, Slack, Notion, YouTube, and more. Apple appears to be adding the &zwnj;Dark Mode&zwnj; icons automatically to apps that have icons with a handful colors.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/ios-18-dark-mode-third-party-icons.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-957880" /><br/>
With some icons, the secondary color becomes the main color, while the background color is turned to black, and in others, a white icon background transitions to black.<br/>
<br/>
Apps with complicated icon designs in many colors do not change to a &zwnj;Dark Mode&zwnj; color at this time, but Apple does tint them to be darker. When &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj; launches, app developers will be able to provide their own dark-tinted icons to be used in lieu of Apple's defaults. <br/>
<br/>
<h2>Photos App</h2><br/>
Apple added a Select button for choosing multiple images to the main &zwnj;Photos&zwnj; interface, so there is no longer a need to swipe down to get to the Select button.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/ios-18-photos-select-button.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-957881" /><br/>
With this change, the Search button is now just a magnifying glass, but it is highlighted blue to make it stand out more.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Emoji</h2><br/>
In Messages, emoji, Memoji, and stickers have all been combined into one interface, which can be navigated using the tiny icons at the bottom of the display. There are icons you can tap into to get to stickers or Memoji, and you can scroll through your Memoji to more quickly find specific characters and poses.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/ios-18-emoji-stickers-memoji.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-957882" /><br/>
You can create both stickers and Memoji from this interface, and you can use stickers right in your messages like you can use emoji. This works with non-moving stickers only, and those with animation from <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/live-photos/">Live Photos</a> will display in the larger attachment sticker size. The smaller stickers used as emoji are, however, hard to see.<br/>
<br/>
Emoji are displayed larger than before, so you see more detail but fewer characters before having to scroll, and there are more emoji and stickers displayed at once in the Recent section.<br/>
<br/>
Apple likely made these changes to prepare for the debut of Apple Intelligence, Genmoji, and Image Playground.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Wallpaper</h2><br/>
There is a dynamic version of the &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj; wallpaper that transitions through different colors based on the time of day.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/ios-18-dynamic-wallpaper-option.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-957883" /><br/>
<h2>Flashlight Interface</h2><br/>
When you activate the Flashlight, or tap on the controls from the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/dynamic-island/">Dynamic Island</a>, there is a larger and more intuitive interface for changing the brightness and the spread of the LED Flash used for the Flashlight feature.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/ios-18-flashlight-refinement.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-957884" /><br/>
<h2>Maps</h2><br/>
Apple has once again tweaked the colors of the Maps icon when &zwnj;Dark Mode&zwnj; is activated.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/ios-18-maps-dark-mode-color.jpg" alt="" width="1588" height="893" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-957886" /><br/>
<h2>RCS in Messages</h2><br/>
The interface for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/rcs/">RCS</a> in the Messages section of the Settings app has changed. Rather than just showing up as an on/off toggle, it is now a tap-in menu that provides some additional context. Apple explains that sending and receiving messages with &zwnj;RCS&zwnj; uses wireless data, and cellular network identifiers may be shared with carriers and their partners.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/ios-18-beta-3-messages-rcs-toggle.jpg" alt="" width="2050" height="1153" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-957885" /><br/>
Some <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> users in Canada and other countries are also now seeing the &zwnj;RCS&zwnj; toggle, though it is unclear if &zwnj;RCS&zwnj; is working outside of the United States. <br/>
<br/>
<h2>Apple Intelligence</h2><br/>
There are some mentions of Apple Intelligence features in the code, further hinting at the upcoming addition of AI to the &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj; beta. Code references Genmoji, Image Playground, Writing Tools, Image Wand, and more.<br/>
<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple is preparing to release a minor iOS 17.5.2 update for the iPhone, according to a post shared today by an anonymous leaker on X, formerly known as Twitter. The leaker has a private account, so we are not identifying it or linking to it, but they have proven to be a consistently accurate source for upcoming iOS updates.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/General-iOS-17-Feature-Orange-Purple.jpg" alt="" width="2250" height="1266" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-898582" /><br/>
Nothing is known about iOS 17.5.2, beyond the leaker claiming that the update will have a build number of 21F101. However, the update will almost certainly be a minor one, especially given that Apple is now focused on iOS 18 beta testing. iPhone users still running iOS 17 can expect the update to include bug fixes and/or security patches.<br/>
<br/>
It is unclear when iOS 17.5.2 will be released to the public, but updates revealed by this leaker typically become available within a few weeks after they post on social media, so it will likely be released at some point in July.<br/>
<br/>
iOS 17.5.2 will come out ahead of iOS 17.6 and iOS 18, which both remain in beta testing. The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/01/apple-seeds-ios-17-6-beta-2-to-developers/">second beta of iOS 17.6</a> was released to developers and public beta testers last week, while the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/08/apple-seeds-ios-18-beta-3/">third beta of iOS 18</a> was seeded to developers earlier today. So far, no major changes have been discovered in iOS 17.6.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-17/">iPadOS 17</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-17.241">iOS 17</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-17.242">iPadOS 17</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/08/apple-preparing-ios-17-5-2/">Apple Preparing Minor iOS 17.5.2 Update for iPhone</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-preparing-minor-ios-17-5-2-update-for-iphone.2430930/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today seeded the third betas of upcoming <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-18/">iPadOS 18</a> updates to developers for testing purposes, with the software coming two weeks after the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/24/everything-new-in-ios-18-beta-2/">release of the second betas</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/Generic-iOS-18-Feature-Real-Mock.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-954594" /><br/>
Registered developers are able to opt into the betas by opening up the Settings app, going to the Software Update section, tapping on the "Beta Updates" option, and toggling on the ‌&zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj;/&zwnj;iPadOS 18&zwnj;‌ Developer Beta setting. Note that an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-id/">Apple ID</a> associated with a developer account is required to download and install the beta.<br/>
<br/>
&zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj; introduces Apple Intelligence, a set of AI features that are built deeply into the operating system. Apple Intelligence won't be coming until later in the beta testing process, but it includes features for refining and editing writing, generating images and emoji, and most notably, improving <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a> and search. &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; is gaining a better understanding of natural language, improved contextual awareness, and the personal assistant will integrate with ChatGPT to answer more complex queries.<br/>
<br/>
Apple Intelligence features are limited to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a> models and iPads with an M-series chip, but there are a number of other features that are coming. Apple is allowing users to rearrange Home screen apps to have open spaces, plus there's a dark mode for app icons and tinting options.<br/>
<br/>
The Control Center is customizable and third-party developers can add controls for their apps, with the Lock Screen Flashlight and Camera icons able to be replaced or removed. Messages is gaining Rich Communication Services support to improve conversations with Android users, the option to schedule texts to be sent later, new text effects, messages over satellite when there's no cellular, and the option to use any emoji for Tapback responses.<br/>
<br/>
There's a dedicated Passwords app for logins, passkeys, Wi-Fi passwords, and verification codes, and there's now an option to lock and hide apps, which means they can't be opened without secondary <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mask-face-id/">Face ID</a> or <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/touch-id/">Touch ID</a> authentication even when your phone is unlocked.<br/>
<br/>
Safari has a highlights feature that summarizes articles and surfaces key information on websites, the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/photos/">Photos</a> app interface has been overhauled, and there's a new Tap to Cash feature for privately and securely transferring money using Apple Cash. Other features include equation solving and voice memo transcription in Notes, a game mode for improving game performance, and an option to respond to &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; on AirPods with head gestures.<br/>
<br/>
&zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj; is only available to registered developers at the current time, but Apple plans to make a public beta later this month. &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPadOS 18&zwnj; will see a public launch this fall.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-18/">iPadOS 18</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-18.244">iOS 18</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-18.245">iPadOS 18</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/08/apple-seeds-ios-18-beta-3/">Apple Seeds Third Betas of iOS 18 and iPadOS 18 to Developers</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-seeds-third-betas-of-ios-18-and-ipados-18-to-developers.2430918/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today released the third beta of an upcoming <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/visionos-2/">visionOS 2</a> update to developers, with the third beta coming two weeks <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/24/apple-seeds-visionos-2-beta-2-to-developers/">after the second beta</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/visionOS-2-Feature-1.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-955607" /><br/>
Registered developers are able to opt into the betas by opening up the Settings app on their device, going to the Software Update Section, tapping on the "Beta Updates" option, and toggling on the Developer Beta. Note that an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-id/">Apple ID</a> associated with a developer account is required to download and install the beta.<br/>
<br/>
&zwnj;visionOS 2&zwnj; is able to take the depth information from 2D photos and turn them into 3D photos using advanced machine learning. Apple says that the feature is meant to add depth to photos to make memories more immersive.<br/>
<br/>
There are new hand gestures for activating the Home View and Control Center, and the Home View is also now customizable with apps able to be rearranged. Travel Mode now includes support for trains, and Guest User profiles are now saved for 30 days so guests don't have to do the setup process every time they try out the headset.<br/>
<br/>
Later in the year, Mac Virtual Display will support higher resolution and larger sized virtual displays, which Apple says will be equivalent to two 4K monitors side by side. With an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airplay/">AirPlay</a> update, the Vision Pro can serve as an &zwnj;AirPlay&zwnj; receiver, so content from the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>, or Mac can be shared to the headset.<br/>
<br/>
The Mindfulness app can track and respond to breathing patterns using the camera for an improved meditation experience, and the Vision Pro supports Bluetooth mice with &zwnj;visionOS 2&zwnj;.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/visionos/">visionOS</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/visionos-2/">visionOS 2</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-vision-pro.209">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/08/apple-seeds-visionos-2-beta-3-to-developers/">Apple Seeds Third visionOS 2 Beta to Developers</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-seeds-third-visionos-2-beta-to-developers.2430921/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

To install the ‌&zwnj;watchOS 11&zwnj; update, developers need to open the Apple Watch app, go to the Software Update section under "General" in Settings, and toggle on the &zwnj;watchOS 11&zwnj; Developer Beta. An <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-id/">Apple ID</a> linked to a developer account is required.<br/>
<br/>
Once beta updates have been activated, &zwnj;watchOS 11&zwnj; can be downloaded under the same Software Update section. To install software, an Apple Watch needs to have 50 percent battery life and it must be placed on an Apple Watch charger.<br/>
<br/>
&zwnj;watchOS 11&zwnj; introduces a new Vitals app that aggregates health metrics collected during sleep like heart rate and respiratory rate, providing day-to-day health insights to track whether something has changed. There's also a Training Load feature for monitoring the intensity of workouts and how that impacts the body over time.<br/>
<br/>
The Smart Stack has been updated with new widgets and support for Live Activities and Translate, plus it is better able to suggest widgets based on time and daily routine. The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/photos/">Photos</a> watch face includes suggestions for the best images to use, and the Check In safety feature now works with Workouts.<br/>
<br/>
Activity Rings can be customized to change the goals for each day, and there is an option to pause for rest days or when ill without losing an activity streak.

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today seeded the third beta of the upcoming tvOS 18 refresh to developers for testing purposes, with the beta coming two weeks after <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/24/apple-seeds-tvos-18-beta-2-to-developers/">the second beta came out</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/apple-tv-4k-new-orange.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-953895" /><br/>
Registered developers are able to download the tvOS 18 update by opting in to the beta through the Settings app on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a>. A registered developer account is required.<br/>
<br/>
tvOS 18 adds an InSight feature to the TV app, and it is able to provide real-time information about actors, music, and more in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-tv-plus/">Apple TV+</a> shows and music. Enhanced Dialogue has been refined with machine learning and computational audio so it is better able to boost vocal clarity over background noise and music, plus it is now available on built-in TV speakers, AirPods, and other Bluetooth devices.<br/>
<br/>
Subtitles will now show up automatically when relevant, such as when the TV's volume is muted, a show or movie is rewound, or when the language of a show doesn't match the device language.<br/>
<br/>
Other new features include 21:9 aspect ratio support for projectors, new screen savers and improved controls for swapping screen savers, and support for Live Captions during <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/facetime/">FaceTime</a> calls through an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> or <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_TV">Apple TV (Don't Buy)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-tv-and-home-theater.100">Apple TV and Home Theater</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/08/apple-seeds-tvos-18-beta-3-to-developers/">Apple Seeds Third Beta of tvOS 18 to Developers</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-seeds-third-beta-of-tvos-18-to-developers.2430919/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Amazon today introduced a new all-time low price on Apple's AirPods 3, now available for <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0D1WXVQTN%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"><strong>&#36;129.89</strong></a>, down from &#36;169.00. This is the model that comes with a Lightning Charging Case, and this sale price beats the previous record low price by about &#36;10.<br/>

<br/>
AirPods 3 feature force sensor controls, Adaptive EQ, spatial audio with dynamic head tracking, and a streamlined design compared to the AirPods 2. The third-generation AirPods are a few years old at this point, with an updated model expected in just a few months, which is likely why we're starting to see big price drops online.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Starting today, select Walmart stores in the U.S. and Walmart.com will be <a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/153062/565706/9383?veh=aff&sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-MacBook-Air-13-3-inch-Laptop-Space-Gray-M1-Chip-8GB-RAM-256GB-storage%2F609040889">selling the MacBook Air with the M1 chip at a bargain &#36;649 price</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/11/macbook-air-m1-unboxing-feature.jpg" alt="" width="1616" height="902" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-770435" /><br/>
Walmart+ members have early access <a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/153062/565706/9383?veh=aff&sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-MacBook-Air-13-3-inch-Laptop-Space-Gray-M1-Chip-8GB-RAM-256GB-storage%2F609040889">to the deal</a> as of 12 p.m. Eastern Time today, and it will be available to all Walmart customers starting at 6 p.m. Eastern Time today.<br/>
<br/>
Walmart first began selling the MacBook Air with the M1 chip <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/15/walmart-selling-macbook-air-with-m1-chip/">for &#36;699 in March</a>, marking the first time the retailer ever sold Macs directly. Now, it is available for an even lower &#36;649 heading into the back-to-school shopping season. It is unclear how long the deal will last.<br/>
<br/>
Apple first released the MacBook Air with the M1 chip in November 2020, as one of the first Macs with an Apple silicon chip instead of an Intel processor. The configuration being sold for &#36;649 includes the M1 chip, 256GB of storage, and 8GB of RAM/unified memory, with Gold, Silver, and Space Gray color options available. Walmart's product listing says the MacBook Air is in brand new condition, so this is not a used/refurbished model.<br/>
<br/>
Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/04/apple-discontinues-m1-macbook-air/">discontinued the MacBook Air with the M1 chip</a> earlier this year, following the launch of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/04/apple-announces-m3-macbook-air/">new MacBook Air models with the M3 chip</a>. Prior to being discontinued, the model with the M1 chip was being sold for a starting price of &#36;999 brand new.<br/>
<br/>
While this model of the MacBook Air is now over three and a half years old, it is still a very capable machine for many average day-to-day tasks. However, it has an older design and has fewer remaining years of macOS compatibility than the latest MacBook Air models, so those aspects should be factored into your purchasing decision.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[In <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a>, Apple added several new accessibility features, and one feature in particular that is likely to have widespread appeal among car passengers is Vehicle Motion Cues, which aims to prevent motion sickness when looking at an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> or <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/vehicle-motion-cues.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-950825" /><br/>
According to Apple, research shows that motion sickness is commonly caused by a sensory conflict between what a person sees and what they feel, which can prevent some users from comfortably using ‌&zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;‌ or ‌&zwnj;iPad&zwnj;‌ while riding in a moving vehicle.<br/>
<br/>
Vehicle Motion Cues are designed to avoid this sensory conflict with the use of visual elements on the display that indicate real-time changes in motion. Apple explains: <br/>
<blockquote>With Vehicle Motion Cues, animated dots on the edges of the screen represent changes in vehicle motion to help reduce sensory conflict without interfering with the main content. Using sensors built into iPhone and iPad, Vehicle Motion Cues recognizes when a user is in a moving vehicle and responds accordingly. The feature can be set to show automatically on iPhone, or can be turned on and off in Control Center.</blockquote>As things stand in the latest &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj; beta, the Vehicle Motion Cues switch does not work in Settings ➝ Accessibility ➝ Motion, likely because of a bug that hasn't been fixed yet, but that doesn't mean you can't try it out and see if it works for you. Fortunately, the same option works in Control Center. If you're running the &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj; beta, here's how to enable it.<br/>
	<ol><li>Invoke Control Center with a diagonal swipe from the top-right corner of the screen (or with a swipe up from the bottom if your &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; has a Home button).</li><br/>
	<li>Press and hold on any space in the Control Center to enter the customize mode, then tap <strong>Add a Control</strong> at the bottom.</li><br/>
	<li>Swipe up to the "Vision Accessibility" controls, then choose <strong>Vehicle Motion Cues</strong>.<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/1vehicle-motion-cues-ios-accessibility.jpg" alt="control center" width="2898" height="2796" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-957816" /><br/>
	<li>Press and hold a space in the Control Center to exit the customize mode.</li><br/>
	<li>Tap the <strong>Vehicle Motion Cues</strong> button, then choose <strong>On</strong> or <strong>Only in Vehicle</strong>.</li></ol><br/>
If you turned on the feature, you should now see the motion cues – roving little dots – around the edges of your &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; or &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; screen. If you opted for the automatic activation, wait until you're in a moving vehicle for the cues to appear. <br/>

There's no guarantee that it will work, but with a bit of luck, the feature will allow you to look at what's on your device for the duration of your journey without you starting to feel nauseous.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-18/">iPadOS 18</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/accessibility/">Accessibility</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-18.244">iOS 18</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-18.245">iPadOS 18</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/prevent-motion-sickness-vehicle-cues-ios/">iOS 18: Prevent Motion Sickness With Vehicle Motion Cues</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-18-prevent-motion-sickness-with-vehicle-motion-cues.2430903/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today added the lower-cost Apple Pencil with a USB-C port to its online refurbished store for the first time in select European countries, including Austria, Belgium, Germany, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland, Spain, Switzerland, and the UK.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/Apple-Pencil-USB-C-sliding-cap-feature.jpg" alt="" width="1960" height="1102" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-917176" /><br/>
The refurbished model is discounted by around 15% in each country. For example, <a href="https://www.apple.com/uk/shop/product/FUWA3ZM/A/refurbished-apple-pencil-usb-c">pricing is set at £69 in the UK</a>, down from £79 brand new.<br/>
<br/>
Originally released <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/06/usb-c-apple-pencil-hands-on/">in November 2023</a>, the lower-cost Apple Pencil has a similar design as the Apple Pencil 2 and Apple Pencil Pro, but with a USB-C port hidden under a sliding cap for charging and pairing with a USB-C cable. It attaches magnetically to any iPad with a USB-C port, but it does not support wireless charging or wireless pairing. It also lacks pressure sensitivity and a double-tap gesture for switching between drawing tools.<br/>
<br/>
Apple says its refurbished products undergo full functionality testing, and are subject to a thorough cleaning process and inspection. The refurbished Apple Pencils are repackaged in a plainer white box with a refurbished label.<br/>
<br/>
Availability of the refurbished USB-C Apple Pencil will likely extend to the U.S., Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and other countries within the next few weeks.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-refurbished/">Apple Refurbished Products</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-pencil/">Apple Pencil</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipad-accessories.139">iPad Accessories</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/08/refurbished-usb-c-apple-pencil/">Apple Pencil With USB-C Now Available in Apple&#039;s Refurbished Store in These Countries</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-pencil-with-usb-c-now-available-in-apples-refurbished-store-in-these-countries.2430896/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>
