		<description><![CDATA[Now that we're in November, early Black Friday deals have begun appearing online. For AirPods, this includes a near all-time low price on the popular AirPods Pro 2, as well as record low prices on the new AirPods 4.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Following the iPad mini launch last week and a tease about Mac announcements for this week, Apple indeed made <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/30/apple-announcements-m4-imac-mac-mini-macbook-pro/">three key Mac product announcements: new iMac, Mac mini, and MacBook Pro models</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/11/top-stories-2nov2024.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-975042" /><br/>
These machines bring the M4 chip series to Apple's Mac lineup for the first time, but each in its own way offers several new features and changes that go beyond processors, so read on below for details on all of the hardware announcements plus the release of iOS 18.1 and related updates with Apple Intelligence!<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Apple Announces MacBook Pro Models With M4 Pro and M4 Max Chips, Thunderbolt 5 Support, and More</h2><br/>
Apple saved the biggest news as a wrap-up for the three-day flurry of announcements, and that's the MacBook Pro.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/10/M4-MacBook-Pro-Thumb-3.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-974142" /><br/>
The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/30/apple-announces-14-inch-macbook-pro-with-m4-chip/">entry-level 14-inch machine</a> with the M4 chip got a major upgrade bringing it closer in line with higher-spec models with features like a space black color option, a third Thunderbolt port, and more.<br/>
<br/>
The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/30/apple-announces-macbook-pro-models/">higher-end models with M4 Pro and M4 Max chip options</a> take things to the next level with Thunderbolt 5 ports and up to 40 graphics cores for maximum portable performance.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Apple Announces Redesigned Mac Mini With M4 and M4 Pro Chips, Two Front USB-C Ports, and More</h2><br/>
As expected, the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/29/apple-announces-redesigned-mac-mini/">Mac mini not only received an upgrade to M4 and M4 Pro chip options</a>, but it also got its first design overhaul since 2010 with a significantly smaller form factor.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/10/M4-mini-Thumb-2.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-973740" /><br/>
Other improvements include a pair of USB-C ports and a 3.5mm audio jack on the front for easy access, as well as three Thunderbolt ports on the rear with M4 Pro models featuring cutting-edge Thunderbolt 5.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Apple Announces iMac With M4 Chip, Center Stage Camera, Nano-Texture Display Option, and More</h2><br/>
Kicking off the week was an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/28/apple-announces-imac-with-m4-chip-upgraded-camera-new-colors-and-more/">update to the iconic iMac</a>, with the all-in-one desktop getting an upgrade to the M4 chip, a new Center Stage camera, and optional nano-texture display glass to reduce glare.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/10/Apple-iMac-M4-hero-feature.jpg" alt="" width="3840" height="2160" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-973309" /><br/>
Apple also finally <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/28/apple-announces-usb-c-magic-accessories/">updated its Magic Mouse, Magic Trackpad, and Magic Keyboard accessories</a> to feature USB-C charging ports, moving Apple tantalizingly closer to ending its use of Lightning. But in case you were wondering, yes, the Magic Mouse charging port is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/28/apple-announces-usb-c-magic-accessories/">still on the bottom</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Apple Announces MacBook Air Now Starts With Increased 16GB of RAM With No Price Increase</h2><br/>
In a bit of a surprise move, Apple this week announced that it has <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/30/macbook-air-now-starts-with-16gb-ram/">boosted the memory on all M2 and M3 MacBook Air configurations</a> at no extra charge, bumping the starting memory to 16GB on all models.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/MacBook-Air-15-Inch-Feature-Purple.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="894" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-898576" /><br/>
With that change and the rest of this week's announcements, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/30/entire-mac-lineup-now-at-least-16gb-ram/">Apple's entire Mac lineup now starts with at least 16GB of memory</a>, which will help support new and future Apple Intelligence features.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Apple Releases iOS 18.1 and iPadOS 18.1 With Apple Intelligence</h2><br/>
This week wasn't just all about hardware, as Apple also <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/28/apple-releases-ios-18-1/">released iOS 18.1</a>, macOS Sequoia 15.1 and other related updates to deliver the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/">first Apple Intelligence features</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/10/iOS-18.1-Released-Thumb-3.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-973154" /><br/>
Apple Intelligence features are currently available only in U.S. English, but they can be used in most countries as long as the device's region and language are set to the United States. Support for English localizations in several other countries is coming in December, with many other languages rolling out in 2025.<br/>
<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today <a href="https://support.apple.com/iphone-14-plus-service-program-for-rear-camera-issue">announced the launch</a> of a new repair program for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-14/">iPhone 14</a> Plus, which addresses a camera issue. According to Apple, a "very small percentage" of &zwnj;iPhone 14&zwnj; Plus devices do not show a preview of an image that is taken with the rear camera.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/10/iPhone-14-Plus-Thumb.jpg" alt="" width="3840" height="2160" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-869175" /><br/>
Affected devices were manufactured between April 10, 2023 to April 28, 2024, and Apple has a <a href="https://support.apple.com/iphone-14-plus-service-program-for-rear-camera-issue">serial number checker</a> so that users can check to see if they have an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> that might be impacted with this problem.<br/>
<br/>
&zwnj;iPhone 14&zwnj; Plus models that have the camera bug will be fixed for free by Apple. Apple says that affected users can visit an Apple retail store or an Apple Authorized Service Provider for help, with a mail-in option available as well. <br/>
<br/>
The new program covers eligible &zwnj;iPhone 14&zwnj; Plus models for three years after the first sale of the unit, and those who already paid to have the rear camera repaired can contact Apple for a refund.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/01/iphone-14-plus-camera-repair-program/">Apple Launches iPhone 14 Plus Camera Repair Program</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-launches-iphone-14-plus-camera-repair-program.2441755/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[If you've ever wanted an obscure emoji that the Unicode Consortium just hasn't gotten around to adding to the emoji lineup, Genmoji in iOS 18.2 offers a solution. In the iOS 18.2 beta right now, Genmoji lets you create custom emoji characters that can be used just like regular emoji.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/11/Genmoji-Feature-2.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-975006" /><br/>
<h2 id="creating_genmoji">Creating Genmoji</h2><br/>
To use Genmoji, open up the Messages app or another app like Notes where you see the emoji keyboard. If you don't already have access to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/image-playground/">Image Playground</a>, Genmoji, and Image Wand, you'll need to request it here and wait to be given permission. You'll get a notification when it's ready.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/11/ios-18-2-genmoji.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-974998" /><br/>
If you do have access to Genmoji, you can tap directly on the multicolored emoji face with a "+" to get into the Genmoji interface, or tap on the "Describe an Emoji" option. Either option gets you a text bar where you can start typing in a description of what you want to create, and the interface is similar to the &zwnj;Image Playground&zwnj; interface.<br/>
<br/>
As you start typing your idea, a Genmoji will automatically be generated, and you can swipe through different options to find the best representation of what you're aiming for. Unlike &zwnj;Image Playground&zwnj;, Apple does not provide suggestions like costumes and themes to add, so you're basically on your own.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/11/ios-18-2-genmoji-large.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-974999" /><br/>
If you want to change what you're seeing, you can tweak your text description until you get it right. You can generate unlimited images because it's done directly on device using the built-in A-series or M-series chip.<br/>
<br/>
Once you have the Genmoji that you want, tapping "Add" will add it to your document in Notes or the text bar in Messages. Genmoji can be sent in a large size when standalone much like an emoji, or as a small character inline with text.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/11/genmoji-inline.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-974996" /><br/>
Genmoji can be created in iOS 18.2 and iPadOS 18.2 right now, with support coming to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sequoia/">macOS Sequoia</a> at a later date.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="genmoji_with_people">Genmoji With People</h2><br/>
You can make Genmoji that look like your friends and family members using their images. To do so, you'll want to start with a description of an emoji that would include a person.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/11/genmoji-person-18-2.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-975008" /><br/>
You can type in something like "Eric sky diving with a rainbow parachute" or "doing a hula dance in Hawaii." One has a name, the other doesn't, but both are a descriptions that need a subject and don't have a specified object. When you use a Genmoji description like this, you'll see a "Person" box that you can tap into to select your subject.<br/>
<br/>
Genmoji can only use people that are saved in your People album in the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/photos/">Photos</a> app. When you select a person, the Genmoji feature uses a specific image as a base to create your emoji character.<br/>
<br/>
If you don't want to use a specific person, you can use a base emoji that you've created with a customized skin tone and hair style. That way you can make an emoji that has a generic person figure without having to use someone that you know.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/11/generic-person-genmoji-18-2.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-975015" /><br/>
There are some instances where you want a Genmoji without a person but the feature keeps insisting that you add one. If that happens, you'll need to try rephrasing.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="copying_pasting_and_sharing_genmoji">Copying, Pasting, and Sharing Genmoji</h2><br/>
You can copy and paste Genmoji across devices and in different apps, but it won't paste if the app doesn't support Genmoji. It generally works in places that support pasting images, but not in text bars.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/11/ios-18-2-share-genmoji.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-975001" /><br/>
You can paste an emoji into a text bar, so there is a difference in how an emoji works vs. how a Genmoji works for copy and paste, at least right now while Apple is still working on Genmoji.<br/>
<br/>
Genmoji can also be shared or saved to stickers by tapping on the three dots under the Genmoji after it's created.<br/>

If someone sends you a Genmoji, you can long press on it and tap on the "Emoji Details" option to see the prompt that was used to create it. From that interface, you can download it to your own device if you want to use it.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/11/genmoji-details.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-974995" /><br/>
<h2 id="how_genmoji_work">How Genmoji Work</h2><br/>
Apple started laying the groundwork for Genmoji with the initial <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-18/">iPadOS 18</a>, and &zwnj;macOS Sequoia&zwnj; launches. Emoji characters appear on Apple devices as little images, but they're actually pictographs that are encoded in the Unicode Standard and rendered by each platform.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/11/genmoji-vs-emoji.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-975007" /><br/>
Traditional emoji are added by the Unicode Consortium, and platform makers like Apple simply make the art that shows up when a device renders one of the pictographs. Because emoji work this way, Apple had to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/14/apple-explains-ios-18-genmoji/">devise a new system</a> for Genmoji.<br/>
<br/>
There is a new NSAdaptiveImageGlyph API that Apple created for Genmoji, and it also happens to allow stickers, Animoji, and Memoji to also be <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ios-18-messages/">used as emoji characters</a>, functionality that came out earlier this year. The API makes stickers, Animoji, Memoji, and Genmoji behave like emoji characters.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/11/ios-18-2-genmoji-stickers-emoji.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-975019" /><br/>
NSAdaptiveImageGlyph uses a standard image format in a square aspect ratio with support for multiple resolutions, and it is augmented with metadata. This format allows Genmoji to be used with and formatted alongside regular text, much like an emoji.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/11/ios-18-2-genmoji-vs-emoji-bees.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-975017" /><br/>
Like emoji, Genmoji can be copied, pasted, and sent as stickers. They can be used inline with text, and respect line height and formatting. Anywhere that supports rich text supports Genmoji.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/11/ios-18-2-genmoji-vs-emoji-skulls.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-975018" /><br/>
Genmoji are not supported as widely as emoji. Earlier versions of iOS, iPadOS, and macOS, as well as other software platforms and apps that do not support rich text will show Genmoji as a standard inline image or as a text description.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="where_you_can_use_genmoji">Where You Can Use Genmoji</h2><br/>
Genmoji display as proper inline emoji on devices running iOS 18.1, iPadOS 18.1, and &zwnj;macOS Sequoia&zwnj; 15.1, as well as iOS 18.2, iPadOS 18.2, and &zwnj;macOS Sequoia&zwnj; 15.2. It's clear that Apple started adding support with the .1 updates.<br/>
<br/>
If you send a Genmoji to someone running &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj;, &zwnj;iPadOS 18&zwnj;, and &zwnj;macOS Sequoia&zwnj; 15 or the .0.1 versions, they will see a square with a question mark along with an attached full-sized image. This is also what Genmoji will look like for older versions of iOS and macOS.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/11/ios-18-2-genmoji-older-device.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-975002" /><br/>
Apple might change how Genmoji appear on older devices with a software update at some point in the future, but it's a feature that's going to require the latest software for the most part.<br/>
<br/>
On Android devices, Genmoji show up as an image rather than as an emoji, so they won't behave exactly like traditional emoji. Android friends will see Genmoji as a larger, standalone picture, unless Android smartphone makers adopt some kind of support for Genmoji in the future.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/11/ios-18-2-genmoji-android.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-975000" /><br/>
<h2 id="genmoji_in_apps">Genmoji in Apps</h2><br/>
In apps like Notes, Genmoji appear as tiny emoji characters rather than as full-size images like they can in Messages. Developers have an API to add support for Genmoji, &zwnj;Image Playground&zwnj;, and Image Wand to their apps.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/11/ios-18-2-genmoji-notes-app.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-975012" /><br/>
Genmoji won't be available through the emoji keyboard in an app until support is added, but some apps can display Genmoji. The Pages app, for example, does not allow for creating emoji at the current time, but if a Genmoji is pasted into it, it shows up as a tiny emoji-like character.<br/>
<br/>
Genmoji can't be pasted into third-party apps that don't have Genmoji support. Pasting simply won't work in these situations.<br/>
<br/>
In apps where there's a small Genmoji, double tapping on it will sometimes show it in a larger size, but that's not a feature that works in all apps.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="genmoji_restrictions">Genmoji Restrictions</h2><br/>
As with &zwnj;Image Playground&zwnj;, there are some restrictions. Apple does not let you create questionable content with Genmoji, so there's no violence or nudity allowed. Apple also restricts political content and copyrighted content, so you can't create emoji with copyrighted characters, people, or products.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/11/ios-18-2-genmoji-restrictions.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-975011" /><br/>
If you try to create something that's not allowed, you'll simply see a "No Results" response, which suggests that you try describing something different.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="supported_devices">Supported Devices</h2><br/>
Genmoji will be available on devices that support <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/">Apple Intelligence</a>. That includes the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a> Pro, the &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; Pro Max, all <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a> models, all Apple silicon Macs, the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-mini/">iPad mini</a> with A17 Pro chip, and all iPads with an Apple silicon chip.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="availability">Availability</h2><br/>
Genmoji is only available in the iOS 18.2 beta, and the beta is limited to developers at the current time. There is no word yet on when a public beta might be released.<br/>
<br/>
<h3 id="waitlist">Waitlist</h3><br/>
You need to opt in to a second waitlist to get access to &zwnj;Image Playground&zwnj;, Image Wand and Genmoji in iOS 18.2, which can be done by requesting access in the Settings app, in &zwnj;Image Playground&zwnj;, or through the emoji keyboard.<br/>
<br/>
Apple says that it is rolling out access to the feature set "over the coming weeks," so some users may need to wait for a week or two to be able to use the image generation capabilities. Apple will send a notification when the features are ready to test.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="apple_intelligence_feedback">Apple Intelligence Feedback</h2><br/>
Apple is collecting feedback from developers who have access to Genmoji. Feedback can be sent by tapping the thumbs up or thumbs down icons that appear with each result, with more information able to be entered when you give a thumbs down.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/11/ios-18-2-feedback-genmoji.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-975010" /><br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple enthusiast @StellaFudge today <a href="https://x.com/StellaFudge/status/1852435351995814291">shared photos</a> of USB-C to Lightning cables in six "unreleased" colors, including what appears to be teal, blue, purple, yellow, red, and orange. He said Apple allegedly planned to include the cables with Apple silicon Macs, but the cables have never been released in these exact shades.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/11/iMac-Cables-StellaFudge.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-974992" /><em>Image Credit: @StellaFudge</em></div><br/>
"They're darker, more vibrant, and the normally white plastic has a matching color tint," he said.<br/>
<br/>
Given the cables have a Lightning connector, that means they would have been included with iMac models with the M1 chip or M3 chip, if they are authentic. The latest iMac with the M4 chip comes with a USB-C to USB-C cable for use with <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/28/apple-announces-usb-c-magic-accessories/">the new USB-C Magic accessories</a>.<br/>
<br/>
The wording of the social media post makes it sound like these cables were designed by Apple, and ultimately never released, but there is a possibility that they could be knockoff cables created by a third party. A <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/21/iphone-15-could-come-with-color-matched-cables/">similar photo of colorful USB-C cables</a> surfaced last year, but the rumor that they would be included with iPhone 15 models proved to be inaccurate. It is possible that those cables were counterfeit too, but we cannot say for sure.<br/>
<br/>
Apple has included color-matching cables with the iMac since the M1 model launched in 2021, but they have brighter, pastel colors.<br/>
<br/>
Considering that Apple never released these deeper-colored cables, at best, or they are knockoffs, at worst, their existence does not really mean too much in the end. However, it's a fun look at something that might have been.<br/>
<br/>
@StellaFudge has also shared various unreleased Apple Watch bands in the past.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[All four iPhone 17 models launching next year will be equipped with low-power LTPO displays, according to an industry source cited by <a href="https://www.etnews.com/20241025000142">South Korea's <em>ETNews</em></a> this week. While the report does not mention this, the use of LTPO technology suggests that the entire iPhone 17 lineup will feature ProMotion displays with a variable refresh rate up to 120Hz.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/10/iPhone-17-Slim-Feature-Single-Camera-1-Redux.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-974628" /><br/>
ProMotion has been limited to the Pro models since it debuted on the iPhone 13 Pro and the iPhone 13 Pro Max in 2021, so the feature's expansion to the iPhone 17 and the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/18/iphone-17-air-rumored-features/">rumored, tentatively-named "iPhone 17 Air"</a> would be notable. Samsung and LG will supply the LTPO displays for all iPhone 17 models, according to the report.<br/>
<br/>
LTPO (low-temperature polycrystalline oxide) is a low-power backplane technology for OLED displays that allows for a variable refresh rate with reduced power consumption, ensuring that ProMotion does not significantly impact battery life.<br/>
<br/>
iPhone displays with ProMotion have smoother-looking scrolling and video content. ProMotion would also allow the iPhone 17 and "iPhone 17 Air" displays to ramp down to a more power-efficient refresh rate. iPhone 13 Pro models can ramp down to 10Hz, while iPhone 14 Pro through iPhone 16 Pro models can go as low as 1Hz, allowing for an always-on display that shows various Lock Screen elements even when the device is locked. It is unclear if the iPhone 17 and the "iPhone 17 Air" would ramp down to 10Hz or 1Hz.<br/>
<br/>
Display Supply Chain Consultants CEO Ross Young previously informed <em>MacRumors</em> that the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/20/iphone-17-and-17-air-120hz-promotion-rumor/">iPhone 17 and "iPhone 17 Air" will likely support ProMotion</a>, and the feature's expansion to the entire iPhone 17 lineup has been rumored multiple times.<br/>
<br/>
The standard iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus still have 60Hz displays.<br/>
<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[After a busy October in which <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/30/apple-announcements-m4-imac-mac-mini-macbook-pro/">Apple announced new Macs</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/28/apple-releases-ios-18-1/">Apple Intelligence launched</a>, the calendar has now turned to November. Below, we outline what to expect from Apple this month as the slower-but-still-busy holiday season approaches.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/10/imac-video-apple-feature.jpg" alt="" width="2302" height="1296" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-973310" /><br/>
After seeding the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/23/apple-releases-ios-18-2/">first betas of iOS 18.2, iPadOS 18.2, and macOS Sequoia 15.2</a> with additional Apple Intelligence features last month, Apple will likely release other software betas, such as watchOS 11.2, tvOS 18.2, visionOS 2.2, and HomePod Software 18.2 in November. Public betas should begin rolling out this month too.<br/>
<br/>
tvOS 18.2 should add some of the remaining tvOS 18 features that Apple promised were coming to the Apple TV later this year, such as support for ultra-wide 21:9 projectors, screen savers for Snoopy and other Apple TV+ content, and more.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/11/Snoopy-Screen-Saver-Apple-TV.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-974878" /><em>The upcoming Snoopy screen saver for the Apple TV</em></div><br/>
visionOS 2.2 is expected to introduce an ultra-wide version of the Mac Virtual Display feature on the Vision Pro headset. Apple said this will be equivalent to two physical 4K displays sitting side by side on a desk. After this rolls out, Mac Virtual Display will be available in three sizes: Normal, Wide, and Ultrawide. The overall feature debuted as part of visionOS 1, allowing the Vision Pro to be used as an external display for a Mac. <br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/visionOS-2-Ultra-Wide-Mac-Virtual-Display.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-966668" /><em>visionOS 2.2 should add an ultrawide mode to Mac Virtual Display on Apple Vision Pro</em></div><br/>
Apple will likely expand availability of the iOS 18.2, iPadOS 18.2, and macOS Sequoia 15.2 betas to older iPhones and iPads that lack Apple Intelligence support this month too, with a later beta version. Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/28/apple-confirms-ios-18-2-december-launch/">confirmed that iOS 18.2 will be released in December</a>, and that means the other updates should be released then too.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/10/final-cut-pro-captions.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-973886" /><em>An upcoming Final Cut Pro update will add auto-captions and more</em></div><br/>
An update to Final Cut Pro that Apple teased earlier this year should be available this month. Apple said Final Cut Pro will gain support for spatial video editing on the Mac, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/29/final-cut-pro-ai-transcription-captions/">built-in caption generation for videos</a>, and more, and the update will likely arrive on Wednesday, November 13, the first day of the annual Final Cut Pro Creative Summit.<br/>
<br/>
As for hardware, the new iMac, Mac mini, and MacBook Pro models with M4 series chips will launch in stores and begin arriving to customers on Friday, November 8. And the Vision Pro launches in South Korea and the United Arab Emirates <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/30/vision-pro-coming-to-two-more-countries/">on Friday, November 15</a>, nine months after the headset launched in the United States.<br/>
<br/>
Last, the second season of hit Apple TV+ sci-fi series "Silo" begins on Friday, November 15.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CLJDR-vFUdY?si=d-sqdiNxP8Mdxsoa" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><br/>
<br/>
Of course, these are only the things that we know to expect, and Apple could have some other announcements in store this November. It's typically the month that Apple announces its extended return policy for the holiday season, announces year-end awards for services like Apple Music and the App Store, and more. Plenty to come, still!<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/01/what-to-expect-from-apple-this-november/">What to Expect From Apple This November</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/what-to-expect-from-apple-this-november.2441722/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple this week refreshed the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro/">MacBook Pro</a> with its latest Apple silicon chips, but what exactly do the latest machines bring to the table and is it worth upgrading from the previous generations?<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/10/M4-MacBook-Pros-Thumb.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-974141" /><br/>
The 14-inch &zwnj;MacBook Pro&zwnj; with the M4 chip starts at &#36;1,599, replacing the previous M3 model as the entry-level machine in Apple's pro notebook lineup. Equipped with the higher-end M4 Pro and M4 Max chips, the 14-inch &zwnj;MacBook Pro&zwnj; starts at &#36;1,999 and the 16-inch model starts at &#36;2,499.<br/>
<br/>
Upon the launch of the latest models, previous-generation &zwnj;MacBook Pro&zwnj; models have been discontinued and are no longer available from Apple's main storefront. Units of slightly older machines such as the 2023 models may, however, still be available via Apple's refurbished store and third-party retailers for significantly reduced prices. Buying a second-hand model is also an option.<br/>
<br/>
First-time &zwnj;MacBook Pro&zwnj;‌ customers or those upgrading from a much older device may be wondering whether it is worth buying a 2021 or 2023, so it will be important to weigh up exactly what was added with the latest version. Likewise, existing users of the 2021 or 2023 MacBook Pros may be wondering if it is worth upgrading to the latest model or sticking with their current device.<br/>
<br/>
See the detailed breakdown below for each new feature, change, and improvement that was added with the late 2024's ‌14- and 16-inch &zwnj;MacBook Pro&zwnj; models compared to their predecessors:<br/>

<br/>
The latest &zwnj;MacBook Pro&zwnj; models are a relatively significant update over their predecessors, offering more new features and capabilities than either of the 2023 refreshes, including Thunderbolt 5 connectivity, a 12-megapixel camera with Center Stage and Desk View, and a nano-texture display option.<br/>
<br/>
The late 2023 &zwnj;MacBook Pro&zwnj; models are relatively minor improvements over their direct predecessors that primarily focus on performance improvements. Beyond their chips, the early 2023 &zwnj;MacBook Pro&zwnj; introduced support for Wi‑Fi 6E, Bluetooth 5.3, and HDMI 2.1, and added an extra hour of battery life. The late 2023 &zwnj;MacBook Pro&zwnj; added an extra 100 nits of SDR brightness, AV1 decode, and a Space Black color option. Accumulatively, this made for quite a small upgrade for existing users of the 2021 &zwnj;MacBook Pro&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
Choosing which 14- or 16-inch &zwnj;MacBook Pro&zwnj; model to buy ultimately comes down to what level of performance you require. For example, the M4 series of chips feature a significantly more powerful Neural Engine, which may be an attractive upgrade for some users, but it is far from essential for the vast majority. Generally, unless you need peak performance for demanding professional workflows, it will not be worth upgrading from a 2023 &zwnj;MacBook Pro&zwnj; to a 2024 model, or from an early 2023 machine to a late 2023 model. Only those who need absolute peak performance with the M4 Max chip will really benefit.<br/>
<br/>
For those who have not yet made the leap to an Apple silicon machine, the 2023 &zwnj;MacBook Pro&zwnj; models are still very good options if you can get them for a significantly lower price. It is only worth paying more to get the latest model if you want a future-proof device to keep for the long term, where better performance, Thunderbolt 5, battery life, and AI capabilities are likely to be more beneficial through successive software updates and as connectivity needs with other devices evolve. Even then, it is difficult to recommend buying a late 2024 &zwnj;MacBook Pro&zwnj; at full price over an equivalent, heavily discounted 2023 model.<br/>
<br/>
The 14-inch &zwnj;MacBook Pro&zwnj; with the M4 chip effectively replaces the previous 13- and 14-inch &zwnj;MacBook Pro&zwnj;, which featured the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m1/">M1</a> chip in 2020 and the M3 chip in 2023, adding 16GB of memory as standard, longer battery life, and an additional Thunderbolt port. For users of older &zwnj;MacBook Pro&zwnj; models, the new low-cost 14-inch model represents a relatively significant upgrade. Given the improvements to Apple silicon over recent years, with redesigned GPUs, improved connectivity and external display support, and more, some &zwnj;M1 Pro&zwnj; and &zwnj;M1 Max&zwnj; &zwnj;MacBook Pro&zwnj; users may be considering an upgrade. While the &zwnj;M1&zwnj; &zwnj;MacBook Pro&zwnj; models are still highly capable machines, there are now just enough accumulative upgrades with the latest models that some users may find upgrading worthwhile.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro/">MacBook Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Pro_16">14" & 16" MacBook Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macbook-pro.90">MacBook Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/macbook-pro-upgraders-buyers-guide/">M1 vs. M2 vs. M3 vs. M4 MacBook Pro Buyer&#039;s Guide: 30+ Differences Compared</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/m1-vs-m2-vs-m3-vs-m4-macbook-pro-buyers-guide-30-differences-compared.2377515/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple has reached an agreement to acquire Pixelmator, the company behind popular photo and image editing apps Pixelmator Pro, Pixelmator for iOS, and Photomator. The acquisition is subject to regulatory approval, according to an <a href="https://www.pixelmator.com/blog/2024/11/01/a-new-home-for-pixelmator/">announcement</a> made by the Pixelmator team on Friday. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/11/pixelmator.jpg" alt="" width="1500" height="720" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-974837" /><br/>
Based in Vilnius, Lithuania, Pixelmator has developed a suite of well-regarded creative tools that compete with Adobe's offerings while maintaining a focus on ease of use and performance. The company's apps have been exclusively available on Apple's platforms, including Mac, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>.<br/>
<br/>
In their announcement, the Pixelmator team expressed enthusiasm about joining Apple, noting that they've been "inspired by Apple since day one" and have aimed to craft their products with a similar focus on design and user experience. The team believes the acquisition will help them reach a broader audience and increase their impact on creative professionals worldwide.<br/>
<br/>
For current Pixelmator users, the company stated there will be "no material changes" to their existing apps at this time, though they teased "exciting updates to come." Financial terms of the acquisition were not disclosed. The deal marks Apple's latest investment in professional creative tools, following previous acquisitions in the space such as Logic Pro and Final Cut Pro.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/pixelmator/">Pixelmator</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/01/apple-acquires-pixelmator/">Apple Acquires Photo Editing App Maker Pixelmator</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-acquires-photo-editing-app-maker-pixelmator.2441712/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[We're officially in the month of Black Friday, which will take place on Friday, November 29 in 2024. As always, this will be the best time of the year to shop for great deals, including popular Apple products like AirPods, iPad, Apple Watch, and more.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/best-early-black-friday-deals.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-920468" /><em><small>Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with some of these vendors. When you click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment, which helps us keep the site running.</small></em><br/>
<br/>
Specifically, in this article we're sharing all of the Apple products that currently have all-time low prices, or discounts that are at least very close to their record-low prices. Of course, these are early Black Friday deals, so even better discounts could emerge later in the month, but if you're shopping right now these are all the best prices around.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/jon-prosser/">Jon Prosser</a> joins us on this week's episode of <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/podcast/apples-new-m4-macs-ft-jon-prosser/id1602394741?i=1000675352820">The MacRumors Show</a> to talk through all of Apple's major Mac announcements from this week.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AbTdACA97Nk?si=pV7z-aSRDBhTTF78" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@themacrumorsshow?sub_confirmation=1">Subscribe to The MacRumors Show YouTube channel</a> for more videos</em></div><br/>
Over the first three days of the week, Apple unveiled the new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/">iMac</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-mini/">Mac mini</a>, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro/">MacBook Pro</a> with the M4, M4 Pro, and M4 Max chips. The chips offer significantly better CPU, GPU, and Neural Engine performance, improved efficiency, higher amounts of unified memory, and more. <br/>
<br/>
The new &zwnj;iMac&zwnj; features USB-C Magic accessories and a refreshed palette of color options. The new &zwnj;Mac mini&zwnj; has been completely redesigned for the first time in over a decade with a radically smaller enclosure and two front-facing USB-C ports. Finally, the new &zwnj;MacBook Pro&zwnj; has a bolstered base model, longer battery life, and a brighter display.<br/>
<br/>
The new &zwnj;iMac&zwnj; and &zwnj;MacBook Pro&zwnj; gain a nano-texture display option and a 12-megapixel front-facing camera with Center Stage and Desk View for the first time. Models with the M4 Pro or M4 Max support Thunderbolt 5 connectivity, and almost all of the new Macs feature better external display support. All of Apple's Macs now start with 16GB of unified memory as standard, including the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/">MacBook Air</a>, with no increase in price. <br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's new M4 Pro and M4 Max chips are <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/01/m4-max-chip-geekbench-benchmark-results/">impressively fast in terms of CPU performance</a>, topping the M2 Ultra, but what about graphics performance?<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/11/M3-Pro-Max-vs-M4-Pro-Max-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2250" height="1265" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-974812" /><br/>
The first Geekbench 6 results for GPU performance are now available <a href="https://browser.geekbench.com/search?k=v6_compute&q=mac16%2C11&utf8=%E2%9C%93">for the M4 Pro</a> and <a href="https://browser.geekbench.com/search?k=v6_compute&q=mac16%2C5&utf8=%E2%9C%93">M4 Max</a>, and the Metal scores reveal some impressive year-over-year gains. Based on the Metal scores that are available so far, the M4 Pro and M4 Max are <strong>up to around 40% and 25% faster</strong> for graphics than the M3 Pro and M3 Max chips, respectively.<br/>
<br/>
The new 16-inch MacBook Pro with the highest-end M4 Max with a 40-core GPU has up to 85% as fast graphics as the Mac Studio with the highest-end M2 Ultra chip with a 76-core GPU, despite having 36 fewer GPU cores, according to the results.<br/>
<br/>
Here is a comparison of the average Metal scores:<br/>
<br/>
<ul><li><strong>Mac Studio with M2 Ultra (76-core GPU):</strong> 221,646 (<a href="https://browser.geekbench.com/macs/mac-studio-2023-24c-cpu-76c-gpu">More than 600 results</a>)</li><br/>
<br/>
<li><strong>MacBook Pro with M4 Max (40-core GPU):</strong> 190,329 (2 results)</li><br/>
<br/>
<li><strong>MacBook Pro with M3 Max (40-core GPU):</strong> 154,860 (<a href="https://browser.geekbench.com/macs/macbook-pro-16-inch-nov-2023-16c-cpu-40c-gpu">More than 6,000 results</a>)</li><br/>
<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's video streaming subscription service, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a>+, launched five years ago today. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/Apple-TV-Plus-Feature-2-Green-and-Blue.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-959288" /><br/>
Announced at an Apple event in March 2019, &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj;+ was part of a major services push that included <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-news/">Apple News</a>+, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-card/">Apple Card</a>, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-arcade/">Apple Arcade</a>. At its inception, &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj;+ began with a modest library of original content, focusing on high-quality, exclusive series, films, and documentaries created in collaboration with renowned creators. The platform launched with titles like "The Morning Show," "See," "For All Mankind," and "Dickinson". Unlike many other streaming services, &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj;+ did not rely on an extensive back catalog, instead building its library from scratch with original productions.<br/>
<br/>
In the years since, &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj;+ has expanded its lineup with a wide range of content, including acclaimed series like "Ted Lasso," "Severance," and "Foundation." The service has also made strides in children's programming, documentaries, and feature films, resulting in recognition from prestigious awards organizations. &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj;+ has garnered multiple Emmy, Golden Globe, and Academy Award nominations and wins.<br/>
<br/>
Available across a wide range of devices and platforms, &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj;+ is available for &#36;9.99 per month and as part of all <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-one/">Apple One</a> subscription bundles.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-tv-plus/">Apple TV Plus</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/01/apple-tv-launched-five-years-ago-today/">Apple TV+ Launched Five Years Ago Today</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-tv-launched-five-years-ago-today.2441699/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Globalstar today <a href="https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001366868/000136686824000105/gsat-20241029.htm">announced an amended agreement with Apple</a> that will see an expansion of the satellite services that support Apple features like Emergency SOS, Roadside Assistance, Messages, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/find-my/">Find My</a> location updates that can now be handled in areas with no terrestrial Wi-Fi or cellular coverage in select countries.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/messages-via-satellite.jpg" alt="" width="2226" height="1252" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-954617" /><br/>
According to the SEC filing by Globalstar, which is Apple's existing partner in providing satellite services, Globalstar will deliver a number of improvements to Apple including a new satellite constellation, expanded ground infrastructure to support the satellites and Apple's services, and increased global licensing of the new satellite services.<br/>
<br/>
In exchange, Apple will make prepayments of up to &#36;1.1 billion to support construction and launch of the new satellites and other expenses. Apple will also take a passive 20% equity interest in Globalstar at a cost of &#36;400 million.<br/>
<br/>
Apple's satellite services debuted in late 2022 on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-14/">iPhone 14</a> models with the launch of Emergency SOS and &zwnj;Find My&zwnj; location updates via satellite in the U.S. and Canada, allowing users in remote areas to contact emergency services via text message. Over time, Apple's satellite services have expanded to additional countries and added new functions including Roadside Assistance in late 2023, and with <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a> this year, users can now communicate with others using iMessage and text messages via satellite even in non-emergency situations.<br/>
<br/>
At the time of Apple's original satellite services launch in 2022, the company said the services would be offered for free for the first two years upon the purchase of a compatible phone, with a fee required beyond that time to continue using them. Apple has, however, extended the free service period and has yet to begin charging a fee. It is unclear at this point if or when Apple will begin charging for use of satellite services, and if so, what the fee will be.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/01/apple-globalstar-satellite-agreement/">Apple Expands Globalstar Relationship to Support Growing Satellite Services</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-expands-globalstar-relationship-to-support-growing-satellite-services.2441698/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The first <a href="https://browser.geekbench.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=mac16%2C5">Geekbench 6 benchmark results for the high-end M4 Max chip</a> with a 16-core CPU surfaced today, and they show that the chip is up to 25% faster than the high-end M2 Ultra chip with a 24-core CPU in terms of peak multi-core CPU performance.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/10/M4-M4-Pro-vs-M4-Max-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-973089" /><br/>
M4 Pro chip benchmark results <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/31/m4-pro-chip-benchmark-results/">already surfaced</a> in the Geekbench 6 database on Thursday. Based on the results available so far, the M4 Max appears to be up to 20% faster than the M4 Pro in terms of peak multi-core CPU performance.<br/>
<br/>
Here is a comparison of the results (averaged):<br/>
<br/>
<ul><li><strong>MacBook Pro with M4 Max (16-core CPU):</strong> 26,675 multi-core score (highest result), 26,445 multi-core score (3 results)</li><br/>
<br/>
<li><strong>Mac mini with M4 Pro (14-core CPU):</strong> 22,094 multi-core score (11 results)</li><br/>
<br/>
<li><strong>Mac Studio with M2 Ultra (24-core CPU):</strong> 21,351 (<a href="https://browser.geekbench.com/macs/mac-studio-2023-24c-cpu-60c-gpu">More than 600 results</a>)</li></ul>M4 Max is now the fastest-ever Apple silicon chip in the Geekbench 6 database, surpassing the M2 Ultra that Apple released in the Mac Studio and Mac Pro in June 2023.<br/>
<br/>
As we mentioned in our previous reporting, you can now purchase a Mac mini with a 14-core M4 Pro for &#36;1,599 in the U.S. and get similar to faster peak performance than a Mac Studio with the 24-core M2 Ultra, a configuration that starts at &#36;3,999. And if you want up to 25% faster performance than the M2 Ultra, the 16-inch MacBook Pro with the 16-core M4 Max starts at the same &#36;3,999 price as the Mac Studio.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro/">MacBook Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/benchmarks/">Benchmarks</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/geekbench/">Geekbench</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Pro_16">14" & 16" MacBook Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macbook-pro.90">MacBook Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/01/m4-max-chip-geekbench-benchmark-results/">M4 Max Chip Up to 25% Faster Than M2 Ultra in First Benchmark Results</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/m4-max-chip-up-to-25-faster-than-m2-ultra-in-first-benchmark-results.2441693/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[WhatsApp has made it easier to organize your conversations with the global rollout of <a href="https://blog.whatsapp.com/focus-on-what-matters-with-custom-lists">custom chat lists</a>. This new feature expands on the chat filters introduced earlier this year, and offers a more personalized way to manage your messaging.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/11/whatsapp-chat-lists.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-974716" /><br/>
To create a custom list, tap the plus (+) icon in the filter bar at the top of the Chats tab. You can add both individual contacts and group chats to your lists, similar to how you might use favorites. For instance, you could create separate lists for family members, work colleagues, or neighborhood groups, allowing you to quickly find important conversations in your chats inbox.<br/>
<br/>
New lists will appear alongside existing chat filters like "All," "Unread," and "Groups" in the filter bar. If you need to make changes, simply long-press on any list name to edit its contents, which will allow you to add or removing conversations as needed. Lists are rolling out to users today, and will be available to everyone in the coming weeks, according to WhatsApp. <br/>
<br/>
WhatsApp recently also added a new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/21/whatsapp-ios-home-screen-widget/">Home Screen widget</a> for iPhone users. After updating to version 24.21.81 or later, you can add the widget to access recent chats, favorites, pinned conversations, or frequently contacted friends directly from your iPhone Home Screen.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/whatsapp/">WhatsApp</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/use-whatsapp-new-custom-chat-lists/">Find WhatsApp Conversations Faster With New Custom Chat Lists</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/find-whatsapp-conversations-faster-with-new-custom-chat-lists.2441692/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Google Maps is <a href="https://blog.google/products/maps/gemini-google-maps-navigation-updates/">rolling out</a> several new features to iOS and Android users this week, focusing on improved navigation and travel planning tools.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/11/google-maps-add-stops.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-974707" /><br/>
A new prominent "Add stops" button is being added alongside the Start button with the idea of simplifying route planning: It displays restaurants, gas stations, and points of interest along the way. This week's update also introduces weather disruption reporting, allowing drivers to mark and avoid hazards such as unplowed roads, flooding, or low visibility conditions.<br/>
<br/>
In addition, arrival assistance is getting enhanced. Google Maps will now highlight nearby parking lots and prompt users to save their parking location. The app can then provide walking directions to the final destination using AR Live View navigation.<br/>
<br/>
A more substantial navigation update is scheduled for next month, launching in over 30 metropolitan areas. This enhancement will provide clearer visualization of lanes, crosswalks, and road signs, with a blue line indicating the correct lane position during turns and merges.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/11/google-maps-weather-report-1.jpg" alt="" width="1672" height="768" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-974710" /><br/>
Looking further ahead, Google has announced plans to integrate its Gemini AI technology into Maps in the coming months. This feature will allow users to ask natural language questions about locations and receive curated recommendations based on data from over 250 million places worldwide. The AI implementation will also provide summarized reviews and detailed answers about specific venues.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/google-maps/">Google Maps</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/01/google-maps-new-weather-alerts-navigation-tools/">Google Maps Rolling Out These New Navigation Features This Week</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/google-maps-rolling-out-these-new-navigation-features-this-week.2441689/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The iPhone SE 4 that's set to come out early next year is expected to debut Apple's first in-house 5G modem, according to Jeff Pu, an analyst who covers companies within Apple's supply chain.<br/>
<br/>

In a research note this week with Hong Kong-based investment firm Haitong International Securities, Pu said Apple is expected to roll out its custom-made 5G modem starting with the next-generation iPhone SE 4. Apple's in-house modem will then be joined by a secondary Apple-made Wi-Fi 7 chip in the iPhone 17 Pro in the second half of 2025. <br/>
<br/>
Pu has <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/15/iphone-17-pro-apple-wifi-7-chip-rumor/">previously said</a> that iPhone 17 Pro models in 2025 will be equipped with an Apple-designed Wi-Fi 7 chip, which matches his latest expectations for adoption. Pu believes that both custom modem and Wi-Fi 7 chips will achieve majority adoption in iPhones by 2027.<br/>
<br/>
Pu's forecast also tallies with predictions recently made by Apple supply chain analyst Ming-Chi Kuo. On <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/31/kuo-says-apple-5g-and-wifi-chips-are-separate/">Thursday</a>, Kuo said that at least one iPhone 17 model launching next year will be equipped with an Apple-designed Wi-Fi 7 chip. Kuo also expects Apple's 5G modem to be used in the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/24/kuo-iphone-se-4-thin-iphone-17-apple-5g-chip/">rumored ultra-thin iPhone 17 model</a>.<br/>

Kuo believes that Apple's 5G and Wi-Fi chips are currently two different chips that will gradually be used in new products simultaneously starting in the second half of 2025. The early switch-over timelines will differ due to separate production schedules, according to Kuo. As Pu also suggests, the iPhone SE 4 will move to an Apple 5G modem but still use a Broadcom Wi-Fi chip.<br/>
<br/>
Apple's shift to develop its own modem and Wi-Fi chip technology would be a significant strategic move. Currently, Apple relies on Qualcomm to supply its modems, and Broadcom for its Wi-Fi and Bluetooth components. For example, all four iPhone 16 models already support Wi-Fi 7 with Broadcom's chip, but with some <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/30/m4-mac-models-no-wi-fi-7/">limited specifications</a>. By creating its own equivalents, Apple aims to reduce dependency on third-parties, gain more control over the technology, and potentially lower costs in the long run.<br/>
<br/>
The fourth-generation iPhone SE is expected to have a similar design as the base iPhone 14, with rumored features including a 6.1-inch OLED display, Face ID, a newer A-series chip, a USB-C port, a single 48-megapixel rear camera, 8GB of RAM to enable Apple Intelligence support, and of course the first-ever Apple-designed 5G modem. The new iPhone SE is expected to be released in the first half of 2025, with a launch in March or April most likely.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17/">iPhone 17</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-se/">iPhone SE</a></div><div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-5g-modem/">Apple 5G Modem</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/jeff-pu/">Jeff Pu</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/wi-fi-7/">Wi-Fi 7</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone_SE">iPhone SE (Don't Buy)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99">iPhone</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/01/iphone-se-4-5g-modem-jeff-pu/">iPhone SE 4 First to Get Apple-Designed 5G Modem, iPhone 17 Pro to Add Custom Wi-Fi 7 Chip</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-se-4-first-to-get-apple-designed-5g-modem-iphone-17-pro-to-add-custom-wi-fi-7-chip.2441686/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The first <a href="https://browser.geekbench.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=mac16">Geekbench 6 benchmark results for the M4 Pro chip</a> surfaced today. Impressively, the results that are available so far show that the highest-end M4 Pro chip is faster than the highest-end M2 Ultra chip in terms of peak multi-core CPU performance.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/10/M4-Pro-on-Blue.jpg" alt="" width="4656" height="2617" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-973987" /><br/>
Here is a comparison of the results:<br/>
<br/>
<ul><li><strong>Mac mini with M4 Pro (14-core CPU):</strong> 22,094 multi-core score (average of 11 results)</li><br/>
<br/>
<li><strong>Mac Studio with M2 Ultra (24-core CPU):</strong> 21,351 (average of <a href="https://browser.geekbench.com/macs/mac-studio-2023-24c-cpu-60c-gpu">more than 600 results</a>)</li></ul>Based on these results, the M4 Pro now holds the record of being the fastest Apple silicon chip ever in the Geekbench 6 database. Of course, it will soon be surpassed by the M4 Max chip with a 16-core CPU, but no results are available for that chip as of writing. We will publish a follow-up report with the M4 Max results once they are available.<br/>
<br/>
What this means is that you can now purchase a Mac mini with a 14-core M4 Pro for &#36;1,599 in the U.S. and get similar to faster peak performance than a Mac Studio with the 24-core M2 Ultra, a configuration that starts at &#36;3,999.<br/>
<br/>
As for year-over-year performance improvements, the M4 Pro is up to 45% faster than the highest-end M3 Pro chip in terms of multi-core CPU performance, based on the Geekbench 6 results that are available so far.<br/>
<br/>
Here is a comparison of the results:<br/>
<br/>
<ul><li><strong>Mac mini with M4 Pro (14-core CPU):</strong> 22,094 multi-core score (average of 11 results)</li><br/>
<br/>
<li><strong>14-inch MacBook Pro with M3 Pro (12-core CPU):</strong> 15,282 (average of <a href="https://browser.geekbench.com/macs/macbook-pro-14-inch-nov-2023-12c-cpu-18c-gpu">more than 4,000 results</a>)</li></ul>Read our <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/29/apple-announces-m4-pro-chip/">earlier coverage of the M4 Pro announcement</a> to learn more about the chip.<br/>
