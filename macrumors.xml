		<description><![CDATA[Ahead of the launch of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a> models, there were rumors that said both devices would see a price increase. It was speculated that the &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; could start at &#36;1,099 and the &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; Max could start at &#36;1,199, which, as it turns out, isn't quite right. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/iphone-15-pro.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-910410" /><br/>
Apple did not change the price of the &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj;, and it is still priced starting at &#36;999 for 128GB of storage. <br/>
<br/>
The &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; Max is priced starting at &#36;1,199, but that's only because Apple has eliminated the 128GB storage tier for that device. It now starts at 256GB, and &#36;1,199 is the same price Apple charged for the 256GB <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-14-pro/">iPhone 14 Pro</a> Max.<br/>
<br/>
Apple is charging &#36;1,399 for the 512GB &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; Max and &#36;1,599 for the 1TB &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; Max, so the pricing is the same as the &zwnj;iPhone 14 Pro&zwnj; Max for all storage capacities. <br/>
<br/>
The standard <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a> and &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; Plus models have not changed in price. The &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; is priced starting at &#36;799 and the &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; Plus is priced starting at &#36;899.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/september-2023-apple-event/">September 2023 Apple Event</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/12/iphone-15-pro-pricing/">Pricing on iPhone 15 Pro Models Technically Didn&#039;t Change</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/pricing-on-iphone-15-pro-models-technically-didnt-change.2401264/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[While the new standard iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus are equipped with a USB-C port, data transfer over a cable remains limited to USB 2.0 speeds of up to 480 Mbps, which is equal to the Lightning port on previous iPhones. Apple confirmed this detail in its tech specs for the devices posted on the company's website.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/iPhone-15-USB-C-Port-Event-Still.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-910412" /><br/>
The higher-end iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max are also equipped with a USB-C port, but those devices support USB 3 data transfer speeds of up to 10 Gbps over a cable. Unlike recent iPad Pro models, this means that the Pro models unfortunately do not support Thunderbolt, which theoretically supports speeds up to 40 Gbps.<br/>
<br/>
iPhone 15 Pro models will require a supported cable, such as Apple's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/12/apple-releases-usb-c-lightning-adapter-and-more/">one-meter Thunderbolt 4 Pro cable</a>, to achieve USB 3 data transfer speeds.<br/>
<br/>
All four iPhone 15 models are available to pre-order this Friday and launch September 22.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/september-2023-apple-event/">September 2023 Apple Event</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99">iPhone</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/12/iphone-15-usb-port-limited-to-lightning-speeds/">iPhone 15&#039;s USB-C Port Remains Limited to Lightning Speeds</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-15s-usb-c-port-remains-limited-to-lightning-speeds.2401261/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today announced new 6TB and 12TB storage tiers for its <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/icloud/">iCloud</a>+ subscription service, pushing past 2TB for the first time.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/icloud-plus-storage-tiers.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="898" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-910389" /><br/>
Every <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-id/">Apple ID</a> receives 5GB of free cloud storage, but users can upgrade to a paid &zwnj;iCloud&zwnj;+ storage subscription plan to get 50GB, 200GB, 2TB, 6TB, or 12TB of storage. All paid &zwnj;iCloud&zwnj;+ storage plans include features like &zwnj;iCloud&zwnj; Private Relay, Hide My Email, and Custom Email Domains. Currently, subscribers pay &#36;0.99 per month for 50GB of cloud storage, &#36;2.99 per month for 200GB, and &#36;9.99 per month for 2 TB.<br/>
<br/>
The new 6TB &zwnj;iCloud&zwnj;+ will be priced at &#36;29.99 per month and while the 12TB plan costs &#36;59.99 per month. For comparison, Google's 5TB and 10TB cloud storage plans cost &#36;24.99 and &#36;49.99 per month.<br/>
<br/>
The higher storage tiers provide an option for those who had already filled 2TB of storage from &zwnj;iCloud&zwnj;+ and 2TB of storage from an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-one/">Apple One</a> subscription. Like other &zwnj;iCloud&zwnj;+ subscription plans, the pool of cloud storage can be shared among up to six people via Family Sharing. The bigger &zwnj;iCloud&zwnj; plans are set to become available on Monday, September 18.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/icloud/">iCloud</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/icloud-drive/">iCloud Drive</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/september-2023-apple-event/">September 2023 Apple Event</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-music-apple-pay-card-icloud-fitness.134">Apple Music, Apple Pay/Card, iCloud, Fitness+</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/12/apple-adds-6tb-and-12tb-icloud-tiers/">Apple Adds 6TB and 12TB iCloud+ Storage Tiers</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-adds-6tb-and-12tb-icloud-storage-tiers.2401256/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[For the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a> and &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; Max, Apple is using a new titanium frame rather than a stainless steel frame, which cuts down on weight. The &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; Max are approximately nine percent lighter than the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-14-pro/">iPhone 14 Pro</a> and &zwnj;iPhone 14 Pro&zwnj; Max. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/f-4d62f49966d4af93a651379f09657fba6cc3c770.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="898" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-910268" /><br/>
The &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; weighs 187 grams, down from 206 grams for the &zwnj;iPhone 14 Pro&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
The &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; Max weighs 221 grams, down from 240 grams for the &zwnj;iPhone 14 Pro&zwnj; Max. <br/>
<br/>
Apple's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a> and &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; Plus continue to feature a chassis made from aluminum, so there has been no notable weight change with those devices compared to the prior-generation.<br/>
<br/>
Along with lowering the weight of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>, the titanium material is also less prone to fingerprints because of the new brushed finish and it is more durable. <div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/september-2023-apple-event/">September 2023 Apple Event</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/12/titanium-iphone-15-pro-weight/">Titanium iPhone 15 Pro Weighs 19 Grams Less Than iPhone 14 Pro</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/titanium-iphone-15-pro-weighs-19-grams-less-than-iphone-14-pro.2401254/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/12/apple-announces-iphone-15-pro/">newly announced</a> <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a> and &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; Max models introduce a new Action button that replaces the traditional Ring/Silent switch – a staple of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> since it launched in 2007. Here's a rundown of its functions.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/Apple-iPhone-15-Pro-lineup-Action-button-230912.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-910375" /><br/>
The all-new Action button replaces the single-function switch used to toggle between ring and silent, offering additional options so users can choose between quickly accessing the camera or flashlight, activate Voice Memos, Focus modes, Translate, and accessibility features like Magnifier. Users can also associate it with Shortcuts for more options. <br/>
<br/>
A press-and-hold gesture with fine-tuned haptic feedback and visual cues in the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/dynamic-island/">Dynamic Island</a> ensure the new Action button launches the intended action, which users can customize in Settings and assign to different actions. Here's what it can be programmed to do:<br/>
<ul><li><strong>Accessibility</strong>: Access to various accessibility settings, such as VoiceOver, Zoom, AssistiveTouch, and more.</li><br/>
<li><strong>Shortcuts</strong>: Run a shortcut created in or downloaded from the Shortcuts app, such as sending a message, playing a playlist, or controlling smart home devices.</li><br/>
<li><strong>Silent Mode</strong>: Like the Ring/Silent switch on existing &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; models, toggle silent mode on or off, which will mute or unmute the ringer and alerts.</li><br/>
<li><strong>Camera</strong>: Launch the Camera app and/or take a photo or video with a single press of the Action button.</li><br/>
<li><strong>Flashlight</strong>: Turn on or off the flashlight on the back of the device.<br/>
<li><strong>Focus</strong>: Activate or deactivate a Focus mode.</li><br/>
<li><strong>Magnifier</strong>: Activate the Magnifier app to use the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;'s camera as a magnifying glass to zoom in on small text or objects.</li><br/>
<li><strong>Translate</strong>: Launch the Translate app and start a conversation or text translation with a single press of the Action button.</li><br/>
<li><strong>Voice Memos</strong>: Start or stop recording a voice memo with the Voice Memos app.</li></ul><br/>
The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/12/apple-announces-iphone-15-and-15-plus/">standard iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus models</a> retain the traditional Ring/Silent switch, making the "Action" button one of the key differentiating features of the ‌&zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; Max, and also something that makes the new models‌ stand out from their predecessors.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/september-2023-apple-event/">September 2023 Apple Event</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/action-button/">Action Button</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/12/iphone-15-pro-action-button-everything-it-can-do/">iPhone 15 Pro: Here&#039;s Everything the New Action Button Can Do</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-15-pro-heres-everything-the-new-action-button-can-do.2401252/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today released a the release candidate of the Studio Display 17 firmware beta, with the update coming two weeks after the fourth beta.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-839183" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/03/apple-studio-display-blue.jpg" alt="" width="2250" height="1266" /><br/>
All Studio Display models are able to receive over-the-air firmware updates, but this firmware update is limited to Macs that are running the new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sonoma/">macOS Sonoma</a> operating system at the current time. <br/>
<br/>
Studio Display owners running &zwnj;macOS Sonoma&zwnj; can go to System Settings > Software Update to install the firmware.<br/>
<br/>
Both &zwnj;macOS Sonoma&zwnj; and the new Studio Display firmware will see a release on September 26. <div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/displays/">Apple Pro Display XDR</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/studio-display/">Apple Studio Display</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/mac-accessories.77">Mac Accessories</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/12/studio-display-17-firmware-rc/">Apple Releases Studio Display 17 Firmware Release Candidate</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-releases-studio-display-17-firmware-release-candidate.2401247/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[All of the new devices Apple today announced at its "Wonderlust" event feature no battery life improvements at all compared to their direct predecessors.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/Apple-iPhone-15-Pro-lineup-color-lineup.jpg" alt="" width="1960" height="1306" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-910342" /><br/>
This comes contrary to a multitude of rumors prior to Apple's event, which suggested that the major efficiency improvements of the S9 and A17 chips would bring battery life improvements. The approximate battery life of each of the new devices Apple unveiled today is as follows:<br/>
<br/>
<ul><br/>
<li>Apple Watch Series 9: 18 hours/36 hours in Low Power Mode</li><br/>
<li>Apple Watch Ultra 2: 36 hours/72 hours in Low Power Mode</li><br/>
<li>iPhone 15: 20 hours</li><br/>
<li>iPhone 15 Plus: 26 hours</li><br/>
<li>iPhone 15 Pro: 23 hours</li><br/>
<li>iPhone 15 Pro Max: 29 hours</li><br/>
</ul><br/>
<br/>
This is exactly the same as the Apple Watch Series 8, Apple Watch Ultra, iPhone 14, iPhone 14 Plus, iPhone 14 Pro Max, and iPhone 14 Pro Max. Of course, efficiency improvements may still result in slightly better real-world performance in Apple's latest models. <div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch/">Apple Watch Series 8</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch-ultra/">Apple Watch Ultra</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/september-2023-apple-event/">September 2023 Apple Event</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch">Apple Watch (Don't Buy)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch_Ultra">Apple Watch Ultra (Don't Buy)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-watch.172">Apple Watch</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99">iPhone</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/12/new-devices-feature-same-battery/">All of Apple&#039;s New Devices Feature the Same Battery Life as Previous Generations</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/all-of-apples-new-devices-feature-the-same-battery-life-as-previous-generations.2401237/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Following the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/12/apple-event-live-blog-september-2023/">iPhone 15 event</a> today, Apple has released a few related accessories, including a <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MUQX3AM/A/usb-c-to-lightning-adapter">USB-C to Lightning adapter</a> and a <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MU883AM/A/thunderbolt-4-usb%E2%80%91c-pro-cable-1-m">one-meter Thunderbolt 4 Pro cable</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/USB-C-Lightning-Adapter.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="901" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-910351" /><br/>
Priced at &#36;29, the USB-C to Lightning Adapter allows for Lightning accessories to be connected to the new iPhone 15, iPhone 15 Plus, iPhone 15 Pro, and iPhone 15 Pro Max models with USB-C ports for charging, data transfer, and audio connectivity. Apple says the adapter has a braided cable for added durability. It is also compatible with USB-C iPads.<br/>
<br/>
Apple's previously-existing Thunderbolt 4 Pro cable is now available in a shorter one-meter size for &#36;69. The cable has a black braided design and can be used to connect an iPhone 15 Pro model to a Mac for data transfer, with the new Pro and Pro Max models supporting USB 3.1 data transfer speeds up to 10 Gbps, according to Apple's tech specs for the devices.<br/>
<br/>
As we previously reported, Apple has also released <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/12/apple-announces-usb-c-iphone-airpods-earpods/">second-generation AirPods Pro with a USB-C charging case and EarPods with a USB-C connector</a>.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/september-2023-apple-event/">September 2023 Apple Event</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/12/apple-releases-usb-c-lightning-adapter-and-more/">Apple Releases USB-C to Lightning Adapter for iPhone 15 and 1-Meter Thunderbolt 4 Pro Cable</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-releases-usb-c-to-lightning-adapter-for-iphone-15-and-1-meter-thunderbolt-4-pro-cable.2401235/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today introduced a new firmware update for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/">AirPods Pro</a>, &zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj; 2, AirPods 2, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods/">AirPods 3</a>, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-max/">AirPods Max</a>. The new firmware is 6A301 for the &zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj; 2 and 6A300 for the first-generation &zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj;, the standard AirPods, and the &zwnj;AirPods Max&zwnj;. <br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-867348" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/09/airpods-pro-2-pink.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" /><br/>
Apple does not provide details on what features might be included in the refreshed firmware, so it is unclear what's new. There are multiple new &zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj; 2 features coming in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a>, so the &zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj; 2 update likely brings that functionality. <br/>
<br/>
Apple has been testing an &zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj; 2 firmware beta for the last few months, and it has been available to developers. &zwnj;iOS 17&zwnj; brings Adaptive Audio, which combines ANC and Transparency to deliver an ideal audio experience that blocks out loud or distracting noises.<br/>
<br/>
Adaptive Audio includes Conversation Awareness and Personalized Volume. Conversation Awareness detects when someone speaks to you, lowering the volume of what's playing and cutting down on background noise so you can hear. Personalized Volume takes into account your listening preferences and the noise in the environment to adjust sound levels.<br/>
<br/>
Other new features include an option to mute and unmute the microphone by pressing on the &zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj; stem, faster automatic switching between devices, and support for activating <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a> without including the "Hey" wake word.<br/>
<br/>
Apple does not offer instructions on how to upgrade AirPods software, but firmware is generally installed over-the-air while the ‌‌AirPods‌‌ are connected to an iOS device. Putting the ‌‌‌‌‌AirPods‌‌‌‌‌ in the case, connecting the ‌‌‌‌‌AirPods‌‌‌‌‌ to a power source, and then pairing the ‌‌‌‌‌AirPods‌‌‌‌‌ to an iOS device or Mac should force the update.<br/>
<br/>
You can check your ‌‌‌AirPods‌‌ or ‌‌‌‌‌‌&zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj;‌‌‌‌‌‌‌ firmware by following these steps:<br/>
<ul><br/>
 	<li>Connect your ‌‌‌‌‌‌&zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj;‌‌‌‌‌‌ to your iOS device.</li><br/>
 	<li>Open the Settings app.</li><br/>
 	<li>Tap General.</li><br/>
 	<li>Tap About.</li><br/>
 	<li>Tap ‌‌‌‌‌AirPods‌‌‌‌‌.</li><br/>
 	<li>Look at the number next to "Firmware Version."</li><br/>
</ul><br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today seeded the release candidate version of the upcoming macOS 14 Sonoma update to developers for testing purposes. The software update comes a week after the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/30/apple-seeds-macos-sonoma-beta-7/">launch of the seventh beta</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-900182" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/macos-sonoma-4.jpg" alt="" width="2336" height="1314" /><br/>
Registered developers can download the beta through the Apple Developer Center and after the appropriate profile is installed, with the betas available through the Software Update mechanism in System Settings.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sonoma/">macOS Sonoma</a> introduces new Apple TV-like screen savers that also serve as wallpapers after you log in, plus it moves widgets to the desktop. You can use the new widget gallery to choose from a range of widgets, and then drag them to your Mac's desktop.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/home-screen/">Widgets</a> can be arranged in any way that's useful, and when you're using an app, they are designed to fade into the background so they're less distracting. &zwnj;Widgets&zwnj; are more interactive than before, so you can use them to do things like play music, turn off the lights in your home, and more. Through Continuity, your <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>'s widgets can also show up on your Mac's desktop.<br/>
<br/>
Video conferencing has improved with a new Presenter Overlay view that shows your desktop or project in new ways, plus Safari now supports web apps for the Dock and the option to create Profiles so you can separate personal browsing from work browsing.<br/>
<br/>
Other new features include improved search that's faster and more responsive, password and passkey sharing, a revamped stickers interface for the Messages app, PDF integration in notes that makes it easier than ever to manage PDFs, and more.<br/>
<br/>
&zwnj;macOS Sonoma&zwnj; will be in beta testing for several months, with a public release coming this fall.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sonoma/">macOS Sonoma</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macos-sonoma.243">macOS Sonoma</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/12/apple-seeds-macos-sonoma-14-rc/">Apple Seeds Release Candidate Version of macOS 14 Sonoma to Developers</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-seeds-release-candidate-version-of-macos-14-sonoma-to-developers.2401224/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

The release candidates, or RCs, represent the final versions of the software that will be released to the public.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/General-iOS-17-Feature-Orange-Purple.jpg" alt="" width="2250" height="1266" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-898582" /><br/>
Registered developers are able to opt into the betas by opening up the Settings app, going to the Software Update section, tapping on the "Beta Updates" option, and toggling on the &zwnj;iOS 17&zwnj; Developer Beta. Note that an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-id/">Apple ID</a> associated with a developer account is required to download and install the beta.<br/>
<br/>
&zwnj;iOS 17&zwnj; is a major update that introduces a customized look for each person that calls, with the person who places the call able to customize their look. Live voicemails let you see a transcript of a message someone is leaving in real time so you can choose to pick up the phone if you want, and voice messages people send in iMessage are now transcribed into text. You can also record a video or audio message when someone misses your <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/facetime/">FaceTime</a> call, and &zwnj;FaceTime&zwnj; works on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a> through Continuity functionality.<br/>
<br/>
In Messages, apps have been moved to a new tucked-away interface for a cleaner look, and there is a new Check In feature that is designed to let your friends and family keep an eye on you when you're traveling. Check In automatically notifies friends or family members when you arrive at a destination, such as home. Locations can also now be shared directly from the Messages app.<br/>
<br/>
In a group chat, there's a catch-up arrow so you can see the first message you haven't seen in a conversation, and with search filters, you can more easily find what you're looking for. Stickers have been overhauled, and all emoji are now stickers, living alongside sticker packs and Memoji. Using the remove from background feature in &zwnj;iOS 17&zwnj;, you can turn the subject from any image into a sticker.<br/>
<br/>
With StandBy, an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> placed horizontally turns into a little home hub that displays information like the calendar, time, home controls, and more, and Live Activities can be displayed in full screen too.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/home-screen/">Widgets</a> on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/home-screen/">Home Screen</a> are interactive, so you can do things like check off an item on a to-do list or turn off the lights without having to open an app. AirDrop has been improved and there's a NameDrop function for sharing contacts quickly, plus you can hold two iPhones together to start a SharePlay session. SharePlay also now works with <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/carplay/">CarPlay</a> so passengers can play their music in the car too.<br/>
<br/>
Other new features include a journaling app coming later this year, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airplay/">AirPlay</a> in select hotel rooms, improvements to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/">AirPods Pro</a> 2 thanks to a new Adaptive Audio feature, offline Maps, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a> that does not require the "Hey" activation, and improvements to search and spotlight.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-17/">iPadOS 17</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-17.241">iOS 17</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-17.242">iPadOS 17</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/12/apple-releases-ios-17-rc/">Apple Seeds Release Candidate Versions of iOS 17 and iPadOS 17 to Developers</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-seeds-release-candidate-versions-of-ios-17-and-ipados-17-to-developers.2401223/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today seeded release candidate version of an upcoming <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/watchos-10/">watchOS 10</a> update to developers for testing purposes, with the software update coming over a week <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/29/apple-seeds-eighth-beta-of-watchos-10/">after the eighth beta</a>. The release candidate, or RC, represents the final version of the software that will be released to the public.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-893082" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/04/Apple-watchOS-10-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2250" height="1265" /><br/>
To install the &zwnj;watchOS 10&zwnj; update, developers will need to open the Apple Watch app, go to the Software Update section under "General" in Settings, and toggle on the &zwnj;watchOS 10&zwnj; Developer Beta. Note that an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-id/">Apple ID</a> linked to a developer account is required.<br/>
<br/>
Once beta updates have been activated, &zwnj;watchOS 10&zwnj; can be downloaded under the same Software Update section. To install software, an Apple Watch needs to have 50 percent battery life and it must be placed on an Apple Watch charger.<br/>
<br/>
&zwnj;watchOS 10&zwnj; adds a whole new widget-focused interface. You can access a widget stack from any watch face using the Digital Crown, swiping through them to get to relevant information. Control Center can be activated from any app by pressing the side button, and these new quick access controls are meant to let you use watch faces that support less information while still putting everything you need at your fingertips.<br/>
<br/>
There are new Palette and Snoopy watch faces, updates to Cycling and Hiking workouts, and mental health integrations. Users can log their state of mind and mood using the Apple Watch, with the device providing insights into mental health over time.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/watchos-10/">watchOS 10</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/watchos-9/">watchOS 9</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-programming.135">Apple Programming</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/12/apple-releases-watchos-10-rc/">Apple Seeds Release Candidate Version of watchOS 10 to Developers</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-seeds-release-candidate-version-of-watchos-10-to-developers.2401226/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today seeded the release candidate (RC) version of the upcoming tvOS 17 beta to developers for testing purposes, with the update coming a week after Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/05/apple-seeds-tvos-17-beta-9/">released the ninth beta</a>. The RC represents the final version of tvOS that will be provided to the public. <br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-870258" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/10/apple-tv-4k-yellow-bg-feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" /><br/>
Registered developers are able to download the tvOS 17 update by opting in to the beta through the Settings app on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a>. A registered developer account is required.<br/>
<br/>
tvOS updates don't typically garner as much attention as updates to iOS and macOS, and are never as feature rich, but tvOS 17 brings <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/facetime/">FaceTime</a> to the TV for the first time. The &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj; 4K can connect to an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> or <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> that serves as the camera, with the &zwnj;FaceTime&zwnj; interface showing up on the TV's screen.<br/>
<br/>
All of the &zwnj;FaceTime&zwnj; features are available, including Center Stage to keep you front and center, plus there are new gesture-based reactions that let you use your hands to generate on-screen effects. For example, if you make a heart with your hands, the screen will display hearts.<br/>
<br/>
Split View for &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj; lets users watch television with friends and family using SharePlay, and there are controls for transferring calls between the TV and an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; or &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; as needed. Third-party apps like Zoom will also be able to take advantage of this functionality, so those apps will also work on the TV screen.<br/>
<br/>
Control Center on &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj; has been revamped and it is easier for users to access key settings and information, plus there is a new feature that allows the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; to locate a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a> Remote that's been misplaced.<br/>
<br/>
tvOS also features a range of new aerial screen savers, adds support for third-party VPN apps, introduces Dolby Vision 8.1 on compatible devices, and more.

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today at its "Wonderlust" event announced that <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sonoma/">macOS Sonoma</a>, the latest version of its Mac operating system, will be available to all users with compatible Mac models starting on Tuesday, September 26.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/macos-sonoma-feature-green-brown.jpg" alt="" width="2585" height="1454" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-898567" /><br/>
<ul><li><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/11/will-my-mac-run-macos-sonoma/">Will My Mac Run macOS Sonoma?</a></li></ul><br/>
&zwnj;macOS Sonoma&zwnj; includes several new features, including interactive desktop widgets, Apple TV-like aerial screensavers, enhancements to apps like Messages and Safari, a new Game mode that prioritizes CPU and GPU performance for gaming, and more.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/macos-sonoma-widgets.jpg" alt="" width="3840" height="2160" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-900896" /><br/>
New interactive widgets can now be placed right on your desktop, blending into your desktop wallpaper to not be obtrusive when you're working, and thanks to Apple's Continuity feature you can use the same widgets from your <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> on your Mac.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/macos-sonoma-safari-profiles.jpg" alt="" width="3840" height="2160" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-900894" /><br/>
&zwnj;macOS Sonoma&zwnj; also introduces enhanced video conferencing features, including Presenter Overlay to allow a user to display themselves in front of the content they are sharing. Reactions let users share how they feel within a video session, and Screen Sharing has been improved with a simplified process.<br/>
<br/>
As is usual with macOS updates, Safari is getting numerous new features within Sonoma. There's an update to Private Browsing that provides greater protection from trackers and from people who might have access to the user's device.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/macos-sonoma-tidbits3.jpg" alt="" width="846" height="436" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-899403" /><br/>
Profiles within Safari offer a way to separate browsing between topics, like having one for work and one for personal browsing. There's also a new way to create web apps that work like normal apps and let you get to your favorite website faster.<br/>
<br/>
When you're not actively using &zwnj;macOS Sonoma&zwnj;, the new screen savers feature slow-motion videos of various locations worldwide. They shuffle between landscape, Earth, underwter, or cityscape themes, similar to what you'll see on tvOS.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/Apple-WWDC23-macOS-Sonoma-gaming-230605.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-898499" /><br/>
For gamers, there's a new Game Mode in &zwnj;macOS Sonoma&zwnj; that delivers an optimized gaming experience with smoother and more consistent frame rates. It dramatically lowers audio latency with AirPods and reduces input latency with game controllers, and it works with any game on Mac.<br/>
<br/>
Alongside &zwnj;macOS Sonoma&zwnj;, Apple at its "Wonderlust" event also <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/12/ios-17-launch-date-announced-apple/">announced the release date for iOS 17 for compatible iPhones</a>.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sonoma/">macOS Sonoma</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/september-2023-apple-event/">September 2023 Apple Event</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macos-sonoma.243">macOS Sonoma</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/12/macos-sonoma-official-release-date-announced/">macOS Sonoma to Launch on September 26, Featuring Desktop Widgets, Safari Profiles, Game Mode, and More</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/macos-sonoma-to-launch-on-september-26-featuring-desktop-widgets-safari-profiles-game-mode-and-more.2401203/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today announced that the iPhone 15 Pro Max starts at &#36;1,199 in the U.S. with 256GB of storage, which means the 128GB configuration for &#36;1,099 that was offered for the iPhone 14 Pro Max is no longer available.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/iPhone-15-Pro-Pricing.jpeg" alt="" width="1600" height="898" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-910309" /><br/>
The smaller iPhone 15 Pro continues to start at &#36;999 with 128GB of storage in the U.S., just like the iPhone 14 Pro.<br/>
<br/>
All of the new iPhone 15 models are available to order starting Friday, September 15, and will launch on Friday, September 22 in more than 40 countries and regions around the world, Apple said.<br/>

<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/General-iOS-17-Feature-Orange-Purple.jpg" alt="" width="2250" height="1266" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-898582" /><br/>
&zwnj;iOS 17&zwnj; adds a new StandBy option for the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;, allowing it to serve as an information hub when it is in a horizontal position and connected to a charger. StandBy mode displays the time, Live Activities, incoming notifications, and tons of widgets.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/StandBy-iOS-17.jpg" alt="" width="1960" height="1102" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-898860" /><br/>
Staying on the topic of widgets, widgets you use on the Lock Screen and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/home-screen/">Home Screen</a> are interactive, so you can do things like control a smart light or check off a Reminder without opening an app. Autocorrect is smarter than before, and it's easier to correct mistakes with a quick tap.<br/>
<br/>
AirDrop has a new NameDrop feature for quickly sharing contact information with a person nearby, and the Phone app has customizable Contact Posters that let you choose what people see when you call them. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/02/ios-17-namedrop.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-900409" /><br/>
Live Voicemail shows the voicemail that someone is leaving right on your Lock Screen so you can pick up if it's important, and the Messages app has a refined look and a Check-In feature that's meant to help you get to your destination safely.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/Live-Voicemail-iOS-17.jpg" alt="" width="1306" height="793" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-898863" /><br/>
<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/facetime/">FaceTime</a> supports video messages so you can leave a video voicemail if someone misses a call, plus you can use it on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a>. Safari has a locked private browsing window and a password sharing feature, and better tracking prevention. The Maps app now works offline, the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/photos/">Photos</a> app can recognize your pets, and Visual Look Up works with food, symbols, videos, and more.<br/>
<br/>

There's a new mood tracking feature available in the Health app, and later this year, Apple also plans to add a journaling app.<br/>

<br/>
&zwnj;iOS 17&zwnj;‌ is compatible with the ‌&zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;‌ XS and newer, meaning that support has been dropped for the ‌&zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;‌ 8, ‌&zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;‌ 8 Plus, and ‌&zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;‌ X. <br/>

		<description><![CDATA[With the launch of the new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a> models, Apple has discontinued the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-13/">iPhone 13</a> mini, the last remaining flagship <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> under six inches. Apple only made two 5.4-inch &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; minis, the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-12/">iPhone 12 mini</a> and the &zwnj;iPhone 13&zwnj; mini.<br/>

The &zwnj;iPhone 12 mini&zwnj; was discontinued with the launch of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-14/">iPhone 14</a>, leaving the &zwnj;iPhone 13&zwnj; mini as the only smaller flagship option. The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-se/">iPhone SE</a> is still available to those who want something smaller than 6.1 inches, but it does not have modern features like <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mask-face-id/">Face ID</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Apple is continuing to sell the &zwnj;iPhone 13&zwnj; and the &zwnj;iPhone 14&zwnj; as lower-cost options that are offered as an alternative to the &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj;. The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-12/">iPhone 12</a> has also been discontinued and replaced with the &zwnj;iPhone 13&zwnj;, which has dropped in price. Apple's full device lineup is as follows:<br/>
<ul><br/>
 	<li><strong>iPhone SE</strong> - &#36;429</li><br/>
 	<li><strong>iPhone 13</strong> - &#36;599</li><br/>
 	<li><strong>iPhone 14</strong> - &#36;699</li><br/>
 	<li><strong>iPhone 15</strong> - &#36;799</li><br/>
 	<li><strong>iPhone 15 Plus</strong> - &#36;899</li><br/>
 	<li><strong>iPhone 15 Pro</strong> - &#36;999</li><br/>
 	<li><strong>iPhone 15 Pro Max</strong> - &#36;1199</li><br/>
</ul><br/>
While the &zwnj;iPhone 13&zwnj; mini and the &zwnj;iPhone 12&zwnj; have been discontinued by Apple, they may still be <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/refurbished/iphone">available from the refurbished store</a> while supplies last, and third-party retailers will also have some stock available until it sells out.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-13/">iPhone 13</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/september-2023-apple-event/">September 2023 Apple Event</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99">iPhone</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/12/apple-discontinues-iphone-13-mini/">Apple Discontinues 5.4-Inch iPhone 13 Mini, Still Sells iPhone 13 and iPhone 14</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-discontinues-5-4-inch-iphone-13-mini-still-sells-iphone-13-and-iphone-14.2401191/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>
