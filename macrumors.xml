Mark is known for his accurate insider knowledge about Apple's plans and he is behind many of the major reports covered here on <em>MacRumors</em>. Earlier today, he published a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-09-08/apple-event-2023-iphone-15-pro-max-airpods-watch-series-9-products-to-expect">detailed report</a> outlining his expectations for Apple's "Wonderlust" event, revealing a range of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/08/last-minute-iphone-15-report-reveals-new-details/">new details</a> about the devices Apple is expected to unveil.<br/>

<br/>
Mark also shares a few tidbits related to Apple's other product plans including an updated <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/">iPad Air</a> in the works, new USB-C accessories, and more.<br/>
<br/>

The sale officially begins Monday, September 11, but Samsung is providing early access to a select few products right now.<br/>
<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's highest-end iPhone this year will be named iPhone 15 Pro Max, instead of iPhone 15 Ultra, according to a report on Friday from <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-09-08/apple-event-2023-iphone-15-pro-max-airpods-watch-series-9-products-to-expect"><em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman</a>. The other devices in the lineup will include the iPhone 15, iPhone 15 Plus, and iPhone 15 Pro.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/02/iPhone-Ultra-in-Hand-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2250" height="1265" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-886425" /><br/>
Gurman himself previously reported that Apple has <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/09/25/iphone-15-ultra-replacing-pro-max-model/">considered Ultra branding</a> for its highest-end iPhone, similar to the Apple Watch Ultra, and it is possible it will be used for the iPhone 16 Ultra with a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/08/iphone-16-pro-larger-display-sizes/">larger 6.9-inch display</a> next year. For now, however, it appears that Pro Max branding will live on for at least another year.<br/>
<br/>
The iPhone 15 Pro Max is rumored to exclusively feature an upgraded telephoto lens with <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/18/iphone-15-pro-max-5-6x-optical-zoom/">up to 6x optical zoom</a>, compared to a 3x limit on the iPhone 14 Pro models. The device is also expected to feature a titanium frame, customizable Action button, faster A17 Bionic chip, thinner bezels, Wi-Fi 6E support, and more. iPhone 15 Pro Max pricing is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/07/iphone-15-pro-will-still-start-at-999-trendforce/">rumored to start at &#36;1,199</a> in the U.S., which would be &#36;100 more than the iPhone 14 Pro Max.<br/>
<br/>
Apple is set to unveil the iPhone 15 series at its "Wonderlust" event <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/29/apple-september-12-event-announcement/">on Tuesday, September 12</a> at 10 a.m. Pacific Time.

The Notes app supports inline PDFs, which means you can insert a PDF into Notes and then read, annotate, and collaborate on PDFs.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/ipados-17-pdfs-in-notes.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-900348" /><br/>
This functionality also works for scanned documents, and it is available on both the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> and the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<h3 id="updated_formatting">Updated Formatting</h3><br/>
Notes has gained an option for creating block quotes, plus there's a new Monostyled format to choose.<br/>
<br/>
<h3 id="pages">Pages</h3><br/>
A Note from the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; or &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; can be opened up in the Pages app, providing additional layout and formatting options.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="reminders">Reminders</h2><br/>
<h3 id="grocery_sorting">Grocery Sorting</h3><br/>
When you create a list with the new "Groceries" list type, you can input various foods and sundries and have them organized automatically by category. The organization makes it easier to find what you need when you're at the grocery store.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/ios-17-reminders-app.jpg" alt="" width="5459" height="3071" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-899272" /><br/>
Available category types include Produce, Breads &amp; Cereals, Frozen Foods, Snacks &amp; Candy, Meat, Dairy, Eggs &amp; Cheese, Bakery, Baking Items, Household Items, Personal Care &amp; Health, and Wine, Beer &amp; Spirits.<br/>
<br/>
If the ‌&zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;‌ doesn't recognize where an item should go, it remains uncategorized. It does recognize specific brands and types of food like "Sour Patch Kids," so it is a fairly robust solution for grocery shopping. You can also create your own categories in the grocery list.<br/>
<br/>
<h3 id="custom_sections">Custom Sections</h3><br/>
Sections or categories are turned on by default for the Grocery list, but any Reminder list created in &zwnj;iOS 17&zwnj; can have sections added to it.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/reminders-sections.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-909626" /><br/>
In any list, tap on the three dots to get to the options interface. From there, tap on New Section to add a section to the list. You'll need to manually organize items in the list in each section, but it can be done with simple drag and drop gestures.<br/>
<br/>
<h3 id="column_view">Column View</h3><br/>
In the same options interface, there's a new "View as Columns" option that will show each section in a side-by-side view. You can swap between column and list view in the options menu.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/reminders-ios-17-column-view.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-909625" /><br/>
<h3 id="interactive_widgets">Interactive Widgets</h3><br/>
&zwnj;iOS 17&zwnj; brings interactive widgets to the Lock Screen and the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/home-screen/">Home Screen</a>, and Reminders is one of the built-in apps that can best take advantage of this feature. Reminders in the Reminders widget can be checked off right from the &zwnj;Home Screen&zwnj; or the Lock Screen without having to open up the Reminders app.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/reminders-widget.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-909624" /><br/>
<h3 id="early_reminders">Early Reminders</h3><br/>
If you add a reminder with a specific date, you can opt to receive an early reminder to get a warning ahead of time. You can get a notification 1 day before, 2 days before, 1 week before, 2 weeks before, 1 month before, 3 months before, and 6 months before, plus there's also an option to set a custom early reminder time.<br/>
<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[For this week's giveaway, we've teamed up with <a href="https://gridstudio.cc/">GRID Studio</a> to offer <em>MacRumors</em> readers a chance to win a 512GB <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a>. GRID Studio is known for its Apple-themed works of art that are made from old, discarded Apple electronics that are disassembled so each individual component can be displayed.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/grid-studio-grid-1.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-902133" /><br/>
Each GRID piece is organized around the chassis of the device, with parts labeled and explanations provided so it's clear what's what. GRID Studio also includes interesting and relevant historical facts for added context.<br/>
<br/>
There are a range different GRID Studio frames that feature iPhones, iPads, and iPods, with prices that start at &#36;40 and go up based on the complexity of the piece.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="https://gridstudio.cc/products/iphone-1st-generation">GRID 1</a>, one of GRID Studio's most popular options, showcases the first <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> that Apple ever made. Priced at &#36;400, it features all of the components that Apple used for the original &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; back in 2007. The ‌&zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;‌'s shell is positioned next to the power button, headphone socket, speaker, logic board, ear piece, and other components. GRID does not include the original batteries from the device, but replicas are added so the battery is not missing.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/grid-iPhone2G.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-909376" /><br/>
The <a href="https://gridstudio.cc/products/grid%C2%AE4s">GRID 4s</a> is another iconic device that's available at a special price to celebrate GRID Studio's 3rd anniversary. Right now, it's just &#36;99, down from the original &#36;170 price tag. The Grid 4s has around 40 components from the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 4s, all of which are neatly arranged and labeled.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/grid-iPhone4s.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-909377" /><br/>
This year is the 10th anniversary of the colorful &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 5c, so GRID Studio has created the <a href="https://gridstudio.cc/products/grid%C2%AE-iphone-5c">&#36;139 GRID iPhone 5C</a> using the bright blue &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 5C from 2013. With its polycarbonate shell, rounded corners, and unique colors, the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 5C stands out from all other iPhones Apple has designed, and it was only sold for a short period before it was replaced.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/grid-iPhone5C.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-909378" /><br/>
For those looking for something unique, the &#36;400 <a href="https://gridstudio.cc/products/u2-ipod">GRID iPod U2</a> features the coveted black and red iPod from 2004. It came preloaded with U2 content, and it is appealing to iPod fans and U2 fans alike. The GRID iPod U2 features the iconic click wheel, the black chassis of the iPod, and quotes from both Bono and Steve Jobs.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/grid-ipod-u2.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-909379" /><br/>
Along with deconstructed device art, GRID Studio has also recently gotten into t-shirts, and the &#36;40 rainbow-colored <a href="https://gridstudio.cc/products/hellotshirt">GRID Hello T-Shirt</a> is sure to be a favorite of any Apple fan. The classic hello script is created using tons of different device icons in various colors, so it is both colorful and visually interesting.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/grid-hello-t-shirt.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-909380" /><br/>
From September 8 to September 10, GRID Studio is having a &#36;99 sale <a href="https://gridstudio.cc/products/grid%C2%AE4s">on the GRID 4s</a> for its anniversary, plus there's a 15 percent discount available on all other products with promo code T15.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple is unlikely to release any new MacBook models with the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m3/">M3 chip</a> this year, according to <a href="https://twitter.com/mingchikuo/status/1700193866178343036">information shared today</a> by supply chain analyst Ming-Chi Kuo.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/MacBook-Air-15-Inch-Feature-Purple.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="894" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-898576" /><br/>
"It seems that Apple will not launch new MacBook models (equipped with M3 series processors) before the end of this year," Kuo wrote on X, formerly known as Twitter.<br/>
<br/>
Earlier this year, <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman said an Apple event in October of this year <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/07/17/apple-m3-macs-october-event/">could feature the first Macs with the M3 chip</a>. He said Macs that were candidates for the M3 chip included the 13-inch MacBook Air, 13-inch MacBook Pro, and 24-inch iMac. Kuo only ruled out new MacBooks, so there is still potential for a new iMac this year.<br/>
<br/>
The as-yet-unannounced M3 chip is widely expected to be fabricated with TSMC's 3nm process for significant performance and power efficiency improvements compared to the current 5nm-based M2 chip, which debuted in June 2022.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro-13/">MacBook Pro 13"</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/">MacBook Air</a></div><div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/">Ming-Chi Kuo</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m3/">M3</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Pro_13">13" MacBook Pro (Don't Buy)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Air">13" MacBook Air (Don't Buy)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macbook-pro.90">MacBook Pro</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macbook-air.122">MacBook Air</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/08/kuo-first-m3-macbooks-unlikely-2023/">Kuo: First MacBooks With M3 Chip Unlikely to Launch This Year</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/kuo-first-macbooks-with-m3-chip-unlikely-to-launch-this-year.2400834/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This week's best deals include steep discounts on 15-inch MacBook Air, 13.6-inch MacBook Air, Mac mini, and AirPods Pro 2. We're also tracking a sale offering new Disney+ subscribers the chance to get the ad-based version of the service for just &#36;1.99/month for three months.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/06/Hero0009.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-847999" /><em><small>Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with some of these vendors.

<br/>
Disney+ is offering new subscribers a chance to save on the Basic Plan (with ads), discounting the service to &#36;1.99 per month for three months. After three months, the service will renew for &#36;7.99 per month unless you cancel. This offer will last through September 20. <br/>
<br/>
Disney is planning a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/09/disney-hulu-price-increase-october/">significant price increase</a> to its service next month, so anyone interested might want to lock in an annual subscription at the cheaper price before that happens.<br/>
<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[The widely-rumored titanium frame on Apple's upcoming iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max will make the devices about 10% lighter than the iPhone 14 Pro models, according to a report today <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-09-08/apple-event-2023-iphone-15-pro-max-airpods-watch-series-9-products-to-expect">from <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/iPhone-XS-Max-Black-Background.jpeg" alt="" width="1500" height="844" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-909569" /><br/>
The iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max weigh 206 grams and 240 grams, respectively, according to Apple's tech specs for the devices. An approximate 10% weight reduction would result in the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max weighing around 185 grams and 216 grams, respectively. This would make the iPhone 15 Pro the lightest Pro model since the iPhone XS, which weighs 177 grams. Likewise, the iPhone 15 Pro Max would be the lightest Max model since the iPhone XS Max, which weighed 208 grams.<br/>
<br/>
Given that Gurman said the weight reduction will be "about" 10%, the exact figures remain to be seen. If the iPhone 15 Pro ends up being 188 grams or heavier, it would instead be the most lightweight Pro model since the iPhone 11 Pro. In any case, it appears that the upcoming Pro models will be the lightest in several generations of devices.<br/>
<br/>
Pro model weights:<ul><li><strong>iPhone X:</strong> 174 grams</li><br/>
<li><strong>iPhone XS:</strong> 177 grams</li><br/>
<li><strong>iPhone 11 Pro:</strong> 188 grams</li><br/>
<li><strong>iPhone 12 Pro:</strong> 189 grams</li><br/>
<li><strong>iPhone 13 Pro:</strong> 203 grams</li><br/>
<li><strong>iPhone 14 Pro:</strong> 206 grams</li><br/>
<li><strong>iPhone 15 Pro:</strong> ~185 grams?</li></ul>Pro Max model weights:<ul><li><strong>iPhone XS Max:</strong> 208 grams</li><br/>
<li><strong>iPhone 11 Pro Max:</strong> 226 grams</li><br/>

All tablets in this sale are in new condition and come with a one year Apple warranty.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/05/ipad-pro-m1-feature.jpg" alt="" width="1780" height="1001" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-800056" /><em><small>Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with Woot. When you click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment, which helps us keep the site running.</small></em><br/>
<br/>
Starting with the 11-inch iPad Pro, Woot is offering these tablets with the Apple Smart Folio in select colors. Prices start at &#36;659.99 (22 percent off) for 128GB Wi-Fi and rise to &#36;849.99 (50 percent off) for 2TB Wi-Fi.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://www.dpbolvw.net/click-462641-13142085?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcomputers.woot.com%2Foffers%2Fnew-apple-2021-11-ipad-pro-with-case-3%3Fref%3Dw_cnt_wp_0_3"target="_blank"><div class="fancybutton"><div class="fancybadge">UP TO 50% OFF</div>11-Inch M1 iPad Pro at Woot</div></a></div><br/>
<br/>
Woot also has multiple 12.9-inch iPad Pro models, and these do not come with the Apple Smart Folio. Prices start at &#36;859.99 (22 percent off) for 128GB Wi-Fi and rise to &#36;949.99 (27 percent off) for 512GB Wi-Fi. As of writing, Woot does not have any 1TB or 2TB versions of the 12.9-inch Wi-Fi iPad Pro in stock.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-462641-13142085?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcomputers.woot.com%2Foffers%2Fnew-apple-2021-12-9-ipad-pro-3%3Fref%3Dw_cnt_wp_0_1"target="_blank"><div class="fancybutton"><div class="fancybadge">UP TO 27% OFF</div>12.9-Inch M1 iPad Pro at Woot</div></a></div><br/>
<br/>
In addition to Wi-Fi models, Woot also has the <a href="https://www.tkqlhce.com/click-462641-13142085?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcomputers.woot.com%2Fplus%2F2021-apple-ipad-pro-your-choice-1%3Fref%3Dw_cnt_gw_dly_snb">cellular versions</a> of the 11-inch and 12.9-inch M1 iPad Pro tablets on sale. Woot's sale will last through September 18, although it could end earlier if select tablets sell out, so be sure to browse soon if you're interested.<br/>
<br/>
We haven't tracked discounts on the M1 iPad Pro at other retailers in about a year, given that recent sales have shifted to focus on the M2 models that launched in 2022. These tablets are fairly similar to one another, with the biggest advantages in the 2022 model being the M2 chip's internal upgrades and Apple Pencil hover.

		<description><![CDATA[Apple plans to bring a USB-C port to the standard AirPods and the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-max/">AirPods Max</a> as soon as 2024, according to <em>Bloomberg</em>'s <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/12/airpods-max-flat.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-775235" /><br/>
In a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-09-08/apple-event-2023-iphone-15-pro-max-airpods-watch-series-9-products-to-expect">new article</a> outlining his <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/08/last-minute-iphone-15-report-reveals-new-details/">specific expectations</a> for Apple's "Wonderlust" event, featuring <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/08/series-9-and-ultra-2-to-feature-sensors-and-more/">new details</a> about the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-watch-series-9/">Apple Watch Series 9</a>, second-generation <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch-ultra/">Apple Watch Ultra</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a>, &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; Plus, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a>, and &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; Max, Gurman mentioned that the company is apparently working to move all of its Lightning-based accessories to USB-C. <br/>
<br/>
USB-C will come to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/">AirPods Pro</a> first, with the switch being introduced during Apple's event next week where it is expected to be a key feature of the &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj;, followed by the other AirPods models as soon as next year. The new &zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj; set to be introduced next week will not offer "any other major new hardware features," Gurman said.<br/>
<br/>
In the long term, Gurman reinforced that Apple is working on bringing health features to its AirPods, including body-temperature sensing and a hearing-test system. These improvements are likely to arrive at some point after the switch to USB-C across the lineup.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods/">AirPods 3</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-max/">AirPods Max</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/">AirPods Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/bloomberg-com/">Bloomberg</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/usb-c/">USB-C</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AirPods">AirPods (Caution)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AirPods-Max">AirPods Max (Neutral)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AirPods-Pro">AirPods Pro (Neutral)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/airpods.216">AirPods</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/08/usb-c-airpods-and-airpods-max-2024/">USB-C Reportedly Coming to AirPods and AirPods Max as Soon as 2024</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/usb-c-reportedly-coming-to-airpods-and-airpods-max-as-soon-as-2024.2400805/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-watch-series-9/">Apple Watch Series 9</a> and second-generation <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch-ultra/">Apple Watch Ultra</a> will offer several previously undisclosed features, <em>Bloomberg</em>'s <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a> claims.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/08/Apple-Watch-Series-9-Pink-Aluminum-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-905452" /><br/>
In a detailed <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-09-08/apple-event-2023-iphone-15-pro-max-airpods-watch-series-9-products-to-expect">report</a> outlining his full expectations for Apple's "Wonderlust" event, Gurman said that the &zwnj;Apple Watch Series 9&zwnj; and second-generation &zwnj;Apple Watch Ultra&zwnj; will offer various sensor and component upgrades, with a general "focus on speed, efficiency, and accuracy." These changes will include a new version of Apple's optical heart rate sensor. The Apple Watch Series 7 and Series 8 feature Apple's third-generation optical heart rate sensor.<br/>
<br/>
The new Apple Watches will also feature an all-new "U2" ultra wideband chip, the first generational iteration of the component since the U1 chip's 2019 introduction in the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> 11 Pro. The new chip will improve the Apple Watch's location capabilities, allowing people and devices to be tracked more precisely in the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/find-my-network-accessory-program/">Find My</a> App. It is apparently set to come to all of the next versions of Apple's major products, including the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a>.<br/>
<br/>
The second-generation &zwnj;Apple Watch Ultra&zwnj; will be manufactured with more recycled materials, as well as come in a black color option for the first time. As <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/30/apple-3d-printing-device-components/">previously reported</a>, the stainless steel &zwnj;Apple Watch Series 9&zwnj; will feature a 3D-printed casing. Apple plans to start manufacturing the &zwnj;Apple Watch Ultra&zwnj; with the technology starting next year. <br/>
<br/>
This year's main Apple Watch upgrade will be a new processor, which has to date effectively not been changed throughout three successive generations of the device. Apple apparently plans to "heavily tout major gains in processing speed" during its "Wonderlust" event.<br/>
<br/>
The new Apple Watch models will otherwise be largely unchanged compared to their predecessors. The company also plans to shift away from some of its leather watch bands, and there are signs that Apple may finally update or discontinue the Link Bracelet introduced alongside the original Apple Watch.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch/">Apple Watch Series 8</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch-ultra/">Apple Watch Ultra</a></div><div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/bloomberg-com/">Bloomberg</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch">Apple Watch (Don't Buy)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch_Ultra">Apple Watch Ultra (Don't Buy)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-watch.172">Apple Watch</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/08/series-9-and-ultra-2-to-feature-sensors-and-more/">Gurman: Apple Watch Series 9 and Ultra 2 to Feature New Heart Rate Monitor, More Accurate Sensors, U2 Chip, and More</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/gurman-apple-watch-series-9-and-ultra-2-to-feature-new-heart-rate-monitor-more-accurate-sensors-u2-chip-and-more.2400803/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[<em>Bloomberg</em>'s <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a> today shared his <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-09-08/apple-event-2023-iphone-15-pro-max-airpods-watch-series-9-products-to-expect">expectations</a> for Apple's "Wonderlust" event, revealing several significant new features for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a> models. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/iPhone-15-Blue-Three-Quarters-Perspective-Camera-Closeup-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-909012" /><br/>
Gurman claims that the new titanium chassis of the &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; models will be more durable, reduce weight by around 10 percent, and have a brushed effect, unlike the polished finish of the current devices that have stainless steel frames, to reduce fingerprints. The edges where the metal sides and glass front and back of the device meet are now more smooth and rounded. He added that the displays of both Pro models will look perceptibly larger due to their reduced bezels, which are about one-third smaller. <br/>
<br/>
While the A17 Bionic will offer improved performance thanks to its first-of-its-kind <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/3nm/">3nm</a> fabrication process, one of the main benefits of the chip will apparently be enhanced battery life. The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-14-pro/">iPhone 14 Pro</a> and &zwnj;iPhone 14 Pro&zwnj; Max currently have a battery life of around 23- and 29-hours, respectively. The next-generation devices will also feature more memory, increasing from the 6GB of memory that have been offered in Pro <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> models in recent years.<br/>
<br/>
The new "Action Button" that replaces the mute switch have customizable functionality to perform tasks including "silencing the phone, turning on a Focus mode, opening the flashlight, launching the camera, starting a voice recording, opening <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a> shortcuts, pulling up the digital magnifying glass and opening accessibility settings."<br/>
<br/>
In addition, the &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; Max's telephoto and ultra wide cameras will feature more megapixels than their predecessors, increasing beyond 12-megapixels for the first time. Gurman also clarified that the &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; Max will retain its "Pro Max" moniker, and will not be branded as an "Ultra" model as some previous rumors have suggested.<br/>
<br/>
Both the standard and the Pro &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; models will feature an all-new "U2" ultra wideband chip, the first iteration of the component since the U1 chip's introduction in the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 11 Pro in 2019. The new chip will improve location capabilities, allowing people and devices to be tracked more precisely in the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/find-my-network-accessory-program/">Find My</a> App. It is apparently set to come to all of the next versions of Apple's major products. Another improvement coming to the entire &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; lineup is faster wireless charging speeds and a more repairable design.<br/>
<br/>
Gurman also reiterated several previously reported rumors, such as the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/dynamic-island/">Dynamic Island</a>, A16 Bionic chip, and 48-megapixel main camera coming to the &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; Plus, as well as the &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; Max's periscope telephoto camera with up to 6x optical zoom.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/bloomberg-com/">Bloomberg</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99">iPhone</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/08/last-minute-iphone-15-report-reveals-new-details/">Last-Minute iPhone 15 Report Reveals New Battery Life, Design, and Camera Details</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/last-minute-iphone-15-report-reveals-new-battery-life-design-and-camera-details.2400802/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[With Apple's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a> series launch potentially now <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/07/when-will-iphone-15-be-released/">just two weeks away</a>, Apple retail employees are <a href="https://m.blog.naver.com/PostView.naver?blogId=yeux1122&logNo=223204211450&navType=by">reportedly</a> being drilled to emphasize to customers at the point of sale that the switch to USB-C means the new devices cannot be charged with existing Lightning charging cables that they may already own. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/05/iPhone-15-to-Switch-From-Lightning-to-USB-C-in-2023-feature.jpg" alt="" width="2621" height="1475" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-845312" /><br/>
When customers purchase a new &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; model, Apple staff will be trained to caution that while a USB-C to USB-C cable is included in the box, a USB-C charger is not. Employees will therefore direct customers to the in-store availability of Apple USB-C power adapters and additional Apple-certified USB-C cables to meet the need for multiple charging locations.<br/>
<br/>
Apple has used its proprietary Lightning port on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> models for over 10 years, but in recent years Apple's Macs and iPads have all transitioned to the more common USB-C charging standard. Pressure to comply with new regulations implemented in Europe reportedly <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/18/apple-iphone-15-lightning-test/">hastened the company's decision to switch to USB-C for iPhones</a>, however despite its initial reluctance to make the change in 2023, Apple stands to profit enormously from the switch.<br/>
<br/>
According to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/21/kuo-iphone-usb-c-faster-charging-speeds/">Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo</a>, Apple in March significantly increased the total shipment forecast of its 20W USB-C charger by approximately 120% for the third quarter of this year, and set 20W USB-C charger shipments at about 70 million units for the fourth quarter. Overall, Apple's 20W USB-C charger shipments in 2023 are anticipated to see a significant 30–40% year-on-year growth, amounting to 230–240 million units, thanks to the strong replacement demand.<br/>
<br/>
Kuo believes Apple's upcoming &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; series will include <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/21/kuo-iphone-usb-c-faster-charging-speeds/">support for faster charging speeds</a> when used with MFi-certified USB-C chargers, including its own 20W Power Adapter, while Leaker ShrimpApplePro <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/02/28/iphone-15-usb-c-accessories-limited-without-mfi/">has said</a> that &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; models will only officially support USB-C accessories certified by the Apple Made for &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; (MFi) program. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/usb-c-power-adapter.jpg" alt="" width="1400" height="988" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-909462" /><br/>
Meanwhile Apple supplier Foxconn is said to be producing accessories like EarPods and cables with USB-C connectors that are MFi certified, and Apple is also expected to release a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/03/usb-c-airpods-pro-no-other-hardware-changes/">new AirPods Pro USB-C charging case</a>.<br/>
<br/>
At least some of the &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; models could support <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/17/iphone-15-faster-charging-speeds/">charging speeds up to 35W</a>, which would allow for quicker charging with an appropriate power adapter. It is not clear if this is a feature that will be available for all of the &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; models or just the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a> models.<br/>
<br/>
At the current time, the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-14/">iPhone 14</a> models can charge at a maximum of around 27W, with the Pro models able to charge a bit faster. An increase to 35W would speed up charging times. If the ‌&zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj;‌ models support up to 35W charging, Apple could start recommending its <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/">30W MacBook Air charger</a> or its <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/06/17/apple-35w-chargers-available-to-order/">35W Dual USB-C charger</a> for maximum charging speed.<br/>
<br/>
Overall, Apple stands to gain significant revenue from USB-C accessory sales as it effectively renders obsolete Lightning cables and connecting USB-A chargers already used by millions of Apple customers worldwide. With &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; prices <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/22/iphone-15-pro-models-expected-to-be-more-expensive/">expected to increase</a>, many customers in the market for a new model this year will also therefore have to brace themselves for the additional financial burden of replacement chargers and cables.<br/>
<br/>
Apple will unveil the &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; series at an event scheduled for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/29/apple-september-12-event-announcement/">Tuesday, September 12</a> at 10 a.m. Pacific Time.

		<description><![CDATA[In iOS 17, Siri has learned a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ios-17-siri-spotlight/">few more useful features</a> worth knowing about. One is the ability to use Siri to send messages to friends and family over compatible third-party apps. Keep reading to learn how it's done.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/07/iOS-17-Siri-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2250" height="1266" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-903813" /><br/>
When you ask ‌Siri‌ to send a message in iOS 17, you can now tap to select which app on your iPhone that you want to send it from. This allows you to send messages not just from Apple's built-in Messages app, but also third-party apps like Telegram and WhatsApp.<br/>
<br/>
The feature is compatible with any third-party app whose settings include the "Use with Ask ‌Siri‌" option. To check if an app has the option, or to enable/disable it, follow these steps.<br/>
<ol><li>Open the <strong>Settings</strong> app on your iPhone.</li><br/>
<li>Tap <strong>Siri & Search</strong>.</li><br/>
<li>Scroll down to the apps list and tap the app in question.</li><br/>
<li>Toggle the switch next to <strong>Use with Ask Siri</strong>.</li></ol><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/siri-send-message-choose-app-ios2.jpg" alt="settings" width="4320" height="2700" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-909292" /><br/>
<ul><li><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/when-will-apple-release-ios-17/">When Will iOS 17 Be Released?</a></li></ul><br/>
If "Use with Ask Siri" is enabled for a particular app, you can manually choose it each time you ask the voice assistant to send a message. Here's how.<br/>
<ol><li>Activate Siri by saying "Hey Siri" or just "Siri," or by pressing and holding the <strong>Side button</strong> on your iPhone until the Siri orb appears on the screen.</li><br/>
<li>Ask Siri to send a message to one of your contacts.</li><br/>
<li>In the message card that appears at the top of the screen, tap the<strong> Messages icon</strong> next to the person's name.</li><br/>
<li>Tap another compatible messaging app in the dropdown to select it.</li><br/>
<li>Type your message in the input field, then tap <strong>Send</strong>.</li></ol><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/siri-send-message-choose-app-ios1.jpg" alt="siri" width="2860" height="2700" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-909294" /><br/>
<br/>
There's nothing more to it. ‌In iOS 17, Siri‌ is also able to recognize and respond to multiple back-to-back requests without needing to be reactivated.<br/>
<ul><li><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/will-my-iphone-run-ios-17/">Will My iPhone Run iOS 17?</a></a></li></ul><br/>
You can, for example, ask ‌Siri‌ to tell you the time, and then follow that up with a request to text your friend that you're going to be late all in the same ‌Siri‌ request.

		<description><![CDATA[While rumors have been circulating about a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/22/iphone-15-pro-models-expected-to-be-more-expensive/">&#36;100 price increase</a> for both iPhone 15 Pro models, Taiwanese research firm TrendForce today <a href="https://www.trendforce.com/presscenter/news/20230908-11836.html">predicted</a> that the smaller iPhone 15 Pro will start at &#36;999 in the U.S., just like the iPhone 14 Pro.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/08/iPhone-15-Blue-Three-Quarters-Perspective-Feature-2.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-907068" /><br/>
TrendForce believes that only the iPhone 15 Pro Max will cost extra. The research firm predicted that the device will start at &#36;1,199 in the U.S., which would be a &#36;100 price increase compared to the iPhone 14 Pro Max. The device is expected to exclusively feature a periscope lens that enables up to 6x optical zoom, double the current limit.<br/>
<br/>
Despite predicting a price increase for the Pro Max model this year, TrendForce expects that the device will <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/07/iphone-15-pro-128gb-storage-8gb-ram-trendforce/">continue to start with 128GB of storage</a>, rather than 256GB as previously rumored. On the other hand, the research firm expects both iPhone 15 Pro models to be equipped with 8GB of RAM, up from 6GB in the iPhone 14 Pro models.<br/>
<br/>
Time will soon tell if TrendForce is accurate with its latest predictions, as Apple will unveil the iPhone 15 series at its <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/29/apple-september-12-event-announcement/">event on Tuesday, September 12</a> at 10 a.m. Pacific Time.

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's upcoming iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max will have the same 128GB, 256GB, 512GB, and 1TB storage capacity options as the iPhone 14 Pro models, according to information shared today by <a href="https://www.trendforce.com/presscenter/news/20230908-11836.html">Taiwanese research firm TrendForce</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/08/iPhone-15-Pro-Colors-Mock-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-907572" /><br/>
The research firm <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/10/25/iphone-15-pro-8gb-ram-rumor/">reiterated its claim</a> that both iPhone 15 Pro models will be equipped with 8GB of RAM, compared to 6GB for the iPhone 14 Pro models. Increased RAM can contribute to improved performance, particularly for multitasking. The lower-end iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus models will have 6GB of RAM, the research firm said.<br/>
<br/>
TrendForce believes the iPhone 15 Pro will start at &#36;999 in the U.S., just like the iPhone 14 Pro. However, the research firm predicts that the iPhone 15 Pro Max will start at &#36;1,199, which would be a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/07/iphone-15-pro-models-rumored-to-see-price-increase/">&#36;100 price increase</a> compared to the iPhone 14 Pro Max.<br/>
<br/>
All four iPhone 15 models are expected to be equipped with a USB-C port and the Dynamic Island, while many additional features are rumored for the Pro models, including a titanium frame, customizable Action button, A17 Bionic chip, Wi-Fi 6E support, a periscope lens with up to 6x optical zoom on the Pro Max, and more.<br/>
<br/>
Apple will unveil the iPhone 15 series at an event scheduled for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/29/apple-september-12-event-announcement/">Tuesday, September 12</a> at 10 a.m. Pacific Time.

<br/>
This has been one of the most consistent deals on the AirPods Pro 2 all year, and is about &#36;5 away from the all-time low price that we last saw in March. Given that we haven't tracked that rare sale again, we definitely recommend jumping on this deal if you've been waiting for a deal on the AirPods Pro 2.<br/>

<br/>
This model of the AirPods Pro can charge via Lightning, Qi, or an Apple Watch charger. We're expecting Apple to introduce a model that adds USB-C charging to the AirPods Pro 2 next week, but it could be a while before those models are discounted.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[The macOS 13.5.2, iOS 16.6.1, iPadOS 16.6.1, and watchOS 9.6.2 updates that Apple released today includes fixes for security vulnerabilities that Apple says may have been actively exploited in the wild.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/07/macbook-air-purple.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-903333" /><br/>
According to Apple's <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201222">security support page</a>, in iOS, iPadOS, and macOS, processing a maliciously crafted image could lead to arbitrary code execution, allowing a hacker to gain access to the operating system with a simple picture. Apple fixed the ImageIO process by addressing a buffer overflow issue to improve memory handling.<br/>
<br/>
In iOS, iPadOS, and watchOS, a maliciously crafted attachment in the Wallet app could also lead to arbitrary code execution. Apple addressed the validation issue with improved logic.<br/>
<br/>
As these updates include important security fixes, everyone should install iOS 16.6.1, iPadOS 16.6.1, macOS 13.5.2, and watchOS 9.6.2 as soon as possible. Apple recommends these software updates for all users.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Update</b>: As <a href="https://citizenlab.ca/2023/09/blastpass-nso-group-iphone-zero-click-zero-day-exploit-captured-in-the-wild/">reported by Citizen Lab</a>, the vulnerabilities are part of a "BLASTPASS" exploit chain that was observed having been used in the wild to deliver NSO Group's Pegasus spyware. Pegasus is of critical concern to government officials, journalists, activists, and others with potentially sensitive information on their devices.<br/>
<br/>
The zero-click vulnerability allowed attackers to send a maliciously crafted PassKit (Wallet) image to a target via iMessage, infecting their device "without any interaction from the victim."<br/>
<br/>
The attacks can be blocked by applying today's updates or by enabling Lockdown Mode on your device.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-16/">iOS 16</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-16/">iPadOS 16</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-13/">macOS Ventura</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-16.238">iOS 16</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macos-ventura.239">macOS Ventura</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/07/ios-16-6-1-macos-13-5-2-active-vulnerabilities/">PSA: Make Sure to Update, iOS 16.6.1 and macOS 13.5.2 Address Actively Exploited Vulnerability</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/psa-make-sure-to-update-ios-16-6-1-and-macos-13-5-2-address-actively-exploited-vulnerability.2400732/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>
