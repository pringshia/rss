		<description><![CDATA[Apple's new iPad Pro models with OLED displays will likely begin shipping to customers in April, according to <a href="https://www.displaysupplychain.com/blog/the-latest-insights-on-the-apple-oled-ipad-ramp">information shared today by Ross Young</a>, CEO of display industry research firm Display Supply Chain Consultants.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/M3-iPad-Feature-3.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-917548" /><br/>
<em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman also said the new iPad Pro models might not ship until "deeper" into April <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-03-17/apple-aapl-revamped-carplay-becomes-last-hope-after-apple-car-is-canceled-ltvif8zt">in his <em>Power On</em> newsletter</a> on Sunday:<blockquote>I've repeatedly said that new software for the iPad Pro — a variant of iPadOS 17.4 designed for the updated models —  won't be complete until the end of March or even sometime in April. Once the OS is finished, Apple needs to send it off to the factories to be installed on the new hardware. That process could last a couple weeks, probably taking us deeper into next month.</blockquote>Young expects Apple to announce the new iPad Pro models in "late March or early April," so the devices could still be unveiled later this month. Gurman has also said that an announcement is possible <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/11/new-ipads-end-of-march-or-april-gurman/">as early as the "end of March."</a><br/>
<br/>
Young reiterated that Apple plans to launch a larger 12.9-inch iPad Air as well, and it will likely be announced alongside the new iPad Pro models.<br/>
<br/>
The following iPad-related announcements are expected in March or April:<ul><li>Two new iPad Pro models with the M3 chip, OLED displays, a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/20/upcoming-oled-ipad-pro-thinner/">thinner enclosure</a>, a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/08/ipad-air-ipad-pro-landscape-facetime-camera/">landscape-oriented front camera</a>, a redesigned rear camera bump and other design tweaks, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/18/ipad-pro-magsafe-charging/">possibly MagSafe wireless charging</a></li><br/>
<li>Two new iPad Air models with the M2 chip and a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/08/ipad-air-ipad-pro-landscape-facetime-camera/">landscape-oriented front camera</a>, including a first-ever 12.9-inch model</li><br/>
<li>A new Magic Keyboard for the iPad Pro with a larger trackpad, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/03/gurman-new-ipad-magic-keyboard-to-feature-aluminum/">a partially-aluminum enclosure</a>, and other design tweaks</li><br/>
<li>A <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/05/new-apple-pencil-to-launch-this-month/">new Apple Pencil</a></li></ul>Gurman previously <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/03/no-apple-event-for-new-ipads-macs-gurman/">ruled out an Apple Event for the new iPads</a>. Instead, the devices will likely be announced in a press release on the Apple Newsroom website, like the 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Air models with the M3 chip <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/04/apple-announces-m3-macbook-air/">were earlier this month</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Young said Samsung will be the exclusive supplier of OLED displays for the 12.9-inch iPad Pro, while Samsung and LG will apparently split orders for the 11.1-inch model.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/">iPad Air </a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ross-young/">Ross Young</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPad-Air">iPad Air (Don't Buy)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#11-iPad-Pro">11" iPad Pro (Don't Buy)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#12-9-iPad-Pro">12.9" iPad Pro (Don't Buy)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipad.137">iPad</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/18/new-ipads-likely-to-begin-shipping-in-april/">New iPads Likely to Begin Shipping in April</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/new-ipads-likely-to-begin-shipping-in-april.2422217/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Since Apple unveiled <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/07/apple-releases-macos-sonoma-14-4/">macOS Sonoma 14.4 on March 7</a>, the transition to the latest software update has not been entirely smooth for everyone, and a number of issues have been reported by users that significantly impact their daily workflow.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/Reasons-to-Not-Upgrade-to-macOS-Sonoma-14.4-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-941874" /><br/>
This article lists the most prominent challenges users have faced since updating to macOS Sonoma 14.4, and offers potential solutions where available.<br/>
<br><br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px; color: #4A90E2; margin-top: 2px;">USB Hub and Monitor Ports</span><br><br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 14px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #4A90E2; padding: 3px 6px; border-radius: 4px; margin-bottom: 2px;">Lost Connectivity</span><br><br/>
Some users have experienced <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/13/macos-sonoma-14-4-usb-hub-issues-reported/">connectivity issues with USB hubs and monitors with USB ports</a> since updating to macOS 14.4, with several reports of mice, keyboards, and other peripherals no longer being detected. While Apple works on a fix, a handful of users have had some success by changing the setting "Allow accessories to connect" to "Ask for new accessories" under the Security section of System Settings ➝ Privacy & Security.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px; color: #4A90E2; margin-top: 2px;">Java Processes </span><br><br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 14px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #4A90E2; padding: 3px 6px; border-radius: 4px; margin-bottom: 2px;">Unexpected Terminations</span><br><br/>
Oracle last week warned that the macOS 14.4 update can cause Java processes to "<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/16/oracle-warns-about-macos-14-4-java-issues/">terminate unexpectedly</a>" on Macs. The issue affects all Java versions from Java 8 to the early access builds of JDK 22, and there is no workaround available. Affected users might be unable to return to a stable configuration unless they have a complete backup of their systems prior to the OS update.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px; color: #4A90E2; margin-top: 2px;">Printer Operation</span><br><br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 14px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #4A90E2; padding: 3px 6px; border-radius: 4px; margin-bottom: 2px;">Removed or Corrupted Drivers</span><br><br/>
The update may <a href="https://discussions.apple.com/thread/255522015?sortBy=best">remove or corrupt printer drivers</a>. Specifically, the core CUPS software for printing operations over a network seems to be removed. HP printers in particular appear to be affected, but the exact commonalities between the reports, such as the use of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MacOS/comments/1b9n1mj/new_mac_os_144_update_broke_printing_no_drivers/">Microsoft Defender or JAMF mobile device management software</a>, are not entirely clear. Some users have found a workaround by granting Full Disk Access to certain processes in System Settings ➝ Privacy & Security. Despite these attempts, a comprehensive solution has not yet been found.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px; color: #4A90E2; margin-top: 2px;">PACE/iLok Protections</span><br><br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 14px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #4A90E2; padding: 3px 6px; border-radius: 4px; margin-bottom: 2px;">Audio Unit Plugins Crash</span><br><br/>
There have been reports of compatibility issues with PACE products, including the <a href="https://help.ilok.com/faq_licenses.html#sonoma_14_4_plugins">iLok License Manager</a>, connected to Apple silicon Macs running macOS 14.4. The problem specifically impacts plugins from various manufacturers that are safeguarded by PACE/iLok, including those <a href="https://help.uaudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/24492336117652-PACE-iLok-Issue-with-macOS-Sonoma-14-4-Update">made by Universal Audio</a>, when used with host DAWs such as Logic Pro. Temporarily setting a DAW and the iLok License Manager application to <a href="https://help.ilok.com/faq_licenses.html#sonoma_14_4_plugins">run in Rosetta mode</a> appears to circumvent the issue. <br/>
<br/>
<h2>Consider Not Updating</h2><br/>
If you anticipate that any of these problems could significantly impact your daily operations or productivity, it may be prudent to delay updating to the latest version of macOS Sonoma until Apple addresses these concerns with a subsequent fix. Have you identified any other issues since updating? Let us know in the comments and we might include them here if they turn out to be commonplace.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sonoma/">macOS Sonoma</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macos-sonoma.243">macOS Sonoma</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/18/do-not-update-macos-sonoma-14-4/">macOS Sonoma 14.4: Reasons Not to Update</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/macos-sonoma-14-4-reasons-not-to-update.2422216/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's latest ad for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a> models focuses on the device's storage, highlighting the 128GB of available storage space for the entry-level device.<br/>
<br/>

The ad features a man looking through his photos, and each photo on the device sings "Don't Let Go" by Terrace Martin, Mr. Talkbox, and PJ Morton. He ultimately decides not to delete his images. The spot ends with the tagline "Lots of storage for lots of photos."<br/>
<br/>
While the standard &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; models and the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a> models start with 128GB of storage, Apple offers 256GB and 512GB upgrade options, with an additional 1TB option for the &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj;.

		<description><![CDATA[Apple researchers have developed a new method for training large language models (LLMs) that seamlessly integrates both text and visual information. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/03/hey-siri-banner-apple.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="630" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-840591" /><br/>
The company's findings, detailed in a research paper titled "<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09611">MM1: Methods, Analysis & Insights from Multimodal LLM Pre-training</a>," showcase a new approach to creating more intelligent and flexible AI systems. By utilizing a diverse dataset comprising image-caption pairs, interleaved image-text documents, and text-only data, Apple's claims that the MM1 model sets a new standard in AI's ability to perform tasks such as image captioning, visual question answering, and natural language inference with a high level of accuracy.<br/>
<br/>
Apple's research focuses on the combination of different types of training data and model architectures, which enables the AI to understand and generate language based on a mix of visual and linguistic cues. This capability is vital for tasks that require a nuanced comprehension of the world, such as interpreting complex images or answering questions that involve visual elements.<br/>
<br/>
The paper also highlights the MM1 model's exceptional in-context learning abilities, particularly in the largest 30 billion parameter configuration of the model. This version apparently exhibits remarkable capabilities for multi-step reasoning over multiple images using few-shot "chain-of-thought" prompting, a technique that allows the AI to perform complex, open-ended problem solving based on minimal examples. <br/>
<br/>
This research emerges as part of Apple's broader initiative to enhance its AI capabilities amid growing competition. Earlier today, <em>Bloomberg</em>'s <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a> <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/18/apple-google-gemini-ios-18-iphone/">reported</a> that Apple is in discussions with Google to license Google's Gemini generative large-language models to power new features coming to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> as part of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a>.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/artificial-intelligence/">Artificial Intelligence</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/18/apple-mm1-ai-model-details/">Apple Publishes Details About New &#039;MM1&#039; AI Model</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-publishes-details-about-new-mm1-ai-model.2422211/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The next-generation iPad Air will be equipped with a landscape front camera, according to the <a href="https://twitter.com/VNchocoTaco/status/1769727515453800930">leaker known as "ShrimpApplePro."</a><br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/iPad-Air-5-Colors-16x9.jpg" alt="" width="1494" height="840" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-941843" /><br/>
If this information is accurate, the front camera on the next iPad Air would be located in the bezel to the right of the screen when the device is held upright. As a result, the front camera would be positioned at the top of the iPad when the device is in landscape orientation, making it centered with the user's eyes during video calls. This change would be especially beneficial to those who use the iPad Air with a Magic Keyboard.<br/>
<br/>
On the current iPad Air, the front camera is in the top bezel above the screen, resulting in it being off-center in landscape orientation.<br/>
<br/>
The leaker does not expect the next iPad Air to have any other significant design changes. They also cast doubt on a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/10/12-9-inch-ipad-air-display-shipments/">larger 12.9-inch iPad Air</a>, but that model has been widely rumored by multiple sources, so it would be surprising if it did not launch.<br/>
<br/>
A landscape front camera had already been rumored for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/08/ipad-air-ipad-pro-landscape-facetime-camera/">both the next iPad Pro and iPad Air</a>, so it is becoming an increasingly likely design change. Apple already repositioned the front camera on the entry-level iPad 10 a few years ago, so it would make sense for the change to be expanded to the entire iPad lineup eventually.<br/>
<br/>
"During ‌Face ID‌ setup, iPad needs to be in landscape with the camera at the top of the screen," read <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/25/ipad-pro-landscape-face-id-camera/">hidden code in iPadOS 17.4</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Apple is expected to unveil new iPads in late March or in April.<br/>
<br/>
"ShrimpApplePro" has a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/shrimpapplepro/">mixed track record</a> with Apple rumors over the past few years. The leaker accurately revealed details about devices like the iPhone 15 Pro and Apple Watch Series 9, but they were incorrect about the Apple Watch Ultra 2 being available in a Space Black finish and the iPad mini being updated in 2023. <div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/">iPad Air </a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/shrimpapplepro/">ShrimpApplePro</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPad-Air">iPad Air (Don't Buy)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipad.137">iPad</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/18/ipad-air-landscape-front-camera-rumor/">Next iPad Air Again Rumored to Feature Landscape Front Camera</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/next-ipad-air-again-rumored-to-feature-landscape-front-camera.2422205/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[iOS 17.4.1 and iPadOS 17.4.1 should be released within the next few days, with a build number of 21E235, according to a source with a proven track record.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/General-iOS-17-Feature-Orange-Purple.jpg" alt="" width="2250" height="1266" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-898582" /><br/>
<em>MacRumors</em> previously reported that Apple was <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/11/apple-preparing-ios-17-4-1/">internally testing iOS 17.4.1</a>. As a minor update for the iPhone, it will likely address software bugs and/or security vulnerabilities. It is unclear if the update will include any other changes.<br/>
<br/>
As to be expected, Apple has also been internally testing iOS 17.5, and the first beta of that update is likely to be released this week.<br/>
<br/>
We consider it likely that there will also be a macOS 14.4.1 update for the Mac at some point, as there have been complaints about several bugs on macOS 14.4 <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/13/macos-sonoma-14-4-usb-hub-issues-reported/">related to USB hubs</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/16/oracle-warns-about-macos-14-4-java-issues/">Java</a>, Bluetooth, printers, audio plugins, and more.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-17/">iPadOS 17</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-17.241">iOS 17</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-17.242">iPadOS 17</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/18/ios-17-4-1-is-imminent/">iOS 17.4.1 Update for iPhone is Imminent</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-17-4-1-update-for-iphone-is-imminent.2422201/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple is widely expected to release new iPad Air and OLED iPad Pro models in the next few weeks. According to new rumors coming out of Asia, the company will announce its new iPads on Tuesday, March 26.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/12/When-To-Expect-New-iPads-Feature-1.jpg" alt="" width="2250" height="1265" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-925410" /><br/>
Chinese leaker Instant Digital on Weibo this morning <a href="https://s.weibo.com/weibo?q=%23新款iPad或3月26日发布%23">claimed</a> that the date will see some sort of announcement from Apple related to new iPads, but stopped short of calling it an official launch date. Instead, Apple could announce pre-order availability, with shipping dates to follow.<br/>
<br/>
Separately, Chinese website <em><a href="https://www.ithome.com/0/756/324.htm">IT Home</a></em> claimed that March 26 will see Apple release new iPads. However, the outlet appears to have interpreted this as a launch date based on when several Amazon listings for third-party protective cases for the new iPads go live, rather than specific information from a trusted source.<br/>
<br/>
According to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/11/new-ipads-end-of-march-or-april-gurman/"><em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman</a>, Apple plans to release new iPad Pro and iPad Air models around the end of March or in April. That said, the well-connected reporter now seems to be leaning more towards the possibility of an April release.<br/>
<br/>
Writing in the latest subscriber edition of his <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-03-17/apple-aapl-revamped-carplay-becomes-last-hope-after-apple-car-is-canceled-ltvif8zt">Power On newsletter</a>, Gurman said he wanted to clear up confusion about when he believed Apple would release new iPads (specifically new iPad Pro models). <br/>
<br/>
Gurman reiterated that a new variant of iPadOS 17.4 designed for the updated models won't be complete until the end of March or even sometime in April. "Once the OS is finished, Apple needs to send it off to the factories to be installed on the new hardware. That process could last a couple weeks, probably taking us deeper into next month," he wrote.<br/>
<br/>
Two new iPad Pro models are expected to feature a new M3 chip, OLED displays, a thinner enclosure, a landscape-oriented front camera, a redesigned camera bump, and possibly MagSafe wireless charging.<br/>
<br/>
The two new iPad Air models are expected to feature Apple's M2 chip and a landscape-oriented front camera, including a first-ever 12.9-inch model.<br/>
<br/>
Other announcements expected in the March-April window include a new Magic Keyboard for the iPad Pro with a larger trackpad, and a new Apple Pencil.<br/>
<br/>
Gurman previously <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/03/no-apple-event-for-new-ipads-macs-gurman/">ruled out an Apple Event for the new iPads</a>. Instead, he believes they will be announced in a press release on the Apple Newsroom website, like the new 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Air models were earlier this month.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/">iPad Air </a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/instant-digital/">Instant Digital</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPad-Air">iPad Air (Don't Buy)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#11-iPad-Pro">11" iPad Pro (Don't Buy)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#12-9-iPad-Pro">12.9" iPad Pro (Don't Buy)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipad.137">iPad</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/18/new-ipads-march-26-launch-date-rumor/">Apple to Announce New iPads on March 26, Rumors Claim</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-to-announce-new-ipads-on-march-26-rumors-claim.2422198/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple is in discussions with Google to integrate its Gemini AI engine into the iPhone as part of iOS 18, according to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-03-18/apple-in-talks-to-license-google-gemini-for-iphone-ios-18-generative-ai-tools"><em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/google-gemini.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-941761" /><br/>
In a report citing people familiar with the situation, Gurman claims the two companies are in "active negotiations" to let Apple license Google's generative large-language models in order to power some new features coming in iOS 18. <br/>
<br/>
"The two parties haven't decided the terms or branding of an AI agreement or finalized how it would be implemented," according to the report's sources.<br/>
<br/>
With the release of iOS 18 later this year, Apple is rumored to be bringing major new AI capabilities to its iPhone operating system. According to Gurman, however, Apple is focusing on features that operate on-device and do not require an internet connection. <br/>
<br/>
To power additional cloud-based generative AI features, such as the ability to create images and write essays based on single prompts, Apple is seeking a partner that has the necessary large-scale hardware infrastructure and compute capabilities already in place.<br/>
<br/>
According to previous reporting by Gurman, Apple has been internally testing an "Apple GPT" rival that could compete with OpenAI's ChatGPT. The company has also been designing an "Ajax" framework for large language models, and is said to be spending <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/06/apple-conversational-ai-spending/">millions of dollars a day</a> on conversational AI research as training language models requires a lot of hardware.<br/>
<br/>
However, the technology is still not as advanced as tools from Google and other rivals, making a partnership look like the better option, according to the latest report.<br/>
<br/>
If the negotiations come to nothing, Apple could seek another generative AI provider such as OpenAI or turn to multiple partners. But if the talks bring about a deal, it could make up for any losses that result from the regulatory pressure facing the two companies' existing search partnership. <br/>
<br/>
Google has paid Apple billions of dollars for several years to keep its search engine the default option in Safari browser on Apple devices. However, the existing deal is facing regulatory scrutiny from the U.S. Department of Justice and the European Commission over concerns that it helps Google maintain a search monopoly. <br/>
<br/>
Both <em>The Information</em> and analyst Jeff Pu claim that Apple will have some kind of generative AI feature available on the ‌iPhone‌ and iPad <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/19/apple-generative-ai-late-2024-jeff-pu/">around late 2024</a>, which is when iOS 18 will be coming out. However, Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/02/no-sign-of-apple-generative-ai-coming-2024/">said in August</a> that there is "no sign" of generative AI technology coming in 2024, and he claimed that Apple's work on generative AI is "significantly behind its competitors."<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a></div><div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/bloomberg-com/">Bloomberg</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-gpt/">Apple GPT</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/18/apple-google-gemini-ios-18-iphone/">Apple in Talks With Google to Bring Gemini AI Features to iPhone</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-in-talks-with-google-to-bring-gemini-ai-features-to-iphone.2422190/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple suppliers will begin production of two new fourth-generation AirPods models in May, according to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-03-17/apple-aapl-revamped-carplay-becomes-last-hope-after-apple-car-is-canceled-ltvif8zt"><em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman</a>. Based on this production timeframe, he expects the headphones to be released in September or October.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/04/airpods-3-orange.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-893120" /><br/>
Gurman expects both fourth-generation AirPods models to feature a new design with better fit, improved sound quality, and an updated charging case with a USB-C port. The higher-end ones will also feature active noise cancellation and a speaker in the charging case that can play a sound for Find My location tracking, he said.<br/>
<br/>
Apple plans to discontinue the second-generation and third-generation AirPods after launching the two fourth-generation models, he previously said.<br/>
<br/>
Gurman does not expect new AirPods Pro to launch until next year at the earliest, but he said the current models will get a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/11/airpods-pro-to-gain-hearing-aid-mode-ios-18/">new hearing aid mode with iOS 18</a>.

		<description><![CDATA[<em>MacRumors</em> was first to report that Apple was <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/28/apple-id-to-apple-account-rebrand/">planning to rebrand "Apple ID" to "Apple Account"</a> across its software platforms and websites like iCloud.com as early as this year, and now <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-03-17/apple-aapl-revamped-carplay-becomes-last-hope-after-apple-car-is-canceled-ltvif8zt"><em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman</a> has corroborated this change.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/iOS-17-Passkey-With-Apple-ACCOUNT-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-941734" /><em>A mockup of the new Apple Account branding</em></div><br/>
In his <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-03-17/apple-aapl-revamped-carplay-becomes-last-hope-after-apple-car-is-canceled-ltvif8zt"><em>Power On</em> newsletter</a> today, Gurman said the new "Apple Account" branding will start to be used later this year both online and in Apple's next major software releases, such as iOS 18 for the iPhone and watchOS 11 for the Apple Watch.<br/>
<br/>
Apple already refers to funds added to an Apple ID as an "<a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208687">Apple Account balance</a>," and Gurman said there is an "Apple Account" team within the company. With the full rebranding later this year, the term Apple ID is expected to be completely phased out, over two decades after the company started using it. Apple's reasoning behind the decision is not known, but "Apple Account" would be more straightforward branding.<br/>
<br/>
Apple will preview iOS 18 and its other major software updates at its developers conference WWDC in June, and the rebranding to "Apple Account" will likely be announced then. The updates should be widely released in September.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-id/">Apple ID</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/17/apple-id-rebrand-to-apple-account-ios-18/">&#039;Apple ID&#039; Expected to Change to &#039;Apple Account&#039; Starting With iOS 18</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-id-expected-to-change-to-apple-account-starting-with-ios-18.2422155/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's relocated store at the Square One shopping mall in Mississauga, Ontario will hold its grand opening on Saturday, March 23 at 10 a.m. local time, according to updated wording on the store's construction facade, shared with us  <a href="https://twitter.com/ApolloZhaoD/status/1769095750946865601">by Apollo Zhao</a>. Mississauga is located just west of Toronto, the most populous city in Canada.<br/>

Thursday, March 21 <a href="https://www.apple.com/ca/retail/squareone/">will be the final day of business</a> at Apple's existing Square One store, which originally opened in August 2009.<br/>
<br/>
The new store is located on the second floor of Square One, above the central food court, and it has a very wide, partially-curved facade. It has a significantly larger footprint than the existing store, which will allow it to better accommodate the heavy customer traffic at Canada's second-largest indoor shopping mall.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Oracle this week warned that the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/07/apple-releases-macos-sonoma-14-4/">macOS 14.4 update</a> released earlier this month for Macs can cause Java processes to "terminate unexpectedly."<br/>

In a <a href="https://blogs.oracle.com/java/post/java-on-macos-14-4">blog post</a> on Friday, Oracle's Senior Director of Product Management Aurelio Garcia-Ribeyro recommended that Apple silicon Mac users who rely on Java avoid updating to macOS 14.4 until the issue is resolved by Apple:<blockquote>An issue introduced by macOS 14.4, which causes Java process[es] to terminate unexpectedly, is affecting all Java versions from Java 8 to the early access builds of JDK 22. There is no workaround available, and since there is no easy way to revert a macOS update, affected users might be unable to return to a stable configuration unless they have a complete backup of their systems prior to the OS update.</blockquote>The blog post and <a href="https://bugs.java.com/bugdatabase/view_bug?bug_id=8327860">bug report</a> include more technical details about the issue.<br/>

Oracle says it has notified Apple about the issue. Apple did not immediately respond to our request for comment about the matter.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[After over a year of reports, there are now more than a dozen specific rumors about the features and improvements set to be offered by the two non-Pro <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a> models later in 2024. <br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/iPhone-14-vs-16-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-941488" /></div><br/>
While the upgrades that the &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; offers over the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a> will likely be at the center of Apple's marketing strategy later this year, many users are on two-year upgrade cycles, so the features introduced on both the &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; will stack up. All of the changes the &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; models are expected to feature compared to their two direct forerunners are listed below, using information from a range of reliable sources that we have <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">previously covered</a>. We will update this article as more rumors emerge in the coming months.<br/>
<br/>
This guide focuses on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-14/">iPhone 14</a> and &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj;, but to learn about how we are expecting the &zwnj;iPhone 14&zwnj; Pro to improve on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/">iPhone 16 Pro</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone-14-pro-vs-iphone-16-pro/">see our other comparison article</a>. <br/>
<br/>
<h3 id="design">Design</h3><br/>
The &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; Plus are expected to largely carry over the design of their predecessors. As a result, the &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; will be a relatively significant evolution over the ‌&zwnj;iPhone 14&zwnj;‌, featuring slightly rounded edges, a frosted glass back, and a vertical rear camera arrangement to facilitate spatial video capture. Other important design changes are expected to include the removal of the mute switch in favor of the Action button introduced on last year's Pro models and the introduction of an all-new "Capture" button.<br/>

The &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; introduced a major camera upgrade for Apple's standard smartphone lineup, bringing over the 48-megapixel camera of the &zwnj;iPhone 14&zwnj; Pro. With a number of other improvements such as spatial video capture, the &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; should be a significant camera upgrade over the &zwnj;iPhone 14&zwnj;. <br/>

With the &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; models rumored to receive the same A18 chip as the Pro models, the new models could offer a major performance improvement over the &zwnj;iPhone 14&zwnj;, which features the A15 Bionic chip first introduced in 2021. The 2GB of additional memory and the second-generation Ultra Wideband chip are also due to be notable upgrades. <br/>

While many of Apple's devices are rumored to receive a series of new AI-based features via software updates later this year, the &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; models are expected to take these further with exclusive capabilities facilitated by a more powerful Neural Engine in the A18 chip and an upgraded microphone.<br/>

<h2 id="will_it_be_worth_upgrading">Will It Be Worth Upgrading?</h2><br/>
The ‌&zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; was a fairly significant upgrade over the ‌&zwnj;iPhone 14&zwnj;‌ in 2023, introducing a more modern design with the &zwnj;Dynamic Island&zwnj;, a USB-C port, and q 48-megapixel camera. The ‌&zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; will build on these upgrades, offering the Capture and Action buttons, AI features, and spatial video capture. With over 30 upgrades rumored to be in store, many ‌current &zwnj;iPhone 14&zwnj;‌ users will find upgrading to an ‌&zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; model worthwhile, if not essential.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="release_date">Release Date</h2><br/>
The &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; Plus are expected to launch in the fall.

		<description><![CDATA[Apple news and rumors settled down a bit this week following the launch of the M3 MacBook Air, but there was still plenty to talk about including Apple's ongoing changes to satisfy the EU's Digital Markets Act and signs of an upcoming iOS update likely to address some bugs.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/top-stories-16mar2024.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-941512" /><br/>
We're also looking forward to new iPad Pro and iPad Air models coming in the next few weeks or so, plus the iPhone 16 lineup later this year, so read on for the latest on these stories and more!<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Apple Announces Ability to Download iPhone Apps From Websites in EU</h2><br/>
Apple this week announced that <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/12/apple-announces-app-downloads-from-websites/">iPhone users in the EU will soon be able to download apps directly from the websites</a> of eligible developers. Apple says web distribution will be available in a software update that will be released "later this spring," which likely refers to iOS 17.5.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/Apple-EU-iOS-Changes.jpg" alt="" width="1312" height="738" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-933094" /><br/>
Apple already <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/25/ios-17-4-alternative-app-marketplaces-eu/">added support for alternative app marketplaces</a> on the iPhone in the EU with iOS 17.4, released earlier this month.<br/>
<br/>
These changes are a result of the EU's Digital Markets Act, which Apple has strongly opposed but reluctantly complied with.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Apple Preparing iOS 17.4.1 Update for iPhone</h2><br/>
Apple is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/11/apple-preparing-ios-17-4-1/">internally testing iOS 17.4.1 for the iPhone</a>, based on evidence of the software update in our website's logs this week. It is unclear exactly when the update will be released to the public.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/iOS-17.4.1-Feature-Joe-Blue.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-940545" /><br/>
Our logs have revealed the existence of several iOS 17 versions before Apple released them, ranging from iOS 17.0.3 to iOS 17.3.1. iOS 17.4.1 should be a minor update that addresses software bugs and/or security vulnerabilities.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>2024 iPad Pro: Key Rumors to Be Aware of Ahead of Announcement</h2><br/>
<em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman expects new iPad Pro and iPad Air models to be <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/11/new-ipads-end-of-march-or-april-gurman/">released towards the "end of March" or in April</a>. He also expects new Magic Keyboard and Apple Pencil accessories to be released for iPads simultaneously.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/M3-iPad-Feature-3.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-917548" /><br/>

<h2>Video Comparison: M3 MacBook Air vs. M3 MacBook Pro</h2><br/>
Earlier this month, Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/04/apple-announces-m3-macbook-air/">updated the 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Air</a> with its latest-generation M3 chip, Wi-Fi 6E support, and compatibility with two external displays when the laptop's lid is closed.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/M3-Pro-vs.-M3-Air-Thumb-2.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-940924" /><br/>
In a recent video on our YouTube channel, we <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/12/m3-macbook-air-vs-macbook-pro/">compared the new MacBook Air with the base model 14-inch MacBook Pro with the M3 chip</a>.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Best Buy is selling the <a href="https://howl.me/clLm50orOos">13-inch M1 MacBook Air for &#36;649.99</a>, which is the lowest price that we've seen to date on the machine. Best Buy's price drop comes just hours after Walmart <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/15/walmart-selling-macbook-air-with-m1-chip/">started selling</a> the M1 MacBook Air for &#36;699.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Just after Apple announced the new 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Air models, Best Buy started selling the M1 MacBook Air for &#36;750, so the price has come down &#36;100 in the last 10 days. The model that Best Buy has for &#36;649.99 is the entry-level version with 8GB Unified Memory, an 8-core CPU, a 7-core GPU, and a 256GB SSD.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://howl.me/clLm50orOos"target="_blank"><div class="fancybutton"><div class="fancybadge">&#36;350 OFF</div>13-inch M1 MacBook Air for &#36;649.99</div></a></div><br/>
<br/>
Apple discontinued the M1 MacBook Air on March 4, which is why we're seeing such low prices on remaining inventory. The M1 MacBook Air first came out in 2020, so it is four years old at this point, but the Apple silicon chip is still more than adequate for day-to-day tasks. <a href="https://howl.me/clLm50orOos">&#36;649 is a great price</a> for those who want to get an Apple silicon Mac while also saving some cash.<br/>
<br/>
As the M1 MacBook Air is no longer being manufactured, available supply is likely to dry up soon.

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today made the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/visionos/">visionOS</a> <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a> <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/vision">available on the web</a>, giving Vision Pro users and prospective owners a way to see what apps are available for the device.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/Vision-Pro-Apps-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-934149" /><br/>
As noted by <em><a href="https://9to5mac.com/2024/03/15/apple-gives-users-a-new-way-to-browse-vision-pros-app-store/">9to5Mac</a></em>, Vision Pro apps can be viewed by going to the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; for <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/vision">Apple Vision Pro web page</a>. Apple has dedicated sections for apps and games, along with a separate tab for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-arcade/">Apple Arcade</a> games that can be used on Vision Pro.<br/>
<br/>
Apps are organized into the same categories that are available on the Vision Pro, such as What's New, Hot This Week, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> Games for Vision Pro, and Don't Miss. Apps can also be viewed by type, with Apple organizing them into options like Weather, Utility, Entertainment, Sports, Productivity, and more.<br/>
<br/>
The option to view available Vision Pro apps gives those without the headset a central location to check out the available software before deciding whether to make a purchase. Vision Pro apps <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/01/apple-vision-pro-apps-app-store-website/">have been listed individually</a> on the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; website since launch, but until now, there was no way to get an overview of all available content except on the Vision Pro itself.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/visionos/">visionOS</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-vision-pro.209">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/15/visionos-app-store-web/">You Can Now Browse Vision Pro Apps on the Web</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/you-can-now-browse-vision-pro-apps-on-the-web.2422048/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> is Apple's top-selling product, and it gets an update every year. In 2024, we're expecting the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/">iPhone 16 Pro</a> lineup, with an arguably more interesting feature set than we got with the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oFircs10BaA" title="iPhone 16: 5 Key New Features!" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe><em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/macrumors?sub_confirmation=1">Subscribe to the MacRumors YouTube channel</a> for more videos.</em></div><br/>
<h2>Capture Button</h2><br/>
All four &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; models are set to get a whole new button, which will be located on the right side of the device below the Power button. In the United States, this is where the mmWave 5G antenna is, so Apple will be shifting that over to the other side.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/iPhone-16-Camera-Lozenge-2-Perspective-Gray.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-935281" /><br/>
This addition, which Apple calls the "Capture Button," will be for taking photos and videos when the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; is held in a landscape orientation. It seems aimed specifically at capturing 3D landscape video that will then be viewed on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a>, but it will also be useful for taking regular video and photos as well.<br/>
<br/>
Rumors suggest the button will be a standard mechanical button like the Power and Volume buttons, but it will support multiple levels of pressure. You'll be able to press down lightly to focus, and then press down further to snap a picture or start recording. The feel will be similar to a multi-function camera shutter button.<br/>
<br/>
As a bonus, the standard &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; models will also get the Action Button that was introduced with the &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; and Pro Max, so both the Action Button and Capture Button will be available across the entire lineup.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Display Sizes</h2><br/>
Apple has been using 6.1 and 6.7-inch display sizes for all &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; generations since the 2020 &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 12 models, but display sizes are finally set to increase slightly in 2024. The &zwnj;iPhone 16 Pro&zwnj; display is expected to be approximately 6.3 inches, while the &zwnj;iPhone 16 Pro&zwnj; Max display will be approximately 6.9 inches.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/iPhone-16-Pro-Front-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-928695" /><br/>
Screen sizes are bigger because the &zwnj;iPhone 16 Pro&zwnj; and 16 Pro Max will be about 3mm taller, and around 1mm wider. Thickness isn't increasing, but weight will go up just a bit because of size jump.<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately, the size change will be limited to the &zwnj;iPhone 16 Pro&zwnj; and Pro Max this year, and the &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; and 16 Plus will still measure in at 6.1 inches and 6.7 inches, respectively.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Camera Upgrades</h2><br/>
Apple has camera changes in store for all of the &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; models. For the &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; Plus, there will be a new vertical lens arrangement that does away with the diagonal arrangement Apple has used for the last several years. The change is expected to let the &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; models capture spatial video, a feature limited to the 15 Pro and Pro Max right now.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/iPhone-16-Camera-Lozenge-2-Colors.jpg" alt="" width="2250" height="1265" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-935159" /><br/>
The biggest update will be limited to the &zwnj;iPhone 16 Pro&zwnj; and Pro Max, though. Apple is upgrading the Ultra Wide camera to 48 megapixels, bringing improved images in lower lighting conditions. The lens is expected to work like the 48-megapixel Wide camera, which uses pixel binning to combine the data from four pixels into one "super pixel" for better image quality.<br/>
<br/>
Since spatial video recording uses both the Wide and Ultra Wide cameras, spatial videos will get a boost with the new Pro models.<br/>
<br/>
Apple is also going to bring the 5x Telephoto lens to the &zwnj;iPhone 16 Pro&zwnj; this year, and that's presumably possible because of those aforementioned size increases. 5X optical zoom is available on the 15 Pro Max right now, but both Pro models will get it in 2024.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Faster 5G</h2><br/>
With the &zwnj;iPhone 16 Pro&zwnj; and Pro Max, Apple plans to adopt Qualcomm's latest Snapdragon X75 modem chip. Modem chips aren't often a major feature that we highlight, especially since the transition to 5G, but the X75 will be faster while also using less power.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/qualcomm-x75-chip.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="720" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-941580" /><br/>
It offers 10-carrier aggregation for mmWave and 5x carrier aggregation for sub-6GHz. Carrier aggregation improves data speeds, so a higher number equates to lower latency and more data throughput. The modem chip has a second-generation AI processor inside that Qualcomm says will improve speeds, coverage, link robustness, and location accuracy. You might see fewer connection issues in parking garages, elevators, and subways.<br/>
<br/>
The X75 merges the sub-6GHz and mmWave transceivers, so there's 25 percent less circuit board space used and less power draw. So far, rumors suggest that the X75 will be limited to the Pro models in 2024, with the standard models to continue to use the X70 in the current &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; lineup.<br/>
<br/>
Along with better 5G, Apple could also bring Wi-Fi 7 to the &zwnj;iPhone 16 Pro&zwnj; models. Wi-Fi 7 supports speeds up to 40Gb/s, and could result in lower latency and more reliable connectivity. As for the &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj;, we're expecting to see an upgrade to Wi-Fi 6E, allowing them to connect to 6GHz networks. The 15 Pro models support Wi-Fi 6E, but the standard &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; models are limited to Wi-Fi 6.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Generative AI</h2><br/>
Apple is focusing on AI in a big way in 2024 as it aims to catch up with Microsoft, Google, OpenAI, and other companies that have invested heavily in generative AI. AI is software based, of course, but it needs hardware to support it.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/iOS-18-Mock-Siri-Feature-Baubles.jpg" alt="" width="2250" height="1266" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-909208" /><br/>
With <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a>, Apple is rumored to be making some major AI-based improvements and introducing AI across the operating system, and some of the most advanced features might be limited to the &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; lineup because of the processing power required.<br/>
<br/>
All four &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; models are expected to get an A18 chip (perhaps A18 Pro for the Pro lineup), and the A18 chips will be built on Apple's 3-nanometer process for improved performance and efficiency. Right now, the &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; models use the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/3nm/">3nm</a> A17 Pro, but the &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; models are using prior-generation A16 chip technology.<br/>
<br/>
Upgrading to a 3-nanometer chip across the &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; lineup will allow Apple to bring the latest AI features to even its most affordable flagship models, and the A18 is expected to include a faster Neural Engine with "significantly" more cores. Rumors suggest that Apple wants to do AI processing on-device to preserve privacy, and some serious performance is needed to make that possible.<br/>
