		<description><![CDATA[<a href="https://milacares.com/">Mila</a>, a company that makes air purifiers and humidifiers, today announced the launch of the Mila Air 3, an air purifier that offers <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/homekit/">HomeKit</a> integration.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/mila-air-3.jpg" alt="" width="2174" height="1223" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-929704" /><br/>
The Mila Air 3 is an upgrade over the first-generation Mila Air Purifier. Along with &zwnj;HomeKit&zwnj; support, the updated model includes a quieter, more energy efficient fan and more powerful performance thanks to an updated motor. An LCD display provides feedback on air quality, and capacitive buttons allow for on-device control. <br/>
<br/>
With &zwnj;HomeKit&zwnj; integration, the Mila Air 3 will work with the Home app on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>, and Mac, and it will allow the air purifier to be turned on or adjusted with <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a> voice commands.<br/>
<br/>
Mila Air Purifiers work with a new Mila Insights app, providing details on air quality alerts, air quality over time both indoors and outdoors, and the filtering performance of the Mila.<br/>
<br/>
The Mila Air 3 is set to launch in the summer of 2024. Depending on the filter selection, pricing will be &#36;408 to &#36;448, though it will drop to &#36;349 for users who subscribe to an auto-refill service for filters.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ces-2024/">CES 2024</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/10/ces-2024-mila-air-purifier/">CES 2024: Mila Debuts HomeKit-Compatible Smart Air Purifier</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ces-2024-mila-debuts-homekit-compatible-smart-air-purifier.2416024/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today <a href="https://developer.apple.com/safari/download/">released a new update</a> for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/safari-technology-preview/">Safari Technology Preview</a>, the experimental browser Apple <a href="http://www.macrumors.com/2016/03/30/apple-safari-technology-preview-browser/">first introduced</a> in March 2016. Apple designed the &zwnj;Safari Technology Preview&zwnj; to test features that may be introduced into future release versions of Safari.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-785724" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/02/Safari-Technology-Preview-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2368" height="1332" /><br/>
&zwnj;Safari Technology Preview&zwnj; 186 includes fixes and updates for CSS, Forms, HTML, JavaScript, Rendering, Service Workers, Web Animations, and Web API.<br/>
<br/>
The current &zwnj;Safari Technology Preview&zwnj; release is compatible with machines running macOS Ventura and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sonoma/">macOS Sonoma</a>, the latest version of macOS that Apple released in September 2023.<br/>
<br/>
The &zwnj;Safari Technology Preview&zwnj; update is available through the Software Update mechanism in System Preferences or System Settings to anyone who has <a href="https://developer.apple.com/safari/download/">downloaded the browser</a>. Full release notes for the update are available <a href="https://developer.apple.com/safari/technology-preview/release-notes/">on the Safari Technology Preview website</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Apple's aim with &zwnj;Safari Technology Preview&zwnj; is to gather feedback from developers and users on its browser development process. &zwnj;Safari Technology Preview&zwnj; can run side-by-side with the existing Safari browser and while designed for developers, it does not require a developer account to download.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[The U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) today formally opposed Apple's motion for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/21/apple-watch-removed-from-online-store/">Apple Watch sales ban</a> to remain paused for the duration of Apple's appeal.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/09/apple-watch-series-6-blood-oxygen-monitoring-1.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="897" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-759072" /><br/>
In a document filed with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, ITC lawyers said "Apple presents a weak and unconvincing case to invoke the extraordinary remedy of a stay pending appeal," adding that Apple's arguments "amount to little more than an indisputably adjudicated infringer requesting permission to continue infringing the asserted patents."<br/>
<br/>
The court is accepting responses from other parties in support of the ITC's ruling until January 15, so the Apple Watch should remain available until early next week at a minimum.<br/>
<br/>
In October, the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/27/us-trade-tribunal-apple-watch-ban-masimo/">ITC ruled</a> that Apple Watch models with blood oxygen sensing infringed on patents owned by medical technology company Masimo, and ordered that the import and sale of these devices be banned in the U.S. as a result. The feature is available on the Apple Watch Series 6 and newer, excluding Apple Watch SE models.<br/>
<br/>
Masimo has accused Apple of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/18/apple-masimo-legal-battle/">stealing trade secrets and poaching employees</a> to develop its blood oxygen sensing functionality. Last month, Masimo said it was <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/19/masimo-ceo-on-apple-watch-ban/">open to settlement talks</a>, but Apple had reportedly not expressed any interest at the time.<br/>
<br/>
In December, Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/21/apple-watch-removed-from-online-store/">briefly paused sales</a> of the Apple Watch Series 9 and Apple Watch Ultra 2 across its U.S. retail stores and online store. After appealing the ITC's ruling with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, Apple was <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/27/apple-watch-series-9-and-ultra-2-sales-ban-paused/">granted a temporary stay</a>, leading to the ban being paused and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/28/apple-watch-series-9-ultra-2-online/">sales resuming</a> for now.<br/>
<br/>
Apple is reportedly <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/18/apple-watch-import-ban-software-fix/">working on software changes</a> to address the alleged patent infringement, and the U.S. Customs and Border Protection agency is expected to rule on these changes later this week. However, Masimo believes that the Apple Watch's hardware design will have to change to become compliant, and the ITC also expressed skepticism.<br/>
<br/>
"To the extent Apple relies on the soon-expected ruling from Customs and Border Protection ("CBP") as to whether certain redesigned Apple Watches infringe the Asserted Patents, those arguments are, at best, misplaced," ITC lawyers said in today's filing. "A favorable ruling to Apple has no bearing on Apple's alleged likelihood of success on the merits as to any raised issue, and instead would undermine Apple's 'irreparable harm' argument."<br/>
<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Sennheiser <a href="https://newsroom.sennheiser.com/sennheiser-triples-down-at-ces-24">this week announced</a> the launch of several new wire-free earbud and headphone options that are designed to compete with the AirPods and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/">AirPods Pro</a> from Apple.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/sennheiser-sport-earbuds.jpg" alt="" width="1701" height="957" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-929907" /><br/>
The Momentum Sport earbuds are fitness optimized, featuring both a heart rate sensor and a body temperature sensor that can provide real-time biometric feedback. The heart rate data can be added to the Health app on an Apple device, and the earbuds also integrate with other platforms like Strava, Garmin, Peloton, and Polar.<br/>
<br/>
There is a built-in acoustic relief channel that is meant to minimize footstep noise, breathing, and other sounds from the body, and there is a semi-open design that promotes natural environmental awareness that's important for running, biking, and similar activities.<br/>
<br/>
Several listening modes are available, including a Transparency mode, an anti-wind mode, and an Adaptive Noise Canceling mode, so users can adapt the earbuds to multiple activities. The earbuds include a new acoustic system for what Sennheiser says is the best sound yet in a sport earbud, and there is IP55 sweat and water resistance along with a shock-proof chassis. Priced at &#36;330, the Momentum Sport will be available starting on April 9.<br/>
<br/>
The mid-range Accentum Plus headphones are an affordable option that supports aptX and offers 50 hours of listening time on a single charge. The headphones include Adaptive ANC to cut down on ambient sound, and an audio cable allows them to be used in situations where wire-free functionality is not available, such as on an airplane. The Accentum Plus will launch on February 20 and will be priced at &#36;230 in the U.S.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/sennheiser-headphones.jpg" alt="" width="1307" height="735" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-930049" /><br/>
Sennheiser's Momentum True Wireless 4 earbuds are built on Qualcomm's S5 Sound Gen 2 platform with aptX lossless sound quality and low latency. Bluetooth 5.4 is included, as is Auracast, which Sennheiser says offers "exceptional signal continuity while on the go."<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/sennheiser-momentum.jpg" alt="" width="1893" height="1065" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-930050" /><br/>
Adaptive ANC has been improved, plus there is a more advanced tuning system and an upgraded battery system allowing the earbuds to last for up to 7.5 hours before needing to be recharged. The Momentum True Wireless 4 earbuds will be available for pre-order on February 15, and they will be priced at &#36;300 in the United States.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/sennheiser/">Sennheiser</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ces-2024/">CES 2024</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/10/ces-2024-sennheiser/">CES 2024: Sennheiser&#039;s New Wireless Earbuds Feature Heart Rate and Body Temperature Sensors</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ces-2024-sennheisers-new-wireless-earbuds-feature-heart-rate-and-body-temperature-sensors.2416018/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

The Voyage 2-in-1 is a Qi2 wireless charger that supports the latest wireless charging standard.

<br/>
Native Union's (Re)Classic Power Bank features a 5,000mAh battery to add additional power to an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;. The ultra slim power bank is able to connect magnetically to an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; that supports &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; for charging on the go.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple currently offers two external displays, including the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/studio-display/">Studio Display</a> and the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/displays/">Pro Display XDR</a>. It also sells the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/">24-inch iMac</a> for customers who prefer an all-in-one desktop computer, but the larger 27-inch iMac was discontinued in March 2022.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/hero-banner-displays.jpg" alt="" width="1723" height="969" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-930094" /><br/>
Below, we recap rumors about next-generation Studio Display and Pro Display XDR models, as well as a potential 32-inch iMac.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Studio Display</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/hero-banner-displays-studio-display.jpg" alt="" width="1723" height="969" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-930099" /><br/>
Apple released the Studio Display in March 2022 alongside the first Mac Studio. The monitor features a 27-inch LCD screen with 5K resolution, a 60Hz refresh rate, P3 wide color, up to 600 nits brightness, a built-in camera and speakers, one Thunderbolt 3 port, and three USB-C ports. In the U.S., the Studio Display starts at &#36;1,599.<br/>
<br/>
There haven't been any specific rumors about a new Studio Display. However, in December 2022, <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman said Apple was <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/12/18/updated-pro-display-xdr-gurman/">working on multiple new external monitors</a>. He said at least one of these monitors <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/07/03/gurman-apple-monitor-smart-home-display/">could function as a smart home hub</a> in a low-power state, but it's unclear which model he was referring to. In July 2023, Gurman said Apple's next-generation monitors would launch in 2024 at the very earliest.<br/>
<br/>
There have been <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/10/apple-27-inch-mini-led-display-cancelled/">on-again, off-again rumors</a> about Apple planning a new 27-inch external display with mini-LED backlighting and ProMotion support, which could allow for up to a 120Hz refresh rate, but the status of this project is not entirely clear. In April 2023, Apple supply chain analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said the display was <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/11/kuo-apple-27-inch-mini-led-display-still-planned/">slated for mass production in 2024 or early 2025</a>. It's unclear if this monitor would be the next Studio Display.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Pro Display XDR</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/Pro-Display-XDR-Gray.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="840" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-930101" /><br/>
Released in December 2019 alongside an updated Mac Pro, the high-end Pro Display XDR features a 32-inch screen with LED backlighting, a 6K resolution, a 60Hz refresh rate, P3 wide color, up to 1,600 nits of brightness, one Thunderbolt 3 port, and three USB-C ports. In the U.S., the monitor starts at &#36;4,999, but the optional Pro Stand costs &#36;999 extra.<br/>
<br/>
Gurman said one of the new external monitors that Apple was working on was an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/12/18/updated-pro-display-xdr-gurman/">updated version of the Pro Display XDR</a> with an Apple silicon chip, something the current model lacks. In the Studio Display, an A13 Bionic chip powers features such as Center Stage camera framing, spatial audio, and Siri voice commands.<br/>
<br/>
While no other features have been rumored yet, some additions that customers are hoping for include a webcam, speakers, and a higher refresh rate.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>32-Inch iMac</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/iMac-24-Apple-Newsroom-Gray-bg.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-930105" /><br/>
In October 2023, both Gurman and Apple supply chain analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said Apple was <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/23/new-32-inch-imac-pro-expected-2024-or-2025/">developing a 32-inch iMac</a> for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/17/32-inch-imac-coming-in-2025/">release in late 2024 or in 2025</a>. Kuo said the larger iMac's screen would feature mini-LED backlighting.<br/>
<br/>
In November 2023, Apple announced that it has <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/06/no-27-inch-with-apple-silicon/">no plans to release a 27-inch iMac with an Apple silicon chip</a>. For customers who want a large-screened desktop setup, Apple recommended pairing the Studio Display with a Mac Studio or Mac mini. Apple did not explicitly rule out the possibility of a 32-inch iMac being released in the future.<br/>
<br/>
Apple updated the 24-inch iMac <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/30/apple-announces-imac-with-m3-chip/">with its latest M3 chip</a> last year.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/displays/">Apple Pro Display XDR</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/studio-display/">Apple Studio Display</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/mac-accessories.77">Mac Accessories</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/10/studio-display-pro-display-xdr-rumors/">What to Expect From Apple&#039;s Next Studio Display and Pro Display XDR</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/what-to-expect-from-apples-next-studio-display-and-pro-display-xdr.2416008/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Scosche at CES <a href="https://www.scosche.com/ces-2024">is showing off</a> a new version of its BaseLynx 2.0 Modular Charging System, with the updated model offering support for the new Qi2 wireless charging standard.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/scoche-baselynx-qi2.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="562" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-929904" /><br/>
A <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe-battery-pack/">MagSafe</a> version of the BaseLynx 2.0 <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/01/04/scosche-baselynx-charging-system/">launched in Apple retail stores</a> earlier this year, but the new model will be available directly from Scosche as of this spring.<br/>
<br/>
The BaseLynx is a multi-component charging system with modules that include a 2-in-1 Qi2 charger that works with the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> and AirPods, an Apple Watch Stand with fast charging support, a multi-device vertical charging station that provides 60W for up to three devices, and an end cap with an AC outlet and 67W USB-C port. The Qi2 wireless charging base is able to charge an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; at up to 15W, the same as &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
With all of the BaseLynx components, the setup can charge an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;, AirPods, Apple Watch, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>, MacBook, and more all at one time in one organized spot on a desktop.<br/>
<br/>
Alongside the BaseLynx 2.0, <a href="https://www.scosche.com/ces-2024">Scosche also introduced</a> the PowerVolt 150W USB-C Desk Charger With 4 USB-C ports, the PowerVolt 30W USB-C Home Charger, and the PowerVolt 40W USB-C Car Adapter able to provide 20W per USB-C port.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today seeded the third public beta of an upcoming <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sonoma/">macOS Sonoma</a> 14.3 update, allowing non-developers to test out the software ahead of its release. The third public beta comes a week after <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/04/apple-releases-macos-sonoma-14-3-public-beta-2/">the second public beta</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-900182" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/macos-sonoma-4.jpg" alt="" width="2336" height="1314" /><br/>
Beta testers can opt-in through the Software Update section of the System Settings app. Under Beta updates, simply toggle on the Sonoma Public Beta. Note that you must sign up to participate on Apple's <a href="https://beta.apple.com">beta testing website</a>.<br/>
<br/>
&zwnj;macOS Sonoma&zwnj; 14.3 includes support for collaborative playlists in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/">Apple Music</a>, allowing &zwnj;Apple Music&zwnj; subscribers to build playlists with others. When creating a new playlist or selecting an existing playlist, there's a person-shaped icon that can be clicked to turn on collaboration.<br/>
<br/>
Enabling collaboration provides a link that can be shared with others, and anyone with the link is able to contribute to the playlist and listen to the songs. The person who started the playlist can choose to approve those who want to join or open it up to everyone. Anyone with the link to a playlist can add music, though the owner can turn off collaboration at any time or remove people.<br/>
<br/>
&zwnj;macOS Sonoma&zwnj; 14.3 is expected to see a launch later in January.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sonoma/">macOS Sonoma</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macos-sonoma.243">macOS Sonoma</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/10/apple-seeds-macos-sonoma-14-3-public-beta-3/">Apple Seeds Third Public Beta of macOS Sonoma 14.3</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-seeds-third-public-beta-of-macos-sonoma-14-3.2415992/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today seeded the third betas of upcoming iOS 17.3 and iPadOS 17.3 updates to public beta testers, allowing non-developers to test the software ahead of its release. The second public iOS 17.3 and iPadOS 17.3 betas come almost a month after Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/14/apple-seeds-ios-17-3-public-beta-1/">released the first betas</a>. Note that while Apple is calling these the third betas of iOS 17.3 and iPadOS 17.3, there was technically never a second public beta. Apple had to pull the second developer betas of iOS 17.3 and iPadOS 17.3, and opted to go straight to the third beta rather than releasing an updated public beta version.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-926334" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/12/iOS-17.3-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" /><br/>
Public beta testers can get the beta by opening up the Settings app, going to the Software Update section, tapping on the "Beta Updates" option, and toggling on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a> or <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-17/">iPadOS 17</a> Public Beta. Signing up on Apple's beta testing website is required.<br/>
<br/>
iOS 17.3 <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/12/ios-17-3-stolen-device-protection-feature/">includes Stolen Device Protection</a>, a feature that offers an extra layer of security in case your <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> is stolen and the thief also obtains your passcode. With this turned on, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mask-face-id/">Face ID</a> or <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/touch-id/">Touch ID</a> authentication is required for viewing <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/icloud/">iCloud</a> Keychain passwords, turning off Lost Mode, erasing an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;'s contents, using saved payment methods in Safari, and more. There is no passcode entry option should &zwnj;Face ID&zwnj; or &zwnj;Touch ID&zwnj; fail.<br/>
<br/>
Certain actions, such as changing an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-id/">Apple ID</a> password, updating a device passcode, turning off <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/find-my-network-accessory-program/">Find My</a>, and removing &zwnj;Face ID&zwnj; require authentication and also a one-hour security delay.<br/>
<br/>
The update also adds <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/12/ios-17-3-beta-apple-music-collaborative-playlists/">collaborative Apple Music playlists</a>, a feature that lets <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/">Apple Music</a> subscribers build playlists with friends, family members, and others who share their musical tastes. Any playlist can be turned into a collaborative playlist by tapping on the person-shaped icon and sharing the link.<br/>
<br/>
Those who want to try it out in iOS 17.3 can click on <a href="https://music.apple.com/us/playlist/pl.u-kaJH7JG97e?a=join&amp;it=zr6IZVEGZ6tVoblq">the MacRumors playlist link</a> to try adding a song.<br/>
<br/>
We are expecting iOS 17.3 and iPadOS 17.3 to be released sometime in January.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/10/apple-seeds-ios-17-3-public-beta-3/">Apple Seeds Third Public Beta of iOS 17.3 With Stolen Device Protection</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-seeds-third-public-beta-of-ios-17-3-with-stolen-device-protection.2415990/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Images purporting to reveal the original version of Apple's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe-battery-pack/">MagSafe</a> charger today surfaced online, providing a look at how the company conceived of the accessory over two and a half years before its release.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/magsafe-charger-original-prototype.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-929921" /><br/>
The images, shared by the Apple leaker and prototype collector known as "<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/kosutami/">Kosutami</a>," claim to show the original version of the &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; charger that Apple considered launching. The prototype has a production date of March 2017, a key period in the development of Apple's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airpower/">AirPower</a> wireless charging mat. This version of &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; was apparently developed directly alongside &zwnj;AirPower&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
The earlier version of &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> features a rubberized outer shell that feels similar to the base of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod/">HomePod</a>, rounded edges, a different array of magnets with opposite magnetism, and a large Apple logo. It is apparently the same approximate size as the final version, but noticeably thinner. The design language distinctively harks back to an earlier period in Apple's history that more generously used white rubberized plastics and featured its logo more prominently.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Unreleased prototype of MagSafe Charger. It’s super rare yet interesting. Featured different design, magnetic placement, and materials used.<br>Produced around Mar. 2017, which same the AirPower does. Project started over after its cancellation.<br>Infos in last pic. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/appleinternal?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#appleinternal</a> <a href="https://t.co/lxTQqhgk5s">pic.twitter.com/lxTQqhgk5s</a></p>&mdash; Kosutami (@KosutamiSan) <a href="https://twitter.com/KosutamiSan/status/1745026866992624041?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 10, 2024</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div><br/>
<br/>
Following the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2019/03/29/apple-officially-cancels-airpower/">cancelation of AirPower</a> in March 2019, Apple apparently revisited this earlier &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; concept and rebooted the project. It ultimately launched with the design we know today alongside the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 12 in October 2020, seeming to taking direct inspiration from the Apple Watch's charger with a thicker silver aluminum outer shell, flat sides, and no Apple logo.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/10/magsafecasedangle.jpg" alt="" width="3840" height="2160" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-765667" /><em>The ultimately released version of &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; for &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; (2020).</em></div><br/>
<br/>
Kosutami previously shared images of various Apple charger prototypes, including a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/19/prototype-shows-why-apple-abandoned-airpower/">functional AirPower charging mat</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/30/apple-planned-magsafe-charger-color-options/">different color options</a> tested for the &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; charger, and an unreleased <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/14/collectors-discover-unreleased-apple-accessory/">"Magic Charger" accessory</a>. <div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe/">MagSafe</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/prototypes/">Prototypes</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/kosutami/">Kosutami</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/10/magsafe-charger-prototype-reveals-abandoned-design/">MagSafe Charger Prototype Reveals Abandoned 2010s Design</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/magsafe-charger-prototype-reveals-abandoned-2010s-design.2415974/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Google Maps continues to work on integrating Live Activities support for iPhones, according to new assets unearthed by <em>MacRumors</em> contributor Aaron Perris in the latest version of the app.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/02/iphone-14-pro-max-deep-purple-feature-purple.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-886218" /><br/>
Evidence that the feature was in development first appeared in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/28/google-maps-preparing-live-activities/">August</a>, but further work on it had appeared to have come to a standstill until now, suggesting it could become functional soon. <br/>
<br/>
The Google Maps team announced in February 2023 that it would roll out Live Activities support "in the coming months," so support is now long overdue based on the company's own internal roadmap.<br/>
<br/>
When support rolls out, Google Maps users will be able to view turn-by-turn directions and their ETA in a single live-updating <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> Lock Screen notification, as well as in the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/dynamic-island/">Dynamic Island</a> on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-14/">iPhone 14</a> Pro and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a> series models.<br/>
<br/>
Apple opened up its Live Activities API to third-party &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; apps with the release of iOS 16.1, and many developers have <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/live-activities/">since made good use of the feature</a>. <div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/google-maps/">Google Maps</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/live-activities/">Live Activities</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/10/google-maps-live-activities-support-continues/">Google Maps Still Working On Long-Overdue Live Activities Support</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/google-maps-still-working-on-long-overdue-live-activities-support.2415972/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[<a href="https://www.ugreen.com">Ugreen</a>, best known for its charging solutions and accessories, has announced a new partnership with Intel to bring its next-generation NASync series of network attached storage devices to the U.S. market later this year.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/ugreen-nas.jpg" alt="" width="5000" height="2900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-929911" /><br/>
Designed for home or business users, NASync devices use Intel Core i5 control chips to power an AI-driven intelligent data management center where users can store and access data locally and remotely via smartphones, laptops, tablets, and TVs. An all-in-one app facilitates wireless data access for streaming media, and also includes photo recognition for searching pictures by text.<br/>
<br/>
The NASync series come in 2-bay and 4-bay models for home use, and 6-bay and 8-bay models for business, offering up to 184TB of storage capacity and up to 32GB of DDR5 memory. Drive installation is also made easier thanks to what Ugreen calls a unique manual push-pull mechanism, so no additional tools are required.<br/>
<br/>
In addition to the SATA drive bays, all the NASync devices in the range include at least two M.2 SSD drive slots for installing solid-state drives, which can be used for extra storage or as a fast caching space for speeding up read/write performance.<br/>
<br/>
Each NAS is equipped with dual Thunderbolt 4 Ports, an SD slot, USB-A ports and Type-C ports, and HDMI for up to 8K output, allowing NASync to be connected to various storage devices such as SD cards, mobile hard disks, USB flash drives, and disk array cabinets for data back-up and synchronization. In addition, the NASync Series is also equipped with a PCIe 4.0 X4 expansion slot and dual 10GB Ethernet ports that can be aggregated into a 20GB bandwidth, offering up to 2,500MB/s download speeds. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/ugreen-nasync.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-929914" /><br/>
Ugreen is also launching an "all-flash" compact model for creative and media professionals that features four M.2 SSD drive slots, an 8K HDMI port, and a built-in Wi-Fi chip.<br/>
<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple has <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/08/apple-announces-february-2-vision-pro-launch/">announced</a> the launch date of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a>, its much-touted spatial computing device. The mixed reality headset starts at &#36;3,499 and will go on sale in the U.S. on Friday, February 2, with availability in Canada and the United Kingdom expected to follow later this year.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/Apple-Vision-Pro-Dual-Loop-Band.jpeg" alt="" width="1640" height="1060" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-929483" /><br/>
Apple has not yet revealed all the details about the device's configuration options ahead of pre-orders, which start on Friday, January 19, but we do know what is included in the box with every &zwnj;Apple Vision Pro&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
<ul><br/>
    <li><strong>Vision Pro Headset</strong>: The headset is the primary component of the Vision Pro system, featuring advanced eye and hand-tracking technology via cameras, ultra high-resolution displays for each eye, speakers on either side, and an EyeSight front-facing screen. The headset comes with a minimum of 256GB of onboard storage for applications and media.</li><br/>
    <li><strong>Solo Knit Band and Dual Loop Band</strong>: These two types of headband are designed for user comfort and customization. The Solo Knit Band is a single band that wraps around the back of the head, while Apple says the Dual Loop Band features "a pair of adjustable upper and lower straps for a personalized fit."</li><br/>
    <li><strong>Light Seal</strong>: The Light Seal is made of a soft textile and likely comes in a range of shapes and sizes, flexing to conform to the user's face for a precise fit. This accessory helps to block external light, enhancing the immersive experience of the headset.</li><br/>
    <li><strong>Two Light Seal Cushions</strong>: These cushions come supplied in two sizes and provide additional comfort and light-blocking capability, ensuring a snug fit around the face to prevent light leakage.</li><br/>
    <li><strong>Cover for Front Glass</strong>: The cover protects the headset's front glass when not in use, preventing scratches and damage.</li><br/>
    <li><strong>Polishing Cloth</strong>: A soft cloth designed for cleaning the headset's lenses and front glass without causing scratches or damage.</li><br/>
    <li><strong>Battery Pack</strong>: An external power source for the headset, ensuring longer usage times and portability. The battery provides 2 hours of general use and 2.5 hours of 2D video playback on a single charge, according to Apple.</li><br/>
    <li><strong>USB-C Power Adapter</strong>: The adapter is used to charge the headset's battery pack, ensuring the device is always ready for use. It also may enable the Vision Pro to be connected to an external power source for longer periods of use than the portable battery allows, although Apple has yet to confirm this.</li><br/>
    <li><strong>USB-C Charging Cable</strong>: A cable for connecting the headset or the battery pack to the USB-C power adapter for charging.</li><br/>
</ul><br/>
<br/>
Apple will offer optional optical inserts for users who normally wear glasses, but these are not included in the packaging and will be a separate purchase starting at &#36;99. Apple is partnering with ZEISS to offer the inserts that can be customized to each person's vision requirements. <br/>
<br/>
The inserts attach to the Vision Pro lenses magnetically, allowing for precise viewing and eye tracking. Glasses wearers will need a valid prescription to get the inserts, but Apple cautions that not all prescriptions will be supported. Optical inserts will be available to order online on Apple's website.<br/>
<br/>
Apple plans to start offering Vision Pro demonstrations at U.S. Apple retail stores on launch day. Apple says that demo times will be offered through the weekend on a first-come, first-served basis, with signups to take place starting at 8:00 a.m. on February 2.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[<a href="https://www.otterbox.com/">OtterBox</a>, known for its range of protective cases designed for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>, today announced the launch of new cases that are made from cactus leather. According to OtterBox, the cases are designed to feel like leather, but are created from the more sustainable and ethical cactus material.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/otterbox-cactus-leather-case.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-929892" /><br/>
The soft-touch Symmetry Series Cactus Leather Cases offer the case protection that is typical of an OtterBox accessory. There's a rigid case design with reinforced corners for shock absorption, a raised edge to keep the camera safe, a screen lip to protect the display, and DROP+ protection.<br/>
<br/>
The cactus leather is sourced from the nopal cactus, which is more commonly known as the prickly pear. Producing cactus leather requires less land, water, and resources than producing traditional leather, and when mature prickly pear pads are gathered, the rest of the cactus remains alive and healthy for re-harvesting again in the future.<br/>
<br/>
<em>MacRumors</em> videographer Dan Barbera was able to see OtterBox's cases in person at CES, and he found the material to be an improvement over Apple's leather alternative, FineWoven.<br/>
<br/>
OtterBox is offering the cases alongside cactus leather Apple Watch band options and a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe-battery-pack/">MagSafe</a> wallet made from the same material.<br/>
<br/>
The first cactus leather cases will be priced at &#36;60 and will be <a href="https://www.otterbox.com/">available from the OtterBox website</a> starting in Spring 2024.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/otterbox/">OtterBox</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ces-2024/">CES 2024</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/09/ces-2024-otterbox/">CES 2024: OtterBox Launches New Cases Made From Sustainable Cactus Leather</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ces-2024-otterbox-launches-new-cases-made-from-sustainable-cactus-leather.2415926/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[AI startup Rabbit today announced the launch of <a href="https://www.rabbit.tech">the Rabbit r1</a>, a mobile device that's designed to simplify the experience of using a smartphone. The r1 runs rabbit OS, an operating system powered by a Large Action Model (LAM).<br/>

Rabbit says that the r1 can understand complex user intentions, operate user interfaces, and perform actions on behalf of the user. The OS was trained on data from people interacting with apps, allowing the r1 to do tasks like ordering pizza, booking ride services, playing music, communicating with people, and more, through voice commands.<br/>
<br/>

Watch the keynote. <br><br>Order now: <a href="https://t.co/R3sOtVWoJ5">https://t.co/R3sOtVWoJ5</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/CES2024?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#CES2024</a> <a href="https://t.co/niUmjFvKvE">pic.twitter.com/niUmjFvKvE</a></p>&mdash; rabbit inc.

The Rabbit r1 can be interacted with using a push-to-talk button on the side, and it understands natural language requests. There are no apps on the r1, and tasks are performed over the internet.<br/>
<br/>
Designed in partnership with Teenage Engineering, the r1 has a 2.88-inch touch screen, a camera that rotates for capturing photos and videos and taking video calls, a scroll wheel for navigation purposes, and a USB-C port for charging. There is a 1,000mAh battery, and battery life depends on usage. While there is no subscription associated with the Rabbit r1, it does need a SIM card for cellular data.<br/>
<br/>
Users can teach the r1 to perform tasks, including multi-step tasks such as researching a location, booking a hotel, securing restaurant recommendations, and finding activities. Once the r1 has learned a task, it can repeat the action independently. It supposedly can even interact with apps like Photoshop, performing multi-step actions within the software.<br/>
<br/>
The Rabbit r1 needs to be provided with a user's logins for various services in order to complete tasks involving those services. <br/>
<br/>
The Rabbit r1 can be <a href="https://www.rabbit.tech">pre-ordered from the Rabbit website</a> for &#36;200. It is expected to ship to customers in March or April of 2024<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ces-2024/">CES 2024</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/09/ces-2024-rabbit-r1/">CES 2024: Rabbit r1 AI Assistant Wants to Do Tasks for You</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ces-2024-rabbit-r1-ai-assistant-wants-to-do-tasks-for-you.2415922/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today seeded the third beta of an upcoming tvOS 17.3 update to developers for testing purposes, with the beta coming a week after the release of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/03/apple-seeds-tvos-17-3-beta-2-to-developers/">second tvOS 17.3 beta</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-869857" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/10/Apple-TV-2022-Feature-Blue.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" /><br/>
Registered developers are able to download the tvOS 17.3 update by opting in to the beta through the Settings app on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a>. A registered developer account is required.<br/>
<br/>
tvOS updates are often minor in scale compared to other operating system updates, focusing primarily on bug fixes and smaller improvements rather than notable outward-facing changes. We don't yet know what's included in tvOS 17.3.<br/>
<br/>
Apple shares some information on tvOS releases in its <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207936">tvOS support document</a>, which is updated after each tvOS launch, but Apple does not provide notes during beta testing.<br/>
<br/>
Though we don't always know what's new in tvOS betas, we let <em>MacRumors</em> readers know when new updates are available so those who are developers can download new software upon release.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_TV">Apple TV (Neutral)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-tv-and-home-theater.100">Apple TV and Home Theater</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/09/apple-seeds-tvos-17-3-beta-3-to-developers/">Apple Seeds Third Beta of tvOS 17.3 to Developers</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-seeds-third-beta-of-tvos-17-3-to-developers.2415915/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[CES is underway in Las Vegas, and while it's been overshadowed by Apple's Vision Pro launch date announcement, there are still plenty of interesting new products to look at. <em>MacRumors</em> videographer Dan Barbera is at CES to bring us an overview of what's worth checking out.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TfqEDPHjK5Y" title="CES 2024 Day 2: LG Transparent OLED, Facial Recognition Lock &amp; More!" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe><em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/macrumors?sub_confirmation=1">Subscribe to the MacRumors YouTube channel</a> for more videos.</em></div><br/>
Day 2 at CES was actually Monday, the day before the show "officially" kicks off and the show floor opens. Vendors were on hand showcasing products in private suites, and the annual Pepcom show took place.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/08/ces-2024-day-1-recap/">Like Samsung</a>, LG was showing off transparent display technology with the LG Signature OLED T (T for transparent). LG's OLED TV is coming out later this year, and it can transition between transparency and an opaque background for television watching. LG has designed content specifically for the see-through background, and some of it has an almost hologram-like look.<br/>
<br/>
Lockly was showing off a HomeKit-compatible smart lock that uses facial recognition to open the door, while Ember brought its cup warming technology to baby bottles. Aqara showed off an indoor lock with fingerprint detection, and Scosche was on hand to demo the BaseLynx 2.0, its modular charging system for Apple devices.<br/>
<br/>
OtterBox has a new environmentally friendly <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> case made of cactus leather, Orbi showed off a new Wi-Fi 7 mesh router setup, and GE had an indoor smokeless smoker that uses pellets.<br/>
<br/>
Dan will be wandering the show floor on Tuesday, so make sure to stay tuned to see tomorrow's CES roundup video. We're also covering all kinds of announcements from CES, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ces-2024/">which you can check out at our CES 2024 hub</a>.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ces-2024/">CES 2024</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/09/ces-2024-day-2-recap/">CES 2024 Day 2: Transparent TVs From LG, OtterBox&#039;s Cactus Leather, Lockly Smart Locks and More</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ces-2024-day-2-transparent-tvs-from-lg-otterboxs-cactus-leather-lockly-smart-locks-and-more.2415910/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Today marks the 17th anniversary of the late Steve Jobs <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnrJzXM7a6o">unveiling the original iPhone</a> at the Macworld Expo in San Francisco. While the device was significantly more advanced than any other smartphone on the market at the time, the iPhone was still missing some essential features that we take for granted today.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/2007-iPhone.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="675" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-929882" /><br/>
Below, we've put together a list of 10 hardware and software features that the original iPhone didn't have when it was introduced in January 2007.<br/>
<br/>
<ul><li><strong>Copy and Paste:</strong> It may seem hard to believe, but the ability to copy and paste text was not added to the iPhone until 2009.</li><br/>
<li><strong>Front Camera:</strong> While selfies are now ubiquitous, there was no front camera on the original iPhone. In fact, there was no front camera until the iPhone 4 launched in 2010 with new FaceTime video calling.</li><br/>
<li><strong>App Store:</strong> The original iPhone came with preinstalled apps like Phone, Weather, Notes, Calendar, Photos, and Calculator, but there was no official way to install native third-party apps until the App Store launched in July 2008. Developers were able to offer web-based apps, but they were more limited.</li><br/>
<li><strong>Video Recording:</strong> The original iPhone can only shoot photos, with video recording introduced on the iPhone 3GS in 2009.</li><br/>
<li><strong>Flashlight:</strong> With no LED flash on the original iPhone, there was no built-in flashlight. When the App Store launched, some flashlight apps were released that displayed a white screen at max brightness to mimic a flashlight.</li><br/>
<li><strong>Photo Messages:</strong> The original iPhone supported text messaging via SMS, but there was no ability to send photos. MMS capabilities were introduced with iPhone OS 3.0 in 2009, but only for the iPhone 3G and iPhone 3GS.<br/>
<li><strong>GPS:</strong> While the original iPhone came with a Google Maps app preinstalled, there were no turn-by-turn directions, as the device did not have a GPS. Apple introduced a built-in GPS with the iPhone 3G in 2008.</li><br/>
<li><strong>Home Screen Wallpapers:</strong> It was not possible to set a custom Home Screen wallpaper on the iPhone until iOS 4 was released in 2010, and the software update did not support the original iPhone.</li><br/>
<li><strong>Retina Display:</strong> Introduced on the iPhone 4 in 2010, the Retina display featured four times as many pixels as the original iPhone and was the highest-resolution display for a smartphone ever at the time.</li><br/>
<li><strong>3G:</strong> The original iPhone's cellular connectivity was limited to EDGE (2G).</li></ul><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/09/original-iphone-missing-features/">iPhone Was Missing These 10 Essential Features When Unveiled in 2007</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-was-missing-these-10-essential-features-when-unveiled-in-2007.2415906/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>
