		<description><![CDATA[If you buy a shiny new Vision Pro, be extra careful not to lose it. Unlike the iPhone and many other Apple devices, the headset lacks Find My location tracking.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/Apple-Vision-Pro-Travel-Mode.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-930973" /><br/>
In a new <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT214043">support document</a>, Apple has confirmed that a Vision Pro's location cannot be viewed in the Find My app on another Apple device, or on iCloud.com. Of the Find My family of features, the Vision Pro only supports Activation Lock, which ensures that a thief cannot erase or freshly set up the headset unless they know the owner's Apple ID and password.<br/>
<br/>
"When you turn on Find My, you protect your Vision Pro with Activation Lock — but you can't use another Apple device or the web to find Vision Pro on a map, play a sound to help find it, turn on Lost Mode, or remotely erase it," says Apple.<br/>
<br/>
While it's nice to know that a thief cannot easily erase your Vision Pro and set it up with their own Apple ID, the inability to track its location in the Find My app is a noteworthy omission for a headset that starts at &#36;3,499. It ultimately means that if you lose your Vision Pro, you could be simply out of luck beyond filing a police report. Unlike for the iPhone, there is no AppleCare+ theft and loss plan available for the Vision Pro at this time.<br/>
<br/>
While many people will primarily use the Vision Pro at home as an entertainment device, which will greatly reduce the risk of the headset being stolen, Apple does promote using the Vision Pro on an airplane and other settings away from home. The headset could be especially attractive to thieves given how expensive it is.<br/>
<br/>
It's unclear why the Vision Pro lacks Find My location tracking — perhaps the decision relates to the headset's lack of a built-in battery.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Use an AirTag</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/vision-pro-case-feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-931669" /><br/>
One option for tracking the location of your Vision Pro is to purchase <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/19/apple-releases-vision-pro-accessories/">Apple's travel case</a> and place an AirTag in it, and it is likely that accessory makers will come up with solutions for attaching an AirTag directly to the headset.<br/>
<br/>
Vision Pro owners can also ensure that Activation Lock is turned on by opening the Settings app, selecting Find My, and selecting Find My Vision Pro.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AppleVisionPro">Vision Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-vision-pro.209">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/02/apple-vision-pro-lacks-find-my-tracking/">Don&#039;t Lose Your &#36;3,500 Apple Vision Pro, You Can&#039;t Track Its Location</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/dont-lose-your-3-500-apple-vision-pro-you-cant-track-its-location.2418198/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[If you have an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a>, you're undoubtedly going to get requests from friends and family members who want to give it a try. The headset is primarily designed for a single user because of the customized fit of the Light Seal, but Apple planned for demos with a <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/117742">built-in Guest Mode</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/Apple-WWCD23-Vision-Pro-EyeSight-230605.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-922614" /><br/>
Apple warns that guests might not be able to get an optimal fit, but <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/117730">Apple recommends</a> having the person test both the Solo Knit and Dual Loop Bands. Apple suggests that guests should have their own personalized Light Seal, but Light Seals are priced at &#36;200, so that's quite a steep add-on cost.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/O-OTFLEmF5Q" title="How to share your Apple Vision Pro with Guest User | Apple Support" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><br/>
Guests can try Vision Pro with a customizable Guest User section. Apple says that to limit access to apps, a passcode should be set. Apps that you don't want the guest to use should be closed, and apps you want to demo should be opened.<br/>
<h2>How to Start a Guest User Session</h2><br/>
<ol><br/>
 	<li>Open the Control Center by looking up and tapping the down button at the top of the view.</li><br/>
 	<li>Tap on the Control Center button to open up more options.</li><br/>
 	<li>Tap on the Guest User button.</li><br/>
 	<li>Tap Allowed Apps under the Guest User window. Select from Open Apps Only to limit access, or All Apps &amp; Data for unrestricted access.</li><br/>
 	<li>Tap on the back button, and then tap on Start. You'll get a notification that you have five minutes to hand the headset over to the guest user. If you don't hand it over within five minutes, Guest User turns off and the Vision Pro locks.</li><br/>
</ol><br/>
Apple says that if you tap on View Mirroring while in the Control Center, you can see what your guest is seeing on Vision Pro on one of your other Apple devices.<br/>
<br/>
You will need to walk your guest through using Vision Pro, and they may need to press and hold on the Digital Crown until the displays align and a green checkmark appears. A hand and eye setup will follow so the Vision Pro responds appropriately.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>How to End a Guest User Session</h2><br/>
To end a Guest User session, the guest simply needs to remove the Vision Pro. The next time you wear your Vision Pro, it will return to your personal hand and eye settings.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Guest User Options</h2><br/>
During a Vision Pro Guest session, a guest can access all apps and data or just the apps you've allowed. Any open app will have full access, so if you open <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/photos/">Photos</a>, they can see your images, or in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/">Apple Music</a>, they can listen to your content.<br/>
<br/>
Guests will not have access to your <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-id/">Apple ID</a>, Persona, or Wallet &amp; <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-pay/">Apple Pay</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Guests do have access to a selection of settings such as accessibility, an option to redo eye and hand setup, and an option to learn more about the Guest User experience.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/visionos/">visionOS</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AppleVisionPro">Vision Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-vision-pro.209">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/use-vision-pro-guest-mode/">Here&#039;s How to Let Someone Else Try Your Apple Vision Pro</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/heres-how-to-let-someone-else-try-your-apple-vision-pro.2418178/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[On this week's episode of <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/march-apple-event-rumors-and-ios-18s-biggest-ever-update/id1602394741?i=1000643961912">The MacRumors Show</a>, we discuss Apple's potential March event to unveil <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/28/gurman-new-ipads-and-macs-in-late-march/">new iPad and Mac models</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a> as the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/28/ios-18-big-expectations/">"biggest" ever</a> <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> software update, and the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/review/apple-vision-pro/">first reviews</a> of the Vision Pro headset.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Z2o4HR10xrs?si=gZNSDA7DN88IRpQQ" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe><em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@themacrumorsshow?sub_confirmation=1">Subscribe to The MacRumors Show YouTube channel</a> for more videos</em></div><br/>
We explore the major products Apple is expected to unveil in March, including a new 12.9-inch <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/">iPad Air</a> model, redesigned <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> Pros with OLED displays, and refreshed <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/">MacBook Air</a> models featuring the M3 chip, as well as some of the rumored accessories due to arrive at the same time, such as an all-new, "laptop-like" Magic Keyboard for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a>. We consider whether Apple will opt for a fully fledged event, or a simple series of press releases to announce these updates. We also discuss &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj;, musing about some of the potential redesigns and improvements that could be in store for the software update.<br/>
<br/>
Following the release of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/review/apple-vision-pro/">first reviews</a> of Apple's Vision Pro headset, we dissect the varying reactions to the device, examining its form factor, user experience, and the unique approach Apple has taken to mitigate the traditionally insular experience of VR/AR headsets. We address some of the limitations currently faced by headsets, such as the absence of a direct touch experience, the market's apparent skepticism towards the device, and where it could go next.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Following the launch of the Vision Pro, Apple has published a number of support documents on how to use the device and what to do if motion sickness or discomfort is experienced when wearing the headset.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/Apple-Vision-Pro-Dual-Loop-Band-Orange-Feature-2.jpg" alt="" width="1960" height="1102" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-929937" /><br/>
<h2>Visual Discomfort</h2><br/>
Vision Pro users who <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT213946">experience visual discomfort</a> such as blurry vision, double vision, dry eyes, watery eyes, light sensitivity, and eye strain should stop using Vision Pro and wait for symptoms to resolve.<br/>
<br/>
To minimize visual discomfort, Apple says that a good fit is essential, with pressure balanced across the nose and cheeks and the proper alignment set up. Vision Pro should be used in short increments of time to start with, and Apple recommends regular breaks every 20 to 30 minutes.<br/>
<br/>
Apple also says that keeping the head upright rather than tilted to one side or another and sitting upright while watching 3D movies, immersive media, or spatial video can help.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Alignment</h2><br/>
Vision Pro was designed to "accommodate a range" of inter-pupillary distances, but Apple says that some people who fall outside of this range could experience visual discomfort using the headset.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Safety Recommendations</h2><br/>
Apple recommends that people <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/19/vision-pro-medical-conditions/">with certain conditions</a> use caution when using Vision Pro.<br/>
<br/>
The headset <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT213944">should be used</a> in a "controlled" indoor or outdoor space that is free of obstacles that could be tripped over or hit with hands. Apple warns that doorknobs and cabinets could catch the power cable and cause it to disconnect.<br/>
<br/>
Vision Pro should not be used in extreme temperatures, rain, fog, or moisture of any kind, and water damage is not covered under the warranty. Vision Pro should also be used in a well-lit area for the best experience, as low-light conditions can increase the risk of object collisions. <br/>
<br/>
<h2>Battery</h2><br/>
The Vision Pro battery should be kept in a well-ventilated area so that it does not get excessively warm.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Motion Sickness</h2><br/>
A "small number of people" <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT213934">may experience motion sickness</a> when using Vision Pro. Symptoms include dizziness, nausea, decreased awareness, upset stomach, increased salivation, headache, fatigue, and sweating. Apple says that it can take up to 30 minutes for symptoms to start.<br/>
<br/>
Those experiencing motion sickness should stop using the headset, and should not use Vision Pro while on an airplane. Using the device for short increments of time and with less immersive experiences can help.<br/>
<br/>
To minimize motion sickness, Apple says that users should reduce head motion and move the head and neck as little as possible. Apple also recommends reducing visual motion by decreasing window sizes, reducing the level of immersion, and turning on the Reduce Motion setting in the Accessibility section of Settings.<br/>
<br/>
High motion experiences like Apple Immersive Media should also be avoided by those who get motion sick, as should spatial video with a lot of movement.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/visionos/">visionOS</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AppleVisionPro">Vision Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-vision-pro.209">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/02/vision-pro-visual-discomfort/">Apple Details What to Do If Vision Pro Causes Visual Discomfort, Motion Sickness and More</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-details-what-to-do-if-vision-pro-causes-visual-discomfort-motion-sickness-and-more.2418174/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Like the iPhone, the Vision Pro has an always-on battery management system that could lead to reduced performance in certain situations, according to Apple.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/apple-vision-pro-chips.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-898904" /><br/>
In a <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT213955">support document</a> published today, Apple said Vision Pro users could notice impacts such as longer app launch times, lower frame rates, reduced wireless speeds, screen dimming, or lower speaker volume in situations where the Vision Pro is low on battery, has a chemically aged battery, or is in a peak-power state.<br/>
<br/>
Apple's full explanation:<blockquote>Apple Vision Pro has built-in software and hardware systems that help reduce performance impacts that may be noticed in certain conditions such as a battery with a low state of charge, a high peak power situation, or a chemically aged battery. The system is automatic, always-on, and works to provide the best possible performance. Power needs are dynamically monitored, and performance is managed to address these needs in real time. The system allows Apple Vision Pro to balance and reduce performance impacts as much as possible. The user may or may not notice effects on device, which may be temporary. Depending on the device battery state and the tasks that your Apple Vision Pro is handling, some examples of these effects may include longer app launch times, lower frame rates, reduced wireless data throughput, screen dimming, or lower speaker volume.</blockquote>Apple introduced a similar system on older iPhone models back in 2017, but it failed to mention the system in its iOS release notes at the time, leading to a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone-slowdown/">major controversy</a>. Apple eventually <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/06/apple-starts-iphone-batterygate-payouts/">agreed to pay up to &#36;500 million</a> to settle a class action lawsuit that accused the company of "secretly throttling" some iPhone models.<br/>
<br/>
Nowadays, the system is considered by many to be a helpful feature that ensures smooth performance and prevents unexpected shutdowns.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AppleVisionPro">Vision Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-vision-pro.209">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/02/vision-pro-battery-management-system/">Apple Says Vision Pro Performance Could Be Reduced in Some Situations</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-says-vision-pro-performance-could-be-reduced-in-some-situations.2418173/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today shared a detailed <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT213964">support document</a> explaining how to clean the Vision Pro headset and all of its accompanying components.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/Apple-Vision-Pro-Dual-Loop-Band-Purple-Feature-2.jpg" alt="" width="1960" height="1102" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-929938" /><br/>
Apple warns that disinfectants like isopropyl alcohol, Windex, and Clorox should not be used to clean the Vision Pro. Instead, users should simply use a dry or slightly damp cloth.<br/>
<br/>
To clean the cover glass of the Vision Pro, Apple simply encourages use of a clean, dry microfiber cloth like the polishing cloth included with the headset. If necessary, users can also spray ZEISS cleaning fluid on the cloth before wiping the Vision Pro.<br/>
<br/>
Apple warns that its polishing cloth may attract particles that could scratch the Vision Pro if it is stored loose in a backpack, handbag, or pockets, and suggests that it should be stored in a clean bag. The polishing cloth can be machine washed and dried, or washed by hand, as needed to ensure it is clean enough to wipe the headset.<br/>
<br/>
To clean the inner displays, Apple says that users should first put the Vision Pro's cover on and put the headset on a level surface. Then, wipe the optical displays with a microfiber cloth, using ZEISS cleaning spray if required.<br/>
<br/>
ZEISS Optical Inserts should be removed from the Vision Pro before cleaning them. They can be cleaned with ZEISS Lens Wipes, ZEISS Cleaning Spray, or lukewarm water, and should be fully dry before being reattached to the headset.<br/>
<br/>
Users should use a lint-free cloth, soft bristle brush, or non-tacky tape to remove debris stuck to the curtain around the displays. Stains in this area can be removed by rubbing them with a damp cloth, but care should be taken to avoid getting the displays wet.<br/>
<br/>
To clean the Light Seal, Light Seal Cushion, head bands, and cover, users can use fragrance-free unscented dish soap, but cleaning wipes, disinfectant wipes, and laundry detergent should be avoided. 5 tsp (25 ml) of fragrance-free dish soap should be mixed into two cups (500 ml) of warm water in a clean container, before submersing the Light Seal, Light Seal Cushion, head band, or cover into the liquid and gently rubbing the surface for around two minutes. The item should then be removed and rinsed under running water while compressing it to remove any excess soap, before leaving it to dry at room temperature. It should not be used until it is completely dry. <br/>
<br/>
The Audio Straps should be cleaned with a lint-free cloth. It can be lightly dampened with water and hypoallergenic soap, as long as the microphone, speakers, power connector, head band connector, and aluminum lid are avoided. It should be dried with a cloth before being attached to the main system. The speaker meshes can be cleaned with a dry cotton swab.<br/>
<br/>
The battery can be cleaned with a damp lint-free cloth once it is disconnected, avoiding getting any moisture near the power cable connector. To clean the power cable itself, a cloth dampened with soapy water can be used. It should be left to dry overnight before using it again with the Vision Pro.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AppleVisionPro">Vision Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-vision-pro.209">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/02/apple-explains-how-to-clean-vision-pro-headset/">Apple Explains How to Clean Vision Pro Headset</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-explains-how-to-clean-vision-pro-headset.2418172/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<title>Apple Says Vision Pro Syncs Data When Not in Use, Explains Battery Light Charge Indicator</title>

		<description><![CDATA[Now that <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a> has launched in the U.S., Apple has released additional support documentation for the device, including <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/117740">how to connect and charge the Vision Pro battery</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/vision-pro-battery-pack.jpg" alt="" width="1640" height="1060" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-929544" /><br/>
Notably, Apple's document reveals that the external battery also powers &zwnj;Apple Vision Pro&zwnj; when you're not wearing it, allowing the device to sync your mail, photos, and more. If the headset isn't worn for 24 hours though, it turns off automatically. <br/>
<blockquote>To check if Apple Vision Pro is still powered on when you're not wearing it, pick up the device. If it's powered on, the light on the power cable will turn on briefly. If Apple Vision Pro has turned off, press and hold the top button for three seconds to turn it back on. After about a minute, Apple Vision Pro makes a tone that means it's ready to use, and the light on the power cable will be solid.</blockquote>Apple recommends disconnecting the battery if you know in advance that you won't be using the headset for an extended length of time. To disconnect the battery from &zwnj;Apple Vision Pro&zwnj;, users are advised to first save any open documents — since disconnecting the battery turns off the device — then turn the power cable counterclockwise until it detaches.<br/>
<br/>
Additionally, Apple outlines what the battery's light tells users about its charge level when it is first connected to power, or moved or tapped while charging:<br/>
<ul><li><strong>Green for several seconds</strong>: the battery is charged to capacity.</li><br/>
<li><strong>Amber for several seconds</strong>: the battery's charge level is less than 100%, but has enough charge for you to use &zwnj;Apple Vision Pro&zwnj;.</li><br/>
<li><strong>Amber pulsing slowly</strong>: the battery's charge level is too low to power your &zwnj;Apple Vision Pro&zwnj;. Keep charging the battery for 10 minutes, or until the light shows amber steadily (not pulsing) when you tap the battery.</li></ul>Apple also explains what the battery light's color changes mean when users disconnect it from power, or moved or tapped when it's not charging:<br/>
<ul><li><strong>Green for several seconds</strong>: the battery is charged to 50% or higher.</li><br/>
<li><strong>Amber for several seconds</strong>: the battery's charge level is between 1% and 49%.</li><br/>
<li><strong>Amber pulsing slowly</strong>: the battery's charge level is too low to power your &zwnj;Apple Vision Pro&zwnj;. Charge the battery for 10 minutes, or until the light shows amber steadily (not pulsing) when you tap the battery.</li></ul>Apple also cautions users not to sit down with the battery in their back pocket, pull the battery off a desk when standing up, or let it fall between seats on an airplane.<br/>
<br/>
According to Apple, Vision Pro batteries can be used for up to 2 hours of general use or 2.5 hours of 2D video watching when fully charged, or all day when connected to power. Apple sells additional Vision Pro battery packs for &#36;200 a piece, but they are <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/31/apple-vision-pro-battery-not-hot-swappable/">not hot-swappable</a>. <div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AppleVisionPro">Vision Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-vision-pro.209">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/02/apple-vision-pro-syncs-data-battery-light/">Apple Says Vision Pro Syncs Data When Not in Use, Explains Battery Light Charge Indicator</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-says-vision-pro-syncs-data-when-not-in-use-explains-battery-light-charge-indicator.2418170/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

Four of the videos provide an overview of the Settings app, Control Center, Guest User mode, and accessibility features on visionOS. Other videos explain how to set up ZEISS optical inserts for the Vision Pro, how to turn on the Vision Pro, and how to capture spatial video on the iPhone 15 Pro for playback on the Vision Pro.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Amazon today has the Apple Watch Ultra 2 for a new all-time low price of <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0CHX7J5Z3%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"><strong>&#36;737.99</strong></a>, down from &#36;799.00. This deal is only available in the Indigo Alpine Loop (Medium) configuration, and only Amazon has this deal.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/Apple-Watch-Series-9-and-Ultra-2-Deals-2.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-913210" /><em><small>Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with some of these vendors. When you click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment, which helps us keep the site running.</small></em><br/>
<br/>
If you have your eye on other models, there are quite a few more deals on the Apple Watch Ultra 2 at <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0CHX94FRH%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"><strong>&#36;749.00</strong></a>, down from &#36;799.00. This is still a solid second-best price on the wearable, and you'll find it in the Trail Loop and Alpine Loop band styles.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0CHX7J5Z3%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"target="_blank"><div class="fancybutton"><div class="fancybadge">&#36;61 OFF</div>Apple Watch Ultra 2 for &#36;737.99</div></a></div><br/>
<br/>
Apple Watch deals are abundant on Amazon this week, and you can also get the 40mm GPS Apple Watch SE for <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0CHXCXKPD%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"><strong>&#36;199.00</strong></a> and the 44mm GPS model for <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0CHX5W8YM%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"><strong>&#36;229.00</strong></a>, both of which are &#36;50 off and great second-best prices. Likewise, you can get the 41mm GPS Apple Watch Series 9 for <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0CHX1RVMT%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"><strong>&#36;329.00</strong></a> and the 45mm GPS model for <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0CHX6SF1J%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"><strong>&#36;359.00</strong></a>, which are both &#36;70 off and also second-best prices.<br/>
<br/>
As of last month, a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/17/apple-watch-sales-ban-reinstated/">sales ban was reenacted</a> in the United States on any Apple Watch model sold by Apple that has blood oxygen sensing. While Apple Watch Series 9 and Apple Watch Ultra 2 models purchased directly from Apple currently come with blood oxygen sensing disabled, retailers like Amazon are able to continue selling through their existing stocks that include the feature.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today announced that Vision Pro demo appointments at Apple Stores in the U.S. on Monday and later <a href="https://www.apple.com/retail/instore-shopping-session/?topic=visionpro">can be reserved on Apple.com</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/Apple-Vision-Pro-Demo.jpeg" alt="" width="2880" height="1620" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-933882" /><br/>
To reserve a free Vision Pro demo online, go to <a href="https://www.apple.com/retail/instore-shopping-session/?topic=visionpro">this page</a> on Apple's website and follow the steps to book an appointment at your local Apple Store. It is also possible to make a reservation through the latest version of the Apple Store app. Apple will ask you a few questions to get started, including whether you wear prescription eyeglasses or contacts, in order to prepare ZEISS optical inserts for your demo if necessary.<br/>
<br/>
In the meantime, Vision Pro demos are available from today through Sunday at all Apple Stores in the U.S. on a first-come, first-served basis. There is no way to reserve a demo on these days, so you simply need to show up and wait.<br/>
<br/>
"Be one of the first to get a demo of Apple Vision Pro," reads a new banner added to Apple's website today. "We invite you to sign up for a demo at your local Apple Store. Demo times are available on a first-come, first-served basis. For demos on February 5 or later, you can also book an appointment online."<br/>
<br/>
Vision Pro demos will take up to 30 minutes each, including setup time. During the demo, you will learn how to navigate the visionOS operating system, and explore built-in apps such as Apple TV, Photos, and Safari.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AppleVisionPro">Vision Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-vision-pro.209">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/02/apple-vision-pro-demo-reservations/">Apple Vision Pro Demos on Monday and Later Can Be Reserved Online</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-vision-pro-demos-on-monday-and-later-can-be-reserved-online.2418148/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<title>Juno App Brings YouTube to Apple Vision Pro Because Google Won&#039;t</title>

		<description><![CDATA[Developer <a href="https://christianselig.com">Christian Selig</a> of "Apollo for Reddit" fame has created what Google wouldn't – a dedicated YouTube app for Apple Vision Pro.<br/>
<br/>
 <img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/juno-youtube.jpeg" alt="" width="2732" height="1868" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-934029" /><br/>
Called <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/juno-for-youtube/id6476961640">Juno for YouTube</a>, the app lets Vision Pro owners browse the YouTube platform in a cleanly refined visionOS interface without having to resort to the lackluster alternative, which is visiting the YouTube website in Safari.<br/>
<br/>
The video player includes native controls for interacting with the video, including resizing to create a home theater experience in your living room, repositioning, dimming your room around the video, and more.<br/>
<br/>
In addition, there's support for aspect ratio detection, and buttons to increase or decrease playback speed, toggle captions, and share videos. As you'd expect from a third-party app, no YouTube account is required to use Juno, and it won't auto-skip ads, but YouTube Premium subscribers will enjoy the benefits that accompany the tier through the app.<br/>
<br/>
Selig cautions that early adopters of the app may encounter a few bugs, since he has only been able to develop and interact with it in the Vision Pro simulator. But that's unlikely to concern users who are familiar with the developer's reputation and engagement with people who use his apps. Plus, he's getting a Vision Pro headset today.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-media-max-width="560"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">And here&#39;s a quick overview video showing it in action.

YouTube said earlier this month that it is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/18/youtube-spotify-vision-pro/">not developing a YouTube Vision Pro app</a>, nor will it allow the YouTube iPad app to run on the device. Netflix and Spotify have said the same thing. Netflix and Spotify will instead be accessible through Safari, similar to YouTube.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/juno-for-youtube/id6476961640">Juno for YouTube</a> is priced at &#36;4.99 and the app is already available on the App Store for nascent Vision Pro owners to check out.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/youtube/">YouTube</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/02/juno-app-youtube-apple-vision-pro/">Juno App Brings YouTube to Apple Vision Pro Because Google Won&#039;t</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/juno-app-brings-youtube-to-apple-vision-pro-because-google-wont.2418146/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

Apple's first-ever mixed reality headset offers both augmented and virtual reality features, and it is controlled with a combination of your eyes, hands, and voice. Apple describes the device as a "spatial computer" instead of a headset.<br/>
<br/>
"The era of spatial computing has arrived," said Apple CEO Tim Cook. "Apple Vision Pro is the most advanced consumer electronics device ever created. Its revolutionary and magical user interface will redefine how we connect, create, and explore."<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Independent record labels have expressed concerns about Apple's plans to pay more money for songs recorded in Spatial Audio, claiming it will only benefit the biggest companies in the marketplace, reports the <em><a href="https://www.ft.com/content/dc5a6ef2-acc6-456f-830a-84baad7c3db0">Financial Times</a></em>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/06/apple-music-spatial-audio-ad.jpeg" alt="" width="1280" height="720" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-804348" /><br/>
Last week, Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/23/apple-music-more-royalties-spatial-audio/">announced</a> royalty incentives to encourage music artists and record labels to publish tracks in Spatial Audio. Apple said it will pay up to 10% more in royalties for Spatial Audio, which uses Dolby Atmos technology to replicate an in-person music experience with sound coming from various directions around the listener. <br/>
<br/>
Apple has <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/02/16/apple-music-spatial-audio-lossless-interview/">said</a> that over half of Apple Music subscribers use the feature, and that the bonus is a reward for artists delivering the content, and also compensation to recognize the additional time and effort required to mix in Dolby Atmos.<br/>
<br/>
However, several independent labels told <em>FT</em> that the new incentive will effectively channel cash towards established megastars and away from other musicians who do not have the resources to compete. <br/>
<blockquote>"It's literally going to take the money out of independent labels and their artists, to benefit the biggest companies in the marketplace," said a senior executive at a large independent record company.<br/>
<br/>
"It's going to benefit the biggest player, Universal, because they're the ones with the resources to invest in that. Whereas the independent sector . . . we've found it hard to justify the expense of creating spatial masters . . . we're not in the business of chucking money just because Apple is saying you should be spending money on this."</blockquote>Another independent label told <em>FT</em> that the new deal will badly impact its revenues. <br/>
<br/>
Producing music in Spatial Audio is not cheap. Executives say it costs an extra &#36;1,000 per song, or roughly &#36;10,000 per album, and going back to remaster older tracks can double the costs. Some record executives have also questioned the artistic value of Spatial Audio, with one executive likening it to "hanging a digital 3D version of the 'Mona Lisa' and expecting Louvre patrons to prefer it." <br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has criticized Apple's compliance with the EU's Digital Markets Act (DMA) regulation, which forces Apple to let third-party developers create alternative App Stores and use their own payment systems, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/26/iphone-changes-coming-to-eu-users/">amongst other things</a>.  <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/App-Store-vs-EU-Feature-2.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-932826" /><br/>
Speaking to investors on Thursday during Meta's Q4 earnings call, Zuckerberg called Apple's new rules "so onerous" that he would not be surprised if any developer adopted them.<br/>
<blockquote>"I don't think that the Apple thing is going to have any difference for us. Because I think that the way they have implemented it, I would be very surprised if any developer chose to go into the alternative app stores that they have. They've made it so onerous, and I think so at odds with the intent of what the EU regulation was, that I think it's just going to be very difficult for anyone, including ourselves, to really seriously entertain what they're doing there."</blockquote>The introduction of the EU's DMA regulations were designed to increase competition in the bloc's app economy by allowing other companies to host their own app stores and collect payments, without them being subjected to Apple's commission rates. However, Apple has introduced a new fee structure as part of the change, including a €0.50 "<a href="https://developer.apple.com/support/core-technology-fee/">Core Technology Fee</a>" or CTF for every app install over one million installs, a model that could be <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/25/apple-eu-fees-could-bankrupt-app-developers/">prohibitively expensive for free apps</a> like Meta's if they are distributed outside of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Meta's comments broadly align with several other big companies critical of Apple's proposed DMA changes, including Spotify, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/epic-games/">Epic Games</a>, Mozilla, and Microsoft. <br/>
<br/>
<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/26/spotify-on-apple-eu-app-changes/">Spotify CEO Daniel EK</a> called Apple's plan "a complete and total farce" under "the false pretense of compliance and concessions." <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/25/fortnite-returning-to-ios-in-europe/">Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney</a>, another outspoken Apple critic, said that the ‌&zwnj;App Store&zwnj;‌ changes are a "devious new instance of malicious compliance" aimed at thwarting EU regulations. Microsoft <a href="https://twitter.com/bondsarah_bond/status/1752083596318593238">said</a> they are a "step in the wrong direction," while Mozilla said it was "extremely disappointed" and called the plans "another example of Apple creating barriers to prevent true browser competition on iOS."   <br/>
<br/>
EU regulators say they intend to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/01/technology/apple-app-store-europe.html">study Apple's proposed plans</a> after March 7, when the DMA goes into effect.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/european-union/">European Union</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/meta/">Meta</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/02/zuckerberg-criticizes-apple-dma-plans/">Zuckerberg Calls Apple&#039;s DMA Compliance Changes &#039;Onerous&#039; and &#039;Difficult to Seriously Entertain&#039;</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/zuckerberg-calls-apples-dma-compliance-changes-onerous-and-difficult-to-seriously-entertain.2418139/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[<a href="https://culturedcode.com/things/">Cultured Code</a> has officially released an all-new spatial computing version of Things 3, the popular personal task manager software, for Apple's Vision Pro headset, which launches today in the U.S.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/Things-3-for-Vision-1.jpg" alt="" width="3840" height="2160" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-933502" /><br/>
Developed from the ground up to be a fully featured native app for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/visionos/">visionOS</a>, the productivity app brings the familiar Things interface into the user's virtual workspace, allowing them to open multiple Things windows and arrange them around their immediate environment.<br/>
<br/>
The sidebar can be hidden to focus on a single list, or users can place it next to their other apps while they get things done. As you'd expect for a &zwnj;visionOS&zwnj; app, the Things interface can be navigated using eyes, hands, and voice. Available functions include the ability to search across lists, drag and drop to-dos, and dictate notes.<br/>
<br/>
The app also works with a wireless keyboard connection, offering full keyboard support, and Things for Vision Pro syncs with the app on Mac, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>, and Apple Watch.<br/>

		<title>Apple to Launch Foldable As Early As 2026 That Could Ultimately Replace iPad Mini</title>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple is considering launching its first foldable in the next few years in the form of a 7- to 8-inch device that could ultimately replace the 8.3-inch iPad mini.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/FoldPad-Redux-24-Magenta-and-Blue.jpg" alt="" width="2250" height="1265" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-934078" /><br/>
That's the latest claim to come out of Korean outlet <em><a href="https://www.thelec.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=25724">The Elec</a></em>. According to the report, Apple is reviewing a launch timeframe for the device between 2026 and 2027.<br/>
<br/>
However, Apple is also actively developing an OLED iPad mini, so there remains uncertainty within Apple about the nature and specifications of the foldable. Speculation reportedly remains rife in the industry around whether it will be a foldable iPhone or foldable iPad model.<br/>
<br/>
Samsung Display and LG Display have reportedly already been sending samples of 7-inch and 8-inch foldable panels to Apple since last year.<br/>
<br/>
Among the panel companies, Samsung is said to be more active in developing Apple foldable panels than LG, and is the more likely primary supplier of a foldable panel if Apple decides on a 2026 release. <br/>
<br/>
Apple, Samsung Display, and LG Display are also said to have "different ideas" about the ultra-thin glass material, foldable panel cover window, and the hinge concept, which is at the core of the product's mechanism. These differences reportedly involve contrasting judgements concerning product durability and reliability.<br/>
<br/>
Once mass production is decided, Samsung is expected to create the foldable panel in the 6th generation A3 or A4 OLED line that it uses to make OLED panels for Apple's iPhones.<br/>
<br/>
According to the report, Apple is also working on a larger 20.5-inch foldable product that is expected to be released later than the 7- to 8-inch device. The larger foldable has been rumored before by both <em><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/12/07/apple-20-inch-display-future-macbook-pro/">The Elec</a></em>, <em><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Bloomberg</a></em>, and Display Supply Chain Consultants (DSCC) analyst <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/03/25/bigger-ipad-pro-could-be-foldable/">Ross Young</a>. Young has also previously said that he expects a foldable tablet-like device in 2026 or 2027.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-mini/">iPad mini</a></div><div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/foldable-iphone/">Foldable iPhone</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/foldable-ipad/">Foldable iPad</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPad_Mini">iPad Mini (Don't Buy)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipad.137">iPad</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/02/apple-foldable-2026-could-replace-ipad-mini/">Apple to Launch Foldable As Early As 2026 That Could Ultimately Replace iPad Mini</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-to-launch-foldable-as-early-as-2026-that-could-ultimately-replace-ipad-mini.2418134/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today held its earnings call for the first fiscal quarter of 2024 (fourth calendar quarter of 2023), with Apple CEO <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tim-cook/">Tim Cook</a> and Apple CFO Luca Maestri sharing details on Apple's performance, recent product sales, services growth, and more.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/01/Apple-Logo-Cash-Feature-Yellow.jpg" alt="" width="2676" height="1504" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-834994" /><br/>
We've highlighted the most interesting takeaways from the earnings call.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>EU App Ecosystem Changes</h2><br/>
Maestri and Cook were asked about possible economic results from the changes that are being made to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a> in the European Union. Maestri said that the EU represents just seven percent of Apple's global &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; revenue, while Cook said that impact it is impossible to determine right now because Apple finds it difficult to predict what customers and developers will choose.<br/>
<br/>
"We've really focused on privacy, security and usability," Cook said. "And we've we've tried our best to get as close it in the past in terms of things that people love about our ecosystem, but we're going to fall short of providing the maximum amount that we could supply because we need to comply with the with the regulation."<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Vision Pro</h2><br/>
Apple CFO Luca Maestri said that several big companies are planning Vision Pro apps for customers and employees, including Walmart, Nike, Vanguard, Stryker, Bloomberg, and SAP. "From everyday productivity to collaborative product design to immersive training, we cannot wait to see the amazing things our enterprise customers will create in the months and years to come," said Maestri.<br/>
<br/>
Cook said that Apple is "incredibly excited about the enterprise opportunities" with Vision Pro. Walmart, for, example, has a "very cool" merchandising app. There are companies making collaboration and design apps, there are field service applications, apps for control center/command center work, and more. "Really all over the map," said Cook.<br/>
<br/>
"We couldn't be more excited about where things are right now," Cook said. "This has been multiple years of efforts from so many people across Apple and really took a whole of company effort to bring it this far."<br/>
<br/>
<h2>AI</h2><br/>
<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/01/apple-ai-details-coming-later-this-year/">Tim Cook said</a> that Apple is spending a "tremendous" amount of time and effort on artificial intelligence, and that details on its AI work will be shared later this year.<br/>
<blockquote>In terms of generative AI which I would guess is your focus, we have a lot of work going on internally, as I've alluded to before. Our MO, if you will, has always been to do work and then talk about work and not to get out in front of ourselves. And so we're going to hold that to this as well. but we've got some things that we're incredibly excited about, that we'll be talking about later this year.</blockquote><br/>
<br/>
<h2>Services</h2><br/>
Apple's Services category set an all-time revenue record at &#36;23.1 billion, up from &#36;20.7 billion in the year-ago quarter. Paid subscriptions grew double digits year-over-year.<br/>
<br/>
Apple set all-time revenue records in advertising cloud services, and payment services and video, along with December quarter records in the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/applecare/">AppleCare</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Wearables</h2><br/>
The Wearables, Home and Accessories category saw a drop in revenue, coming in at &#36;12 billion, down from &#36;13.4 billion last year.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Mac and iPad Sales</h2><br/>
Mac sales were about flat at &#36;7.8 billion (compared to &#36;7.7 billion last year), but <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> sales were way down as Apple released no new models in 2023. &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; revenue was &#36;7 billion, down from &#36;9.4 billion last year.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Active Devices</h2><br/>
Apple now has more than <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/01/apple-2-2-billion-active-devices/">2.2 billion active devices</a> worldwide, which includes iPhones, iPads, and Macs.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/earnings/">Earnings</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/aapl/">AAPL</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/01/apple-q1-2024-earnings-tidbits/">Apple&#039;s Q1 2024 Earnings Call Takeaways</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apples-q1-2024-earnings-call-takeaways.2418103/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>
