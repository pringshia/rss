		<description><![CDATA[Apple today held its annual shareholders meeting, and during the event, Apple CEO <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tim-cook/">Tim Cook</a> once again commented on Apple's AI plans. Cook said that the company will "break new ground" in generative AI in 2024. "We believe it will unlock transformative opportunities for our users," said Cook.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-840591" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/03/hey-siri-banner-apple.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="630" /><br/>
Cook has made several statements on Apple's artificial intelligence ambitions in recent months. <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/02/tim-cook-generative-ai-comments/">Back in November</a>, he said that Apple was "investing quite a bit" in AI, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/01/apple-ai-details-coming-later-this-year/">in February</a>, he said that the company was spending a "tremendous amount of time and effort" on AI, with more details to come later in the year.<br/>
<br/>
Multiple rumors have said that Apple will add new generative AI features in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a>, with plans to use AI to boost the capabilities of many of the built-in iOS apps.<br/>
<br/>
Aside from Cook's comments on AI, the shareholder meeting was business as usual. As <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-02-28/apple-shareholders-vote-down-request-for-ai-transparency-report">noted by <em>Bloomberg</em></a>, shareholders rejected a proposal asking Apple for an AI transparency report with details on whether AI is being used ethically.<br/>
<br/>
Apple's board and executive compensation plans were approved, but no shareholder proposals were accepted. Al Gore and James Bell are set to retire from Apple's board, while former Aerospace Corp. CEO Wanda Austin will join.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/aapl/">AAPL</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/28/tim-cook-apple-generative-ai-break-new-ground/">Tim Cook Says Apple Will &#039;Break New Ground&#039; in Generative AI</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/tim-cook-says-apple-will-break-new-ground-in-generative-ai.2420670/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today added the iMac with the M3 chip <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/refurbished/mac/2023-imac">to its certified refurbished store</a> in the U.S. for the first time since the computer was introduced in October.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/M3-iMac-Feature-Teal.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-921470" /><br/>
As usual for Apple's refurbished products, the refurbished iMacs are discounted by approximately 15% compared to the equivalent brand new models, with pricing starting at &#36;1,099. A variety of configurations and color options are available.<br/>
<br/>
All of the usual accessories are included in the box, including a Magic Keyboard, Magic Mouse, power adapter and cord, and USB-C to Lightning cable.<br/>
<br/>
Apple says it puts refurbished Macs through "full functionality testing" and a "thorough cleaning process and inspection," and they are covered by Apple's one-year limited warranty and eligible for extended AppleCare+ coverage.<br/>
<br/>
In our view, Apple's refurbished Macs are virtually indistinguishable from brand new ones, providing a good opportunity for savings directly from Apple. However, larger discounts are sometimes <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/best-apple-deals/">available from resellers like Amazon</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Apple recently began selling <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/07/apple-refurbished-14-inch-m3-macbook-pro/">refurbished MacBook Pro models with the M3 chip</a>, and later models with the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/19/refurbished-m3-pro-m3-max-macbook-pro/">M3 Pro and M3 Max chips</a>.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/">iMac</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-refurbished/">Apple Refurbished Products</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iMac">iMac (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/imac.91">iMac</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/28/apple-refurbished-m3-imac/">Apple Begins Selling Refurbished iMac With M3 Chip</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-begins-selling-refurbished-imac-with-m3-chip.2420664/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's decision to cancel its electric vehicle project has surprised ambitious new Chinese automakers like Xiaomi, the <a href="https://www.scmp.com/tech/big-tech/article/3253542/chinese-ev-players-surprised-apples-decision-cancel-car-project-xiaomi-ceo-lei-saying-he-remains?"><em>South China Morning Post</em></a> reports.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/12/Apple-car-wheel-icon-feature-triad.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-774149" /><br/>
Yesterday, <em>Bloomberg</em>'s <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a> revealed that after a decade of work and millions of dollars in development costs Apple has <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/27/apple-cancels-electric-car-project/">canceled its plans</a> to bring an EV to market, moving many of the 2,000 staff working on the project to generative AI instead. The decision has come as a surprise to new tech-focused Chinese EV brands like Xiaomi, Li Auto, and Xpeng, who saw a future Apple car as one of their main rivals.<br/>
<br/>
Xiaomi is one of China's biggest electronics companies and is best known for its line of smartphones. The company unveiled its first EV, the SU7, late last year and it is set to go on sale after further testing. The project required over &#36;1.4 billion in development and over 3,400 engineers.<br/>
<br/>
Founder and chairman Lei Jun today posted on Weibo that he was "very shocked" by the news of Apple's decision to cancel its EV. He added that he "knows deeply how difficult it is to make cars," but Xiaomi has made an "unshakeable strategic choice" to move into EVs. He Xiaopeng, chairman of Chinese EV maker Xpeng, expressed similar disbelief that Apple is abandoning its car plans.<br/>
<br/>
Li Xiang, CEO of Beijing-based EV maker Li Auto, remarked on Weibo that Apple's decision to shift emphasis from EVs to AI was "absolutely right." "AI will become the top-level entrance for all devices, services, applications and transactions, in which Apple should stay on top," he added.<br/>
<br/>
Chinese brands possess a rapidly growing proportion of global EV sales. Last year, China's BYD overtook Tesla as the world's top EV manufacturer.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-car/">Apple Car</a></div><div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/china/">China</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/scmp-com/">South China Morning Post</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/xiaomi/">Xiaomi</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-inc-and-tech-industry.8">Apple, Inc and Tech Industry</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/28/chinese-shocked-at-apple-car-cancelation/">Chinese Automakers Shocked at Apple&#039;s Decision to Cancel Car Project</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/chinese-automakers-shocked-at-apples-decision-to-cancel-car-project.2420658/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It may take several years for the Vision Pro headset to receive major hardware upgrades, according to Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/Apple-Vision-Pro-at-Steve-Jobs-Theater.jpeg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-898794" /><br/>
"It is currently estimated that new models with significant changes to the Vision Pro specification may not be in mass production until 2027," Kuo <a href="https://medium.com/@mingchikuo/vision-pro%E6%9B%B4%E6%96%B0-%E7%BE%8E%E5%9C%8B%E5%B8%82%E5%A0%B4%E9%9C%80%E6%B1%82%E5%B7%B2%E5%A4%A7%E5%B9%85%E6%94%BE%E7%B7%A9-%E5%85%A8%E7%90%83%E7%99%BC%E4%BD%88%E6%99%82%E7%A8%8B%E9%A0%90%E6%B8%AC-%E4%BE%9B%E6%87%89%E9%8F%88%E6%93%B4%E7%94%A2%E8%88%87%E9%80%80%E8%B2%A8%E7%8E%87%E8%A7%A3%E8%AE%80-%E6%96%B0%E6%A9%9F%E7%A8%AE%E9%A0%90%E6%B8%AC-%E6%8A%95%E8%B3%87%E7%AD%96%E7%95%A5-vision-pro-update-us-market-demand-f12ab8423404">said today</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Based on his latest supply chain checks, Kuo believes Apple has not started working on a second-generation Vision Pro, or a lower-priced version of the headset with reduced specs. However, research and development could be underway.<br/>
<br/>
Kuo does expect a modified Vision Pro to enter mass production in late 2025 to early 2026, but he said Apple is focused on improving costs and production, leading him to believe that the "user experience will not differ from the current model." It is possible these changes might not even be announced to the public, beyond a potential price cut.<br/>
<br/>
Kuo expects Apple to release the Vision Pro in additional countries <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/28/kuo-on-apple-vision-pro-wider-launch/">before WWDC in June</a>. The headset launched in the U.S. earlier this month.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/">Ming-Chi Kuo</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AppleVisionPro">Vision Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-vision-pro.209">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/28/kuo-vision-pro-major-upgrades-unlikely-until-2027/">Kuo: Apple Vision Pro Unlikely to Receive Major Upgrades Until 2027</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/kuo-apple-vision-pro-unlikely-to-receive-major-upgrades-until-2027.2420656/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo today <a href="https://medium.com/@mingchikuo/vision-pro%E6%9B%B4%E6%96%B0-%E7%BE%8E%E5%9C%8B%E5%B8%82%E5%A0%B4%E9%9C%80%E6%B1%82%E5%B7%B2%E5%A4%A7%E5%B9%85%E6%94%BE%E7%B7%A9-%E5%85%A8%E7%90%83%E7%99%BC%E4%BD%88%E6%99%82%E7%A8%8B%E9%A0%90%E6%B8%AC-%E4%BE%9B%E6%87%89%E9%8F%88%E6%93%B4%E7%94%A2%E8%88%87%E9%80%80%E8%B2%A8%E7%8E%87%E8%A7%A3%E8%AE%80-%E6%96%B0%E6%A9%9F%E7%A8%AE%E9%A0%90%E6%B8%AC-%E6%8A%95%E8%B3%87%E7%AD%96%E7%95%A5-vision-pro-update-us-market-demand-f12ab8423404">reiterated his belief</a> that the Apple Vision Pro will launch in additional countries <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/16/vision-pro-to-launch-internationally-before-wwdc/">before Apple's annual developers conference WWDC</a> in June. The headset first launched in the U.S. earlier this month.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/Apple-Vision-Pro-with-battery-Feature-Blue-Magenta.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-898550" /><br/>
Apple will likely expand the Vision Pro to more English-speaking countries, such as Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the U.K., but it has also been localizing visionOS in preparation to launch the headset in countries like France, Germany, Italy, and Spain.<br/>
<br/>
Kuo said demand for the Vision Pro in the U.S. has "slowed down significantly" since the headset launched there on February 2. He estimated that U.S. shipments of the headset will total 200,000 to 250,000 units this year, which he said is better than Apple's original estimate of 150,000 to 200,000 units, but it is still a "niche market."<br/>
<br/>
In recent weeks, there was a lot of discussion about Vision Pro returns on social media. However, based on his inspection of the "repair/refurbishment production line" for the headset, Kuo estimated that the current return rate is "less than 1%."<br/>
<br/>
All in all, Kuo said the Vision Pro launch in the U.S. played out mostly in line with his expectations, beyond a "higher-than-expected number of early adopters."<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/">Ming-Chi Kuo</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AppleVisionPro">Vision Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-vision-pro.209">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/28/kuo-on-apple-vision-pro-wider-launch/">Kuo: Apple Vision Pro on Track to Launch in More Countries Before WWDC in June</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/kuo-apple-vision-pro-on-track-to-launch-in-more-countries-before-wwdc-in-june.2420650/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Experian and Apple today <a href="https://www.experianplc.com/newsroom/press-releases/2024/experian-consumer-credit-reports-to-now-include-apply-pay-later-loan-information">announced</a> that Apple Pay Later loan information will soon appear on Experian's credit reports. The companies said this move will provide "greater transparency" and help to protect both lenders and borrowers.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/04/Apple-Pay-Later.jpeg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-893903" /><br/>
Apple Pay Later loans initiated today onward will appear on a customer's Experian credit report with a BNPL ("buy now, pay later") designation starting March 1, according to Experian. This information will have no effect on a customer's credit score right now, but Experian says it could in the future, as new credit scoring models are developed.<br/>
<br/>
Apple provided more details in a <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212971">support document</a> updated today:<blockquote>Apple Pay Later loans and payment history will be reported to Experian. Your credit score won't be affected when we start sharing your Apple Pay Later loan and payment history, but might be affected in the future once data is incorporated by credit scoring models, like FICO®. Information about your purchase, like the loan start date, loan amount, loan status, outstanding balance, payment dates, and payment history will be shared, which will help to build your credit history. If your purchase is canceled or fully refunded, the loan will not be reported.</blockquote>Experian is the first credit bureau that will report Apple Pay Later loans, and the information will eventually be visible to lenders performing hard inquiries.<br/>
<br/>
"By reporting Apple Pay Later loans to Experian, we aim to help promote greater transparency and responsible lending for both the borrower and the lender, while providing users with the opportunity to further build their credit," said Jennifer Bailey, Apple's vice president of Apple Pay and Apple Wallet, in a press release.<br/>
<br/>
Apple Pay Later <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/24/apple-pay-later-launches/">launched in the U.S. last year</a>, and it allows qualifying customers to split a purchase made with Apple Pay into four equal payments over six weeks, with no interest or fees. The feature is available for eligible purchases between &#36;75 and &#36;1,000 made on an iPhone or iPad on most websites and apps that accept Apple Pay.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-pay/">Apple Pay</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-pay-later/">Apple Pay Later</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-music-apple-pay-card-icloud-fitness.134">Apple Music, Apple Pay/Card, iCloud, Fitness+</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/28/apple-pay-later-loans-on-experian-credit-reports/">Apple Pay Later Loans Will Soon Appear on Experian Credit Reports</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-pay-later-loans-will-soon-appear-on-experian-credit-reports.2420643/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hardware prototyping consultant Ken Pillonel's latest project switches the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-max/">AirPods Max</a>'s Lightning port for USB-C as part of his ongoing efforts to highlight repairability and sustainability issues in consumer electronics.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/airpods-max-usb-c-ken-pillonel.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-938501" /><br/>
The project comes as a response to discontent among some users regarding the premium headphones' continued reliance on the Lightning port for charging while most other Apple devices have made the switch to USB-C, as well as rumors that the second-generation version of the device will finally make the transition. It also serves as a viable fix for damaged &zwnj;AirPods Max&zwnj; Lightning ports, which are costly to replace.<br/>
<br/>
Pillonel created a custom replacement part to allow any technically proficient &zwnj;AirPods Max&zwnj; users to upgrade their headphones to USB-C themselves. The endeavor involved intricate design and manufacturing processes, including the development of an open-source USB-C conversion circuit and a custom printed circuit board that fits perfectly without the need to drill or damaging any of the original components.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Qnw56zHnydE?si=0qbN37UAxoEFKYJ-" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><br/>
<br/>
The replacement part is designed to sit atop the existing board, meticulously avoiding contact with any other components. The design also addresses potential durability concerns with a flexible section that mitigates stress on the connector, enhancing the kit's longevity.<br/>
<br/>
Pillonel explored the possibility of enabling audio pass-through via the USB-C port but ultimately decided against it due to the prohibitive cost and complexity of integrating Apple's proprietary technology. The conversion kit, along with detailed instructions, is available for purchase via <a href="https://shop.kenp.io">Pillonel's online shop</a>. <br/>
<br/>
The second-generation &zwnj;AirPods Max&zwnj; are <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/19/new-airpods-later-this-year-rumor/">rumored to launch in late 2024</a>, with the main upgrade being a USB-C port in place of Lightning. No other significant changes are expected, meaning that the headphones will likely <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/20/airpods-max-2-could-miss-out-on-adaptive-audio/">miss out on features</a> including the H2 chip and Adaptive Audio, but there might be some new color options.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-max/">AirPods Max</a></div><div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/usb-c/">USB-C</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ken-pillonel/">Ken Pillonel</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AirPods-Max">AirPods Max (Caution)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/airpods.216">AirPods</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/28/airpods-max-project-makes-rumored-upgrade-a-reality/">AirPods Max Project Makes Rumored Upgrade for Next-Gen Model a Reality</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/airpods-max-project-makes-rumored-upgrade-for-next-gen-model-a-reality.2420641/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<title>Apple Likely Already Designing Chips Based on TSMC&#039;s 2nm Process</title>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple is already designing the chips that will use TSMC's next-generation 2-nanometer fabrication process, according to information allegedly sourced from an Apple employee on LinkedIn.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/10/Apple-Silicon-Teal-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-767478" /><br/>
Originally captured by Korean website <a href="https://gamma0burst.tistory.com/m/1107">gamma0burst</a> and shared on X (Twitter) by the leaker <a href="https://x.com/Tech_Reve/status/1762774972852998249?s=20">Revegnus</a> (@Tech_Reve), the information appears in a heavily redacted slide said to list the employee's work on past and current projects at Apple.<br/>
<br/>
A non-redacted part of the slide reads "TS5nm, TS3nm, working on TS2nm," terms believed to reference the different fabrication processes Apple has chosen for past, current, and future chips. Terms like "3nm" and "2nm" refer to the specific architecture and design rules TSMC is using for a family of chips. Decreases in node size correspond to a smaller transistor size, so more transistors can fit on a processor, leading to boosts in speed and more efficient power consumption. <br/>
<br/>
Rumors <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/15/next-gen-chip-technology-on-track-for-2025/">suggest</a> that TSMC is already starting work on more advanced 1.4-nanometer chips, which are expected to come out as soon as 2027. Apple is said to be looking to reserve TSMC's initial manufacturing capabilities for both 1.4nm and 1nm technologies. To get a sense of the nanometer scale, a strand of human hair is about 80,000 to 100,000nm wide. <br/>
<br/>
Last year, Apple adopted 3nm chips for its iPhones and Macs, an upgrade over the prior 5nm mode. The switch to 3nm technology brought 20 percent faster GPU speeds, 10 percent faster CPU speed, and a 2x faster Neural Engine to the iPhone, and similar improvements on Macs.  <br/>
<br/>
Apple is believed to be the first company that will <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/24/apple-tsmc-first-2nm-chips/">receive chips built on TSMC's future 2nm process</a>, which is expected to go into production in the second half of 2025. The 2nm fabrication process, also known simply as "N2," is expected to offer a 10 to 15 percent speed improvement at the same power or a 25 to 30 percent power reduction at the same speed compared to chips made with the supplier's ‌3nm‌ technology.<br/>
<br/>
TSMC is building two new facilities to accommodate 2nm chip production, and is waiting on approval for a third. The Taiwanese fab giant is spending billions on the change, and Apple will also need to make chip design changes to accommodate the new technology. Apple is TSMC's main client, and it is typically the first to get TSMC's new chips. Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/29/apple-buys-all-3nm-tsmc-chips-2023/">acquired all of TSMC's 3-nanometer chips</a> in 2023 for iPhones, iPads, and Macs, for example.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tsmc/">TSMC</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/revegnus/">Revegnus</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/2nm/">2nm</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/28/apple-designing-2nm-silicon-chips/">Apple Likely Already Designing Chips Based on TSMC&#039;s 2nm Process</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-likely-already-designing-chips-based-on-tsmcs-2nm-process.2420633/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

The Heavy Rotation Mix features 25 songs and joins the Favorites Mix, Get Up! Mix, Chill Mix, New Music Mix, and Friends Mix. Unlike the pre-existing personalized playlists which are all updated on a weekly basis, Heavy Rotation is updated daily, allowing it to evolve as your listening habits change. <br/>
<br/>
&zwnj;Apple Music&zwnj; users can listen to their own Heavy Rotation Mix and add it to their library by navigating to Listen Now, where it appears under Top Picks.<br/>
<br/>
The Heavy Rotation Mix is the latest feature to join &zwnj;Apple Music&zwnj; after a series of small upgrades in recent months. Earlier in February, Apple launched a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/20/apple-music-launches-monthly-replay-experience/">monthly Apple Music Replay experience</a>, as well as new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/14/apple-music-love-heartbreak-stations/">"Love" and "Heartbreak" personalized radio stations</a>. &zwnj;Apple Music&zwnj; also seems to be <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/20/apple-music-testing-playlist-import-feature/">testing a service</a> to import a music library from other streaming services.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/">Apple Music</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/28/apple-music-heavy-rotation-mix/">Apple Music Gains Personalized &#039;Heavy Rotation Mix&#039; Playlist</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-music-gains-personalized-heavy-rotation-mix-playlist.2420630/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple representatives met with the U.S. Justice Department last week in a last ditch effort to persuade the agency not to file an antitrust suit against the company, according to <em><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-02-27/apple-met-with-justice-department-in-final-bid-to-avoid-antitrust-suit">Bloomberg</a></em>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/01/iOS-App-Store-General-Feature-JoeBlue.jpg" alt="" width="2250" height="1266" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-833073" /><br/>
Citing people familiar with the matter, the report states that Apple and its lawyers met with Assistant Attorney General Jonathan Kanter, who will have the final say on whether to file a suit.<br/>
<br/>
Since 2019, the Justice Department has been <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2019/07/23/doj-tech-company-antitrust-review/">looking into Apple's App Store business practices</a> and whether iOS favors Apple's own apps and services over those provided by third-party developers and other companies.<br/>
<br/>
The DOJ began by inquiring about Apple's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a> policies, and reportedly met with developers to learn more about the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj;'s review process. <br/>
<br/>
The department reportedly <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/02/15/doj-ramping-up-apple-antitrust-probe/">escalated</a> its probe in early 2023 by assigning additional litigators to the case and requesting documents and consultations with companies connected to the investigation.<br/>
<br/>
Apple has been accused of or investigated for anticompetitive practices in several other countries over the past few years, with many of the complaints related to the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj;. Most recently, Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/19/iphone-changes-coming-to-eu-users/">announced</a> major changes to the way the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; and apps operate in the EU in order to comply with the bloc's inbound Digital Markets Act before March 7, and the DOJ has reportedly been monitoring these developments.<br/>
<br/>
The DOJ is expected to make its first legal move in the coming weeks, likely by the end of March, according to <em>Bloomberg</em>'s sources, potentially leaving Apple facing an antitrust lawsuit brought by the U.S. government.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/antitrust/">Apple Antitrust</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/28/apple-met-justice-department-antitrust/">Apple Met With DOJ Antitrust Chief in Bid to Head Off Antitrust Lawsuit</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-met-with-doj-antitrust-chief-in-bid-to-head-off-antitrust-lawsuit.2420623/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[After more than a year since announcing the feature, Google Maps is finally rolling out glanceable directions on Android and iOS (via <em><a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/google-maps-is-finally-making-glanceable-directions-widely-available/">Android Police</a></em>).<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/04/Google-maps-feaure.jpg" alt="" width="2250" height="1266" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-793593" /><br/>
The feature allows users to view turn-by-turn directions and a live ETA directly from their device's lock screen – information that was previously only visible when a phone was unlocked.<br/>
<br/>
Glanceable directions also work on the app's route overview screen that appears after launching directions, before users tap the Start button. Google Maps will show directions, live ETA, and even update the route if the user takes a different path, as shown in the GIF embedded below.<br/>
<br/>
Glanceable directions are off by default, but can be enabled in the app's main settings, under Navigation. In our tests on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>, the setting only appeared after switching Google accounts, suggesting the feature is still rolling out. However, we are still not seeing support for Live Activities in iOS, which was promised a year ago.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/glanceable-directions-google-maps.jpg" alt="google maps" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-938633" /><br/>
Google first announced glanceable directions last <a href="https://blog.google/products/maps/sustainable-immersive-maps-announcements/">February</a>, and in June said the feature was rolling out that month for walking, cycling, and driving directions on Android and iOS, including compatibility with Live Activities in iOS 16.1. <br/>

Based on assets recently <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/10/google-maps-live-activities-support-continues/">unearthed</a> by <em>MacRumors</em> in an earlier version of the app, Google Maps continues to work on integrating Live Activities support for iPhones, but when we'll actually see it at this point is anyone's guess.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/google-maps/">Google Maps</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/28/google-maps-rolls-out-glanceable-directions/">Google Maps Finally Rolls Out Glanceable Directions</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/google-maps-finally-rolls-out-glanceable-directions.2420618/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today publicly confirmed that iOS 17.4 and iPadOS 17.4 allow developers of video calling apps to turn off the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/use-reaction-effects-facetime/">Reactions feature</a> by default in their apps.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/02/ios-17-facetime-effects.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1070" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-900390" /><br/>
As we <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/07/apple-api-for-turning-off-3d-gesture-effects/">reported earlier this month</a>, developers can control the default behavior of Reactions in their apps with a new API for iOS 17.4, iPadOS 17.4, and likely macOS 14.4. The updates are expected to be released to the public in March.<br/>
<br/>
Apple's <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/ios-ipados-release-notes/ios-ipados-17_4-release-notes">developer notes</a> for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/27/apple-seeds-ios-17-4-release-candidate/">iOS 17.4 and iPadOS 17.4 Release Candidates</a>:<blockquote>Developers can control the default behavior of Reactions with the key […] This is controlled per application and user choice will override application declared defaults.</blockquote>For example, video conferencing app Zoom could use Apple's new API to turn off the Reactions feature in its app by default. iPhone and iPad users who manually turn Reactions back on in Control Center would still be able to use the feature in the app. <br/>
<br/>
Reactions remain turned on by default on iOS 17.4 overall, so they still work in FaceTime and in apps that do not use the API without any further steps required.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Reactions</h2><br/>
Starting with iOS 17, iPadOS 17, and macOS Sonoma, you can make hand gestures during video calls in the FaceTime app and other video conferencing apps to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/use-reaction-effects-facetime/">fill the screen with 3D effects</a>. For example, you can hold two thumbs up to show fireworks on the screen, or make two peace signs with your hands to show confetti.<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately, many users are unaware that this new feature is turned on by default, which has led to some awkward and embarrassing moments during important video calls, such as online therapy sessions and business meetings.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-media-max-width="560"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Fetterman released the confetti on Zoom on MSNBC <a href="https://t.co/fpylDiU1uc">pic.twitter.com/fpylDiU1uc</a></p>&mdash; Andy Kaczynski (@KFILE) <a href="https://twitter.com/KFILE/status/1761108102575710607?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 23, 2024</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div><br/>
Instead of turning off Reactions by default altogether, Apple is allowing developers to control the feature on a per-app basis with this new API.<br/>

As found by <a href="https://twitter.com/SteveMoser"><em>MacRumors</em> contributor Steve Moser</a>, the spring colors include Light Blue, Ocean Blue, Pink, Raspberry, Soft Mint, and Sunshine (likely a light yellow). There are also two Hermes colors, Bleu Céleste and Jaune de Naples.<br/>
<br/>
When released, these colors will be available for watch faces that support different color options, and they'll be listed in a Spring 2024 section in the Apple Watch app on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>. Right now, the colors are not showing up there.<br/>
<br/>
Apple often also uses these same colors for new &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; cases and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> cases.

		<description><![CDATA[Apple is working on an updated version of its popular Beats Solo on-ear headphones, according to code located in the iOS 17.4 release candidate that Apple put out today. <em>MacRumors</em> contributor Aaron Perris found several references to the Beats Solo 4 headphones, including images. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/new-beats-solo-4.jpg" alt="" width="1129" height="635" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-938522" /><br/>
The Beats Solo 4 look similar to the Solo 3 headphones, but have design tweaks that bring them in line with the Beats Studio Pro. Spatial Audio is supported according to the code, but we don't know what other features to expect at this time. <br/>
<br/>
There are three colors in the files, including black, pink, and blue. We can expect some of the changes that were brought to the Beats Studio Pro last year, such as improved sound quality and support for Personalized Spatial Audio. The headphones will support the same gestures as the Studio Pro, with a press on the "b" button to play/pause and answer calls, a double press to skip songs, and a long press to activate <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a>. Apple will also likely swap the old micro-USB port for a new USB-C port to bring the headphones in line with the rest of its products. <br/>

Apple has been working on an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-car/">Apple Car</a> for more than a decade and invested millions of dollars into development before deciding it was not a viable project.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-774150" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/12/Apple-car-wheel-icon-feature-yellow.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" /><br/>
Apple's Chief Operating Officer Jeff Williams today told approximately 2,000 employees working on the &zwnj;Apple Car&zwnj; that the project was canceled, and the information reportedly came as a surprise.<br/>
<br/>
Work on the &zwnj;Apple Car&zwnj; is winding down and many of the people that were working on the car will move to Apple's artificial intelligence division to work on generative AI under AI chief John Giannandrea.<br/>
<br/>
There are a number of hardware engineers and car designers that were on the &zwnj;Apple Car&zwnj; team, and there will be layoffs. Some of the employees may be able to shift to other divisions within the company.<br/>
<br/>
Earlier this year, there were rumors that the &zwnj;Apple Car&zwnj; project had been scaled back, with Apple abandoning plans for a full driverless car with autonomous capabilities. Apple shifted focus to an electric vehicle with fewer self-driving features, and the vehicle would have been on par with Tesla's technology. Apple was aiming to release the car sometime around 2026, but now those plans have been shelved completely.<br/>
<br/>
News of the &zwnj;Apple Car&zwnj; first surfaced in 2014, and since then, the project has been rife with problems. The focus of the work has changed and evolved multiple times, and Apple has had several leadership changes due to internal strife. Apple Watch chief Kevin Lynch <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/09/kevin-lynch-apple-car-project/">took over the project in 2021</a>, and he worked to scale down the project while still putting out a viable car.<br/>
<br/>
According to <em>Bloomberg</em>, senior Apple executives made the decision to wind down the &zwnj;Apple Car&zwnj; project in recent weeks.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/27/apple-cancels-electric-car-project/">Apple Cancels Electric Car Project</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-cancels-electric-car-project.2420570/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

A free or paid <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-id/">Apple ID</a> associated with a developer account is required to download and install the beta.<br/>

iOS 17.4 introduces sweeping changes to the way the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a> and apps operate in the European Union, paving the way for alternative app marketplaces, alternative payment systems, third-party browser engine support, and NFC access for banks and third-party payment providers. These features are limited to the EU, and won't be available in other countries.<br/>
<br/>
There are, however, changes to gaming apps, and with the launch of iOS 17.4, Apple will be allowing cloud gaming apps like Xbox Cloud Gaming and Nvidia GeForce NOW. Mini games, chatbots, and plug-ins are also now able to use the in-app purchase system. Along with these updates, iOS 17.4 adds new emoji characters, transcripts for podcasts in the Podcasts app, support for using SharePlay with the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod/">HomePod</a>, Stopwatch Live Activities, and more. Apple's release notes for the update are below.<blockquote><strong>Emoji</strong><br/>
- New mushroom, phoenix, lime, broken chain, and shaking heads emoji are now available in the emoji keyboard<br/>
- 18 people and body emoji add the option to face them in either direction<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Apple Podcasts</strong><br/>
- Transcripts let you follow an episode with text that highlights in sync with the audio in English, Spanish, French and German<br/>
- Episode text can be read in full, searched for a word or phrase, tapped to play from a specific point and used with accessibility features such as Text Size, Increase Contrast, and VoiceOver<br/>
<br/>
<strong>This update includes the following enhancements and bug fixes:</strong><br/>
- Music recognition lets you add songs you have identified to your Apple Music Playlists and Library, as well as Apple Music Classical<br/>
- Siri has a new option to announce messages you receive in any supported language<br/>
- Stolen Device Protection supports the option for increased security in all locations<br/>
- Battery Health in Settings shows battery cycle count, manufacture date, and first use on iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Pro models<br/>
- Call Identification displays Apple-verified business name, logo, and department name when available<br/>
- Business updates in Messages for Business provide trusted information for order status, flight notifications, fraud alerts or other transactions you opt into<br/>
- Apple Cash virtual card numbers enable you to pay with Apple Cash at merchants that don't yet accept Apple Pay by typing in your number from Wallet or using Safari AutoFill<br/>
- Fixes an issue where contact pictures are blank in Find My<br/>
- Fixes an issue for Dual SIM users where the phone number changes from primary to secondary and is visible to a group they have messaged<br/>

<br/>
&zwnj;macOS Sonoma&zwnj; 14.4 introduces some of the features in the iOS 17.4 beta, such as new emoji characters. We don't know what Mac-specific features are included, and little else was found in the betas so far. <div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sonoma/">macOS Sonoma</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macos-sonoma.243">macOS Sonoma</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/27/apple-seeds-macos-sonoma-14-4-beta-5/">Apple Seeds macOS Sonoma 14.4 Beta 5 to Developers [Update: Public Beta Available]</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-seeds-macos-sonoma-14-4-beta-5-to-developers-update-public-beta-available.2420566/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today released fourth beta of an upcoming <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/visionos/">visionOS</a> 1.1 update for developers, allowing them to test new features ahead of the software seeing a public launch. The new update comes a week after the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/20/apple-releases-third-beta-of-visionos-1-1/">release of the third beta</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-934088" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/visionOS-Home-Screen.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" /><br/>
The &zwnj;visionOS&zwnj; beta can be downloaded by going to the Settings app on the device and toggling on developer betas. A registered developer account is required, and Apple recommends making a backup before installing new software.<br/>
<br/>
&zwnj;visionOS&zwnj; 1.1 brings support for iMessage Contact Key Verification and it adds Apple device management to the Vision Pro. With this functionality, IT departments at companies and educational institutions can manage Vision Pro headsets in the same way they manage iPhones, iPads, and Macs.<br/>
<br/>
According to Apple's beta notes, users can now reposition volumetric scenes closer than before, enabling easier direct interaction with the volumetric scene content. That means objects can be placed closer to you.<br/>
<br/>
Apple has also improved Personas in &zwnj;visionOS&zwnj; 1.1, making them look more natural and lifelike than before. <div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/visionos/">visionOS</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-vision-pro.209">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/27/apple-releases-visionos-1-1-beta-4/">Apple Releases visionOS 1.1 Beta 4</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-releases-visionos-1-1-beta-4.2420567/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>
