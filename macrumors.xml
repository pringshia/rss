		<description><![CDATA[Google <a href="https://blog.google/products/shopping/google-shopping-ai-update-october-2024/">today announced</a> a new <a href="https://www.google.com/shopping">Google Shopping experience</a> that has been updated to take advantage of artificial intelligence. Google Shopping has been rebuilt from the ground up with AI, pairing 45 billion product listings with Google Gemini AI models to provide a more personalized shopping experience.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/02/Google-Logo-Feature-Slack.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-837104" /><br/>
The overhauled Google Shopping feature uses AI to show the most relevant products when someone searches for something to buy. Google will provide an AI-generated brief with top suggestions to consider when making a purchase, along with some recommendations.<br/>
<br/>
Results will be organized into categories to provide an overview of different types of products, and there are dynamic filters that will let users narrow down results based on their preferences. Google has also added in the virtual try-on option and AR shopping tools, along with a "Deals" section for browsing personalized deals.<br/>
<br/>
There is a new Google Shopping home page that has a personalized feed populated with suggestions based on user preference and past searches. Personalized results can be turned off by going to the Google Shopping menu and tapping on "Shopping preferences" at the bottom of the page.<br/>
<br/>
The <a href="https://www.google.com/shopping">new Google Shopping website</a> is rolling out now in the United States, but not all users will see it right away. Google says it will take a few weeks for it to be available to all U.S. users.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/google/">Google</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/15/google-shopping-ai-update/">Google Shopping Revamped With AI Integration and Personalized Suggestions</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/google-shopping-revamped-with-ai-integration-and-personalized-suggestions.2440162/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<title>Is an Apple Event Still Likely This October Following Today&#039;s Surprise iPad Mini 7 Announcement?</title>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple has held an October event in three out of the past four years, but is an event this month still likely after today's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/15/apple-unveils-new-ipad-mini-apple-intelligence/">surprise iPad mini 7 announcement</a>?<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/scary-fast-apple-event.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-918366" /><br/>
While some Apple enthusiasts believe that the iPad mini 7 being unveiled in a press release today means that Apple is unlikely to hold an October event this year, the announcement does not entirely rule out the possibility. Last year, Apple held a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/30/everything-apple-announced-october-2023-event/">30-minute virtual event on October 30</a> to introduce new MacBook Pro and iMac models with the M3 series of chips, so another Mac-focused event this October would not be out of the ordinary.<br/>
<br/>
This month's updates to the Mac lineup are rumored to be more significant than those announced a year ago. In addition to updated MacBook Pro and iMac models with the M4 series of chips, the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/03/mac-mini-redesign-rumor/">Mac mini is expected to receive its biggest redesign since 2010</a>, and that might be something that Apple wants to highlight on video during a virtual event this month. According to rumors, the new Mac mini will be nearly as small as an Apple TV, and feature two front-facing USB-C ports, which would make it look more like the Mac Studio.<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/07/apple-debuts-m4-chip/">already unveiled the standard M4 chip</a> in the iPad Pro earlier this year, whereas the M3 chip was unveiled at the October event last year. Still, there are the higher-end M4 Pro and M4 Max chips that need to be announced.<br/>
<br/>
This isn't to say that Apple will for sure host an event this month. Rather, there is simply no reason that the iPad mini being announced early rules out an event.<br/>
<br/>
What do you think? Will there be an event this month, or simply more press releases?<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/15/will-there-be-an-october-2024-apple-event/">Is an Apple Event Still Likely This October Following Today&#039;s Surprise iPad Mini 7 Announcement?</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/is-an-apple-event-still-likely-this-october-following-todays-surprise-ipad-mini-7-announcement.2440156/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<title>Sonos Launches New &#36;999 Arc Ultra Soundbar and &#36;799 Sub 4</title>

		<description><![CDATA[Sonos <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20241015718674/en/Sonos-Reveals-Arc-Ultra-its-New-Soundbar-Featuring-Sound-MotionTM">today announced</a> the launch of two new products, the Arc Ultra Soundbar and the Sonos Sub 4. The Sonos Arc Ultra is a new high-end soundbar that's priced at &#36;999, while the &#36;799 Sub 4 is the newest Sonos subwoofer with improved design and internals.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/10/sonos-arc-ultra.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-970998" /><br/>
The Arc Ultra offers up to double the bass of its predecessor, thanks to new transducer technology called Sound Motion. Sound Motion cuts down on the size of the transducer while also improving bass, for better sound from smaller devices. There are 14 Sonos-engineered drivers, the Sound Motion woofer, and a cluster of tweeters with waveguides to provide a 9.1.4 spatial audio experience.<br/>
<br/>
New center channel architecture maximizes vocal clarity to make it easier to follow dialogue, and there is a Speech Enhancement feature for customization. Trueplay can be used to customize audio to a specific space.<br/>
<br/>
Compared to the prior version of the Sonos Arc, the Arc Ultra has a curved design, matte finish, and slimmer build that doesn't obstruct TV bezels. There are touch controls behind the soundbar and an easy setup process through HDMI eARC.<br/>
<br/>
The Sub 4 has a similar design to the Sub 3, but there is a new matte finish and a profile that allows it to stand upright, be placed on its side, or tucked under furniture. Sonos upped the processing power and memory of the Sub 4, and added new Wi-Fi radios for improved connectivity. Sonos says Sub 4 was created with inward-facing woofers to neutralize distortion, and the new model is compatible with the Arc Ultra, Arc, or Beam, as well as older versions of the Sub.<br/>
<br/>
These are the first two products that Sonos has introduced since its <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/23/sonos-app-development-insight/">ill-received app overhaul</a> in May. Sonos opted to delay launching new devices earlier in 2024 in order to make improvements to the Sonos app, which have included bug fixes and feature additions to match the functionality of the original Sonos app. Sonos had delayed new product launches, but CEO Patrick Spence said that the company now feels the app has been improved enough to introduce new devices.<br/>
<blockquote>"We've worked tirelessly to resolve the most critical app issues and most requested legacy features. We have reached a level of quality that gives us the confidence to launch our extraordinary new products," said Patrick Spence, CEO of Sonos. "As we laid out in our commitments we will continue to improve the software regularly, and are determined to make the Sonos experience better than it's ever been."</blockquote><br/>
<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/01/sonos-customer-service-software-quality/">Earlier this month</a>, Sonos recommitted to software quality and customer experience, promising to focus more on customer experience while also testing future app changes with customers before rolling them out.<br/>
<br/>
Alongside the new devices, Sonos plans to roll out a new app update that will "surpass the performance of the previous app" across metrics like system identification, new device setup, and grouping multiple Sonos devices together. Sonos claims that the update will "reintroduce 90 percent of the new app's missing features."<br/>
<br/>
The Sonos Arc Ultra and Sub 4 will be <a href="https://www.sonos.com/en-us/home">available from the Sonos website</a> on October 29.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/sonos/">Sonos</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/15/sonos-arc-ultra-soundbar/">Sonos Launches New &#36;999 Arc Ultra Soundbar and &#36;799 Sub 4</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/sonos-launches-new-999-arc-ultra-soundbar-and-799-sub-4.2440147/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today released a new beta firmware update for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/">AirPods Pro</a> 2, with the software available for both the Lightning and USB-C versions of the &zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj;. The firmware has a build number of 7B5013d, up from 7B5013c, and as it is a beta, it is only available for developers at the current time. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/10/AirPods-Pro-2-New-Firmware-Feature-Warm.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-970993" /><br/>
It is not clear what's included in the firmware update at this time, but Apple is planning to introduce hearing aid and hearing test functionality for the &zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj; 2 sometime this year. <br/>
<br/>
While the current firmware is limited to developers right now, it will be released for all &zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj; 2 users in the future. <br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/15/apple-airpods-pro-2-beta-firmware-7b5013d/">Apple Releases New AirPods Pro 2 Beta Firmware</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-releases-new-airpods-pro-2-beta-firmware.2440138/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<title>In the iPad Mini 7 Box: No Charger in Europe, New Braided USB-C Cable</title>

		<description><![CDATA[The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/15/apple-unveils-new-ipad-mini-apple-intelligence/">new iPad mini 7</a> does not come with a charger in the box in European countries, including the UK, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, the Netherlands, and others. This change is likely in response to EU regulations regarding electronic waste that will be enforced starting in 2026, but even some European countries that are not part of the EU are impacted.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/10/ipad-mini-7-charger-feature.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-970974" /><br/>
The latest iPad Pro and iPad Air models, introduced earlier this year, also do not come with a charger in the box in Europe.<br/>
<br/>
The lack of a charger in the box with iPads only applies to Europe for the time being. Apple includes a 20W USB-C charger with the iPad mini 7 in the U.S., Canada, Australia, Japan, Brazil, and other countries around the world.<br/>
<br/>
It is likely that the iPad mini 7 does not include Apple stickers in the box either, as part of Apple's goal of removing plastic from its packaging by next year. This is a trend we've seen all year long, with the Vision Pro, the latest iPad Pro and iPad Air models, and the iPhone 16 series also lacking Apple stickers inside the box. Customers can still ask for Apple stickers if they are purchasing these devices in person at an Apple retail store.<br/>
<br/>
There is one tiny bit of good news: the USB-C charging cable included with the iPad mini is now braided for added durability.<br/>
<br/>
Apple began accepting iPad mini 7 orders today, and the device launches on October 23.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-mini/">iPad mini</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPad_Mini">iPad Mini (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipad.137">iPad</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/15/whats-in-the-ipad-mini-7-box/">In the iPad Mini 7 Box: No Charger in Europe, New Braided USB-C Cable</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/in-the-ipad-mini-7-box-no-charger-in-europe-new-braided-usb-c-cable.2440136/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today provided developers with the seventh beta of an upcoming <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sequoia/">macOS Sequoia</a> 15.1 beta, with the new update coming one week after Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/07/apple-seeds-macos-sequoia-15-1-beta-6/">released the sixth beta</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-955370" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/macOS-Sequoia-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" /><br/>
Registered developers can opt-in to the &zwnj;macOS Sequoia&zwnj; beta through the Software Update section of the System Settings app. An <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-id/">Apple ID</a> associated with an Apple Developer account is required to get the beta.<br/>
<br/>
&zwnj;macOS Sequoia&zwnj; 15.1 introduces the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/29/ios-18-1-apple-intelligence-features/">first Apple Intelligence features</a>, adding support for Writing Tools, new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a> features, Smart Replies in Mail and Messages, Priority messages in the Mail app, Memory Movie and Clean Up in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/photos/">Photos</a>, and more.<br/>
<br/>
The update <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/29/ios-18-1-apple-intelligence-unavailable-features/">does not include</a> Image Playground, Genmoji, or more advanced &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; functionality.<br/>
<br/>
Using Apple Intelligence features requires a Mac that has an Apple silicon chip.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Update:</b> There appears to be an issue with Apple's servers at the current time, and users could run into errors with updating and restoring Apple devices. Retrying multiple times works for some, but it may be worth waiting until the servers are fixed to download the update. <br/>

This latest Beats x Kim collaboration follows previous ones for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/08/16/beats-fit-pro-kim-kardashian-colors-launch/">Beats Fit Pro back in 2022</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/15/kim-kardashian-beats-studio-pro/">Beats Studio Pro just two months ago</a>, but while the two previous campaigns have focused on skin-tone colors, the new Beats Pill collaboration keeps the neutral color theme but goes for gray shades.<blockquote>"I'm excited to be back with my Beats family and to bring two new colors to an iconic product," said Kim Kardashian. "Music is a big part of my everyday life, from morning gym sessions to creative brainstorms, and the Beats Pill makes it that much more beautiful."</blockquote>The launch includes a new ad campaign featuring Kardashian and comedian Ben Marshall of comedy group Please Don't Destroy and Saturday Night Live as her "Pill Assistant" to carry the speaker around and curate playlists for her every need.<br/>

Compared to the Beats Pill+ that was discontinued in 2022, the revamped Beats Pill features a redesigned speaker system with a 20º upward tilt for better sound projection, a removable lanyard, USB-C connectivity to go along with Bluetooth support, up to 24 hours of battery life, and IP67 water and sweat resistance.<br/>
<br/>
Amplify Mode and Stereo Mode let you sync up two Beats Pill speakers for either bigger overall sound or separate left and right channels, while USB-C support means you can charge a recent <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> or other devices from the speaker. The Beats Pill can also be used as a speakerphone for connected devices, with a noise-learning algorithm and full duplex support ensuring high-quality calls.<br/>

The Beats x Kim Beats Pill launches this Friday, October 18, at 7:00 am Pacific Time, and it will be available for the same &#36;149.99 price as standard models of the portable speaker. It will be <a href="http://apple.com/beatsxkimpill">available from Apple's online store</a> in the US, Canada, UK, Germany, France, Australia, China, Hong Kong, Japan, Singapore, Thailand, and Korea, and at select Apple retail stores in all of those countries with the exception of Korea.

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/15/apple-unveils-new-ipad-mini-apple-intelligence/">introduced the iPad mini 7</a> with a faster A17 Pro chip, Apple Intelligence support, and Apple Pencil Pro support. In addition, the device also received a handful of smaller upgrades and changes compared to the previous model, as outlined below.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/10/ipad-mini-7-feature.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-970887" /><br/>
The new iPad mini can be ordered starting today, and it launches on Wednesday, October 23.<br/>
<br/>
Here are six of the device's smaller changes.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Faster USB-C Port</h2><br/>
<br/>
Apple says the USB-C port on the iPad mini 7 is capable of data transfer speeds of up to 10 Gbps, which is double the 5 Gbps limit on the iPad mini 6.<br/>
<br/>
This upgrade allows for faster data transfer over a USB-C cable, for tasks such as exporting photos from the iPad mini to a Mac.<br/>
<br/>
Here are the USB-C and Thunderbolt speeds for all recent iPad models:<br/>
<br/>
<table class="comparison"><br/>
 <tr><br/>
 <th>Device</th><br/>
 <th>Specification</th><br/>
 </tr><br/>
 <tr><br/>
 <td><div class="center-wrap">iPad Pro (2021 and later)</div></td><br/>
 <td><div class="center-wrap">Thunderbolt (Up to 40 Gbps)</div></td><br/>
 </tr><br/>
 <tr><br/>
 <td><div class="center-wrap">iPad Pro (2018 and 2020)</div></td><br/>
 <td><div class="center-wrap">USB 3.1 Gen 2 (Up to 10 Gbps)</div></td><br/>
 </tr><br/>
 <tr><br/>
 <td><div class="center-wrap">iPad Air (2022 and later)</div></td><br/>

 <td><strong><div class="center-wrap">iPad mini (2024)</div></strong></td><br/>

 <tr><br/>
 <tr><br/>
 <td><div class="center-wrap">iPad mini (2021)</div></td><br/>
 <td><div class="center-wrap">USB 3.1 Gen 1 (Up to 5 Gbps)</div></td><br/>
 </tr><br/>
 <tr><br/>
 <td><div class="center-wrap">iPad (2022)</div></td><br/>
 <td><div class="center-wrap">USB 2.0 (Up to 480 Mbps)</div></td><br/>
 </tr><br/>
</table><br/>
<div class="clear"></div><br/>
<br/>
<h2>eSIM Only</h2><br/>
Following in the footsteps of the iPad Pro and iPad Air, cellular models of the iPad mini no longer have a nano-SIM card slot worldwide. Unlike the iPad mini 6, the iPad mini 7 relies entirely on digital eSIM technology for cellular data plans.<br/>
<br/>
Apple has a <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/119592">support document</a> with helpful information about using an eSIM on an iPad.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Faster Wi-Fi</h2><br/>
Like many other recent Apple devices, the iPad mini 7 supports faster Wi-Fi 6E.<br/>
<br/>
Wi-Fi 6E extends the capabilities of the regular Wi-Fi 6 specification to the 6 GHz band, enabling faster wireless speeds and reduced signal interference. In addition to the iPad mini 7, you will need a router with Wi-Fi 6E support.<br/>
<br/>
iPad mini 7 also supports Bluetooth 5.3.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Double the Base Storage</h2><br/>
iPad mini 7 starts with 128GB of storage, compared to 64GB for the iPad mini 6. Better yet, the iPad mini continues to start at &#36;499.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Improved HDR Photos</h2><br/>
The new iPad mini supports Smart HDR 4, whereas the previous model supports Smart HDR 3.<br/>
<br/>
Apple says Smart HDR 4 makes photos look "even more detailed and vivid."<br/>
<br/>
Here is how Apple previously described Smart HDR 4:<blockquote>Introduced with iPhone 13 Pro and iPhone 13, Smart HDR 4 uses intelligent segmentation to apply different adjustments for colour, contrast, and noise to the subject versus the background. This ensures faces are properly exposed in challenging lighting, and renders people in the same photo individually, with different adjustments optimized for lighting and skin tone for each person.</blockquote><br/>
<h2>"iPad mini" Inscription</h2><br/>
As noted by Parker Ortolani, the iPad mini 7 has an "iPad mini" inscription on the back of device. Previous models of the device merely show "iPad."<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">teeny tiny detail, but the new iPad mini now actually says &quot;mini&quot; on the back like the other models from the past few years that got their modifiers added <a href="https://t.co/EjSEqvJ4PE">pic.twitter.com/EjSEqvJ4PE</a></p>&mdash; Parker Ortolani (@ParkerOrtolani) <a href="https://twitter.com/ParkerOrtolani/status/1846203130020528253?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 15, 2024</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div><div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-mini/">iPad mini</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPad_Mini">iPad Mini (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipad.137">iPad</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/15/ipad-mini-7-smaller-changes/">iPad Mini 7 Has These 6 Smaller Changes, Including a Faster USB-C Port</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ipad-mini-7-has-these-6-smaller-changes-including-a-faster-usb-c-port.2440126/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Today we're tracking a pair of <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0CM5JLWJK%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1">discounts on Apple's 14-inch M3 MacBook Pro</a> at Amazon and Best Buy. These deals include &#36;300 off original prices of the 512GB and 1TB models, and both match the all-time low price on each model.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/08/macbook-pro-blue-green.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-962220" /><em><small>Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with some of these vendors. When you click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment, which helps us keep the site running.</small></em><br/>
<br/>
Starting with the 512GB 14-inch M3 MacBook Pro, you can get this computer for <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0CM5JLWJK%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"><strong>&#36;1,299.00</strong></a> at Amazon, down from &#36;1,599.00. <a href="https://howl.me/cniYaR5CfDF">Best Buy is matching</a> the same deal, and both retailers have the Silver and Space Gray colors available at this price.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0CM5JLWJK%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"target="_blank"><div class="fancybutton"><div class="fancybadge">&#36;300 OFF</div>14-inch M3 MacBook Pro (512GB) for &#36;1,299.00</div></a></div><br/>
<br/>
Secondly, Amazon has the 1TB 14-inch M3 MacBook Pro for <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0CM5KC8X7%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"><strong>&#36;1,499.00</strong></a>, down from &#36;1,799.00. Again, you'll find the same price <a href="https://howl.me/cniYa8oeaLI">matched at Best Buy</a>, and this is another all-time low price on the M3 MacBook Pro at both retailers.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0CM5KC8X7%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"target="_blank"><div class="fancybutton"><div class="fancybadge">&#36;300 OFF</div>14-inch M3 MacBook Pro (1TB) for &#36;1,499.00</div></a></div><br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/15/apple-unveils-new-ipad-mini-apple-intelligence/">today revealed</a> the seventh-generation <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-mini/">iPad mini</a>, introducing several significant upgrades that make it a standout from its predecessor. Here's everything that's new.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/10/iPad-mini-6-vs-7-Feature-1.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-970863" /><br/>
At the core of the new device is the A17 Pro chip, first introduced last year in the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a> Pro, which delivers faster CPU and GPU performance along with advanced graphics features like hardware-accelerated ray tracing. One of the most important additions is support for Apple Intelligence, unlocking new AI-driven features that could dramatically improve user experience. It's also worth noting that the device now starts with 128GB of storage, double the previous base capacity, with no increase in price. <br/>
<br/>
The seventh-generation &zwnj;iPad mini&zwnj; also boasts a faster USB-C port for quicker data transfers, Smart HDR 4 for better photo quality, and support for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-pencil/">Apple Pencil</a> Pro with hover functionality for greater precision. A new Blue color also replaces Pink in the lineup. All of the differences between the sixth- and seventh-generation &zwnj;iPad mini&zwnj; models are listed below:<br/>

<div class="clear"></div><br/>
<br/>
The seventh-generation &zwnj;iPad mini&zwnj; offers several noteworthy upgrades, but whether you should buy the new model depends on your specific needs and how you plan to use your device. The most significant change is the move to the A17 Pro chip, which brings a notable performance boost across the CPU, GPU, and Neural Engine. This improvement is important for power users who rely on their <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> for demanding tasks such as creative work or intensive multitasking. The addition of hardware-accelerated ray tracing and mesh shading also enhances graphics performance, which is ideal for mobile gamers.<br/>
<br/>
Apple Intelligence support is another major feature that introduces a wide array of AI functionalities such as notification summaries, writing tools, image and emoji generation, and a revamped version of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a> that integrates ChatGPT and on-screen awareness and the ability to take action. This could be transformative for those who use their &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; for productivity.<br/>
<br/>
The seventh-generation &zwnj;iPad mini&zwnj; also gains &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; hover and &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; Pro support, offering more precise control for drawing, writing, and graphic design. These upgrades make the new &zwnj;iPad mini&zwnj; particularly attractive for artists and professionals who use the &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; extensively. The new USB-C 3.0 port offers twice the data transfer speed of the sixth-generation &zwnj;iPad mini&zwnj;, making it a meaningful upgrade for users who frequently transfer large files between devices.<br/>
<br/>
The improved Smart HDR 4 for photos and new True Tone flash enhances camera performance. While not revolutionary, it's a good improvement for those who use their &zwnj;iPad mini&zwnj; for photography and document scanning. Finally, the fresh Blue color adds a subtle aesthetic update, but of course, this is a matter of personal preference.<br/>
<br/>
If you're a power user—someone who relies on their &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; for heavy multitasking, professional work with the &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj;, or intensive graphics and gaming—the seventh-generation &zwnj;iPad mini&zwnj;'s improvements in speed, Apple Intelligence support, and Pencil support could make a noticeable difference to your workflow and justify an upgrade.<br/>
<br/>
For users intending to use their &zwnj;iPad mini&zwnj; for browsing, light productivity, streaming, and casual gaming, the improvements in the seventh generation may not feel as impactful. The core experience of iPadOS and apps will remain largely the same, with only moderate gains in speed and efficiency. If the sixth-generation &zwnj;iPad mini&zwnj; still handles all your needs—especially if you don't push it to its performance limits—the improvements in the seventh generation might not feel essential.<br/>
<br/>
The A15 Bionic chip is still more than capable for everyday tasks, and unless you require faster data transfers, better &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; control, or Apple Intelligence for productivity, the new features may not justify the cost of upgrading. If you are one of these users and you do not currently own an &zwnj;iPad mini&zwnj;, it may be worth picking up a now-discontinued sixth-generation model for a heavily discounted price. <div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-mini/">iPad mini</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPad_Mini">iPad Mini (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipad.137">iPad</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ipad-mini-6-vs-7/">iPad Mini 6 vs. iPad Mini 7 Buyer&#039;s Guide: 20 Upgrades Compared</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ipad-mini-6-vs-ipad-mini-7-buyers-guide-20-upgrades-compared.2440120/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[OPPO's upcoming Find X8 series will include a pressure-sensitive camera shutter button that resembles Apple's new Camera Control feature introduced with the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/10/oppo-find-x8-series.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-970814" /><br/>
The &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj;'s Camera Control is a pressure-sensitive button allows users to interact with the camera in ways that were previously only possible with on-screen gestures and can perform functions such as launching the camera, taking pictures, switching between cameras, and zooming in. Chinese smartphone maker OPPO recently confirmed that its upcoming Find X8 series will feature a similar camera shutter button (via <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/oppo-find-x8-camera-button-iphone-3490115/"><em>Android Authority</em></a>).<br/>
<br/>
OPPO's product manager, Zhou Yibao, revealed on the Chinese social media platform Weibo that the Find X8 series will include a pressure-sensitive button designed to streamline camera controls. According to Zhou, the button will allow users to quickly launch the camera app with a double-tap and swipe to zoom, with clear parallels to Apple's implementation. Zhou also pointed out that the camera button on OPPO's device has been specifically designed for underwater use.<br/>

<br/>
Vivo's recently launched X200 series also exhibits similarities to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>, boasting 4K video recording at 120 frames per second and cinematic slow-motion video capture—features that align closely with those recently introduced in Apple's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/">iPhone 16 Pro</a> models. The X200 also supports <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/live-photos/">Live Photos</a> that are compatible with the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
Vivo's X200 series also introduces "Origin Island," a dynamic interface feature that bears a striking resemblance to Apple's "<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/dynamic-island/">Dynamic Island</a>" on the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;. Much like Apple’s implementation, Origin Island provides real-time notifications, multitasking capabilities, and cross-app operations within a single interactive space.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[The FIDO Alliance is developing new specifications to enable secure transfer of passkeys between different password managers and platforms. <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/fido-alliance-publishes-new-specifications-to-promote-user-choice-and-enhanced-ux-for-passkeys/">Announced on Monday</a>, the initiative is the result of collaboration among members of the FIDO Alliance's Credential Provider Special Interest Group, including Apple, Google, Microsoft, 1Password, Bitwarden, Dashlane, and others.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/08/ios-16-passkeys-websites.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-857355" /><br/>
Passkeys are an industry standard developed by the FIDO Alliance and the World Wide Web Consortium, and were integrated into Apple's ecosystem with iOS 16, iPadOS 16.1, and macOS Ventura. They offer a more secure and convenient alternative to traditional passwords, allowing users to sign in to apps and websites in the same way they unlock their devices: With a fingerprint, a face scan, or a passcode. Passkeys are also resistant to online attacks like phishing, making them more secure than things like SMS one-time codes.<br/>
<br/>
The draft specifications, called Credential Exchange Protocol (CXP) and Credential Exchange Format (CXF), will standardize the secure transfer of credentials across different providers. This addresses a current limitation where passkeys are often tied to specific ecosystems or password managers.<br/>
<br/>
For Apple users, the development could significantly enhance the utility of passkeys across their devices and services. Once implemented, users may be able to securely move their passkeys between Apple's built-in password management system and third-party password managers, and event to non-Apple platforms. It's worth noting that the new specifications are currently open for community review and feedback, so it could be a while before we see them implemented and the specifications could change in the meantime.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/passkeys/">Passkeys</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/15/fido-alliance-portable-passkeys-across-platforms/">FIDO Alliance Working on Making Passkeys Portable Across Platforms</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/fido-alliance-working-on-making-passkeys-portable-across-platforms.2440108/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's 2026 iPhones will use TSMC's next-generation 2-nanometer fabrication process in combination with a new packaging method that will integrate 12GB of RAM, a reputable source of accurate predictions about Apple's plans has claimed.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/10/Apple-Silicon-Teal-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-767478" /><br/>
In a <a href="https://weibo.com/1833340431/OBysCwunm">Weibo post</a> on Tuesday, Chinese-language user "Phone Chip Expert" said Apple's A20 chip in iPhone 18 models will switch from the previous InFo (Integrated Fan-Out) packaging to WMCM (Wafer-Level Multi-Chip Module) packaging, while memory will be upgraded to 12GB.<br/>
<br/>
In terms of the differences in packaging method, InFo allows integration of components, including memory, within the package but focuses more on single-die packaging where memory is typically attached to the main SoC (such as DRAM placed on top or near the CPU and GPU cores). It's optimized for reducing the size and improving the performance of individual chips.<br/>
<br/>
WMCM, on the other hand, excels at integrating multiple chips within the same package (hence the "Multi-Chip Module" part). This method allows more complex systems, such as CPUs, GPUs, DRAM, and other custom accelerators (e.g., AI/ML chips) to be tightly integrated in one package. It provides greater flexibility in arranging different types of chips, stacking them vertically or placing them side by side, while also optimizing communication between them.<br/>
<br/>
As for memory, all current iPhone 16 models feature 8GB of RAM, which is considered to be the minimum requirement for Apple Intelligence. <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/28/kuo-12gb-ram-iphone-17-pro-max-exclusive/">Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo</a> has said he expects next year's iPhone 17 Pro to feature 12GB of RAM, so it could be that Apple will make it a new standard across the succeeding iPhone 18 series. <br/>
<br/>
Having said that, Kuo also believes that only "Pro" models in the iPhone 18 series are likely to use TSMC's next-generation 2nm processor technology <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/19/kuo-iphone-17-3nm-chips/">because of cost concerns</a>. Meanwhile, it's not clear whether the fabrication tech and the memory size are indelibly intertwined in Apple's plans. <br/>
<br/>
<h2>Nanometer Generations</h2><br/>
Terms like "3nm" and "2nm" describe generations of chip manufacturing technology, each with its own set of design rules and architecture. As these numbers decrease, they generally indicate smaller transistor sizes. Smaller transistors allow more to be packed onto a single chip, typically resulting in increased processing speed and improved power efficiency. This year's iPhone 16 series is based on an A18 chip design built using a second-generation "N3E" 3nm process.<br/>
<br/>
TSMC plans to start manufacturing 2nm chips in late 2025, and Apple is expected to be the first company to receive chips built on the new process. TSMC generally builds new fabs when it needs to increase production capacity to handle significant orders for chips, and TSMC is expanding in a major way for 2nm technology.<br/>
<br/>
The leaker "Phone Chip Expert" has a track record of accurate predictions. They were first to correctly reveal  that the standard iPhone 14 models would continue to use the A15 Bionic chip, while the more advanced A16 chip would be exclusive to the ‌iPhone 14‌ Pro models. More recently, they were the first source of information about Apple developing its own <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/23/apple-developing-its-own-ai-server-processor/">AI server processor using TSMC's 3nm process</a>, targeting mass production by the second half of 2025.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/2nm/">2nm</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/phone-chip-expert/">Phone Chip Expert</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/15/iphone-18-enhanced-2nm-chip-12gb-ram/">iPhone 18 to Use Enhanced 2nm Chip Tech Integrating 12GB RAM</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-18-to-use-enhanced-2nm-chip-tech-integrating-12gb-ram.2440100/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Following an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/23/beats-studio-pro-matte-white-amazon/">Amazon-exclusive Matte White version</a> of the Beats Studio Pro that launched last month, Best Buy recently debuted its own exclusive color option for the over-ear headphones from the Apple-owned brand: <a href="https://howl.me/cnixvquwBqJ">Black & Gold</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/10/beats-studio-pro-bb-black-gold.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-970754" /><br/>
Offering a two-tone alternative to the standard Black color option, the Black & Gold Beats Studio Pro feature a largely black exterior but with something of a champagne or gold color inside the headband and all the way down to where the ear cups attach. Gold accents for the headband hinges and the Beats "b" button provide additional contrast.<br/>
<br/>
The Black & Gold Beats Studio Pro come with the same traditional black nylon case as the original four launch colors for the headphones, and they come with gray USB-C and 3.5mm cables for charging and connectivity.<br/>
<br/>
The <a href="https://howl.me/cnixvquwBqJ">new Black & Gold color option for the Beats Studio Pro</a> retails for the usual Studio Pro price of &#36;349.99, although Best Buy is currently running a <a href="https://howl.me/cnixvqJN4cc">significant sale on most Beats headphones and earphones</a> that knocks &#36;100 off to bring the price to &#36;249.99.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today seeded the fifth betas of upcoming watchOS 11.1, visionOS 2.1, and tvOS 18.1 updates to developers for testing purposes. The fifth betas come a week after Apple released the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/07/apple-seeds-watchos-11-1-beta-4/">fourth betas</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/10/Generic-Betas-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-970784" /><br/>
watchOS 11.1 can be installed by going to the Apple Watch app and selecting the Software Update section under "General" in Settings. tvOS 18.1 can be downloaded and installed through the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a> Settings app, and visionOS 2.1 can be installed by going to the Software Update section of the Settings app on the Vision Pro and opting into Beta Updates.<br/>
<br/>
So far, no major new features have been discovered in these three updates, though there are undoubtedly some minor feature tweaks and bug fixes that we'll learn about when Apple's release notes become available.<br/>
<br/>
These betas are accompanied by iOS 18.1 and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sequoia/">macOS Sequoia</a> 15.1, which will introduce Apple Intelligence. There are no Apple Intelligence features in watchOS, tvOS, and visionOS as of yet.<br/>
<br/>
While we don't always know what's included in minor watchOS, tvOS, and visionOS updates, we inform <em>MacRumors</em> readers when updates are available so those who are developers can download new software upon release.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/visionos-2/">visionOS 2</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/watchos-11/">watchOS 11</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_TV">Apple TV (Don't Buy)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-tv-and-home-theater.100">Apple TV and Home Theater</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-vision-pro.209">Apple Vision Pro</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-watch.172">Apple Watch</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/14/apple-seeds-fifth-beta-watchos-11-1/">Apple Seeds Fifth Betas of watchOS 11.1, visionOS 2.1, and tvOS 18.1 to Developers</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-seeds-fifth-betas-of-watchos-11-1-visionos-2-1-and-tvos-18-1-to-developers.2440050/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>
