		<description><![CDATA[With the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/25/apple-releases-watchos-10-1/">watchOS 10.1 update</a> that came out today, Apple has added Double Tap to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch/">Apple Watch Series 9</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch-ultra/">Apple Watch Ultra 2</a> devices. Double Tap was announced when the new models were introduced, but it took some time for Apple to implement it. With Double Tap, you can activate some Apple Watch functions with just one hand.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/Apple-Watch-Ultra-2-double-tap-gesture-230912-Faeture-Blue.jpg" alt="" width="1960" height="1102" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-915440" /><br/>
Using Double Tap requires you to tap your thumb and index finger together twice, and when you do this, you'll see a little icon on the Apple Watch to let you know that the tap was recognized. Double Tap uses the sensors in the Apple Watch to detect minute movements and blood flow when the fingers are positioned in a certain way. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/apple-watch-ultra-double-tap-feature-green.jpg" alt="" width="2210" height="1243" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-915455" /><br/>
There are a number of things you can do with Double Tap, and Apple has made it work with some of the most common actions that you might need to perform with one hand.<br/>
<ul><br/>
 	<li>Open the Smart Stack from the watch face, and then Double Tap again to scroll through widgets.</li><br/>
 	<li>Answer phone or <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/facetime/">FaceTime</a> calls.</li><br/>
 	<li>Hang up phone or &zwnj;FaceTime&zwnj; calls.</li><br/>
 	<li>When you get an iMessage, Double Tap to view it, and then Double Tap again if you need to scroll.</li><br/>
 	<li>Reply to a Message using dictation and then send it with Double Tap.</li><br/>
 	<li>Act on notifications - Apple says a Double Tap on an incoming notification will activate the primary action, such as snoozing a reminder or replying to a message.</li><br/>
 	<li>Pause, resume, and end a timer.</li><br/>
 	<li>Stop and resume the stopwatch.</li><br/>
 	<li>Snooze an alarm.</li><br/>
 	<li>Play and pause music, podcasts, or audiobooks (or skip a track, depending on settings).</li><br/>
 	<li>Change to the Elevation view in the Compass app.</li><br/>
 	<li>Start or stop automatic Workout reminders when a workout is detected.</li><br/>
<li>Take a photo with the Camera Remote.</li><br/>
<li>Record a voice memo in the Voice Memo app.</li><br/>
<li>Change Flashlight modes.</li><br/>
</ul><br/>
In the Apple Watch app under Gestures, you can opt to change the playback option from play/pause to skip, and the Smart Stack option from Advance (swaps through the widgets) to Select (opens a widget's associated app).<br/>
<br/>
While Double Tap can be used with third-party apps through incoming notifications, there is no Double Tap API for third-party apps at the current time. Developers can still customize their apps for Double Tap to an extent by assigning the action that should occur when a Double Tap gesture is used on an incoming notification.<br/>
<br/>
Double Tap is limited to the &zwnj;Apple Watch Series 9&zwnj; and the &zwnj;Apple Watch Ultra 2&zwnj; because, as Apple executives said in a <a href="https://www.tomsguide.com/features/apple-watch-9-how-apple-redefined-the-smartwatch">recent interview with <em>Tom's Guide</em></a>, the S9 chip in the new models is the first that is powerful enough for the gesture system.<br/>
<br/>
To use Double Tap, &zwnj;Apple Watch Ultra 2&zwnj; and &zwnj;Apple Watch Series 9&zwnj; owners will need to update their devices to watchOS 10.1 through the Apple Watch app on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>. watchOS 10.1 requires an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; running <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a> or later.<br/>
<br/>
Note that Double Tap <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT213942">will not work</a> when Low Power Mode, Sleep Focus, Theater Mode, or Water Lock is activated, and you must first raise your wrist to wake the Apple Watch to perform the gesture. Double Tap also does not work on watches that are paired as a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/family-setup/">Family Setup</a> watch.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/watchos-10/">watchOS 10</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-programming.135">Apple Programming</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/25/watchos-10-1-double-tap-gesture/">Everything You Can Do With the Double Tap Gesture on Apple Watch</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/everything-you-can-do-with-the-double-tap-gesture-on-apple-watch.2408671/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple plans to begin a major overhaul of its AirPods lineup starting next year, according to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-10-25/apple-airpods-plans-4th-generation-low-end-3rd-generation-pro-and-usb-c-max"><em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/08/airpods-school.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-905460" /><br/>
The standard AirPods and the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-max/">AirPods Max</a> will see a refresh in 2024, while the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/">AirPods Pro</a> will be updated in 2025. For the AirPods and &zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj;, Apple will update the design of the earbuds and the case, while also improving audio quality.<br/>
<br/>
When the AirPods are refreshed, Apple will phase out the second-generation and third-generation models, offering two fourth-generation models at different price points instead.<br/>
<br/>
Both of the fourth-generation AirPods models will look like a cross between the current AirPods and the &zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj;, with Apple introducing shorter stems. The higher-end version of the standard AirPods will feature Active Noise Cancellation, a feature that has thus far been limited to the &zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj; and the &zwnj;AirPods Max&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
Fit will be "improved," but it is unclear if Apple plans to add silicone ear tips. As for the case, it will gain speakers for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/find-my-network-accessory-program/">Find My</a> alerts, similar to the current &zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj;, and a USB-C charging port.<br/>
<br/>
The &zwnj;AirPods Max&zwnj; will see the inclusion of a USB-C port for charging purposes instead of a Lightning port, and Apple will also debut new colors. No other notable features are expected at this time.<br/>
<br/>
In 2025, the &zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj; will be updated with a new design and a faster chip, plus the earbuds could get some previously-rumored <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/12/gurman-airpods-to-gain-hearing-health-features/">hearing health features</a>. Rumors have suggested Apple is working on functionality that would let the &zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj; collect hearing data and better serve as a hearing aid replacement.<br/>
<br/>
There is no clear word yet on when in 2024 and 2025 we might see AirPod refreshes, but Apple typically introduces new models in the latter half of the year around when new iPhones come out. Gurman says that the AirPods will come out "later next year" and the &zwnj;AirPods Max&zwnj; will come out "around the end of next year."<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods/">AirPods 3</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-max/">AirPods Max</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/">AirPods Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/bloomberg-com/">Bloomberg</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AirPods">AirPods (Caution)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AirPods-Max">AirPods Max (Neutral)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AirPods-Pro">AirPods Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/airpods.216">AirPods</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/25/airpods-lineup-overhaul-2024/">New AirPods and AirPods Max Launching in 2024, Updated AirPods Pro Coming in 2025</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/new-airpods-and-airpods-max-launching-in-2024-updated-airpods-pro-coming-in-2025.2408657/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today released watchOS 10.1, the latest version of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/watchos-10/">watchOS 10</a> operating system that was <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/18/apple-releases-watchos-10/">released in September</a>. watchOS 10.1 comes four weeks after watchOS 10.0.2, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/26/apple-releases-watchos-10-0-2/">a minor update</a> that brought bug fixes.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/watchOS-10-Launch-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2560" height="1440" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-912513" /><br/>
‌&zwnj;watchOS 10&zwnj;‌‌.1 can be downloaded for free through the Apple Watch app on an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> running <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a> or later by opening it up and going to General &gt; Software Update. To install the new software, the Apple Watch needs to have at least 50 percent battery and it needs to be placed on a charger.<br/>
<br/>
There are several new Apple Watch features enabled in watchOS 10.1, including NameDrop. NameDrop lets you tap an Apple Watch to another Apple Watch or &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; to exchange contact information with someone.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/apple-watch-namedrop.jpg" alt="" width="3024" height="1640" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-911345" /><br/>
The update <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2023/10/apple-watch-double-tap-gesture-now-available-with-watchos-10-1/">also includes Double Tap</a>, a gesture that is available on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch/">Apple Watch Series 9</a> and the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch-ultra/">Apple Watch Ultra 2</a>. Double Tap can be activated by tapping the index finger and thumb together twice, and it can be used to answer phone calls, end phone calls, stop alarms, and more.<br/>
<br/>

Along with these two features, there are a handful of bug fixes, including an issue that could cause cities not to sync in the Weather app and a bug that could cause the elevation to be incorrect for some users. Apple's full release notes for the update are below.<br/>
<blockquote>watchOS 10.1 includes new features, improvements, and bug fixes, including:<br/>
<ul><br/>
 	<li>Double tap gesture can be used to perform the primary action in notifications and most apps so you can answer a call, play and pause music, stop a timer, and more (Available on Apple Watch Series 9 and Apple Watch Ultra 2)</li><br/>
 	<li>NameDrop allows you to exchange contact information with someone new by simply bringing your Apple Watch near their iPhone with iOS 17 or Apple Watch (Available on Apple Watch SE 2, Apple Watch Series 7 and later, and Apple Watch Ultra)</li><br/>
 	<li>My Card is available as a complication for quick access to NameDrop</li><br/>
 	<li>Fix for bug that causes the climate section in the Home app to be blank</li><br/>
 	<li>Addresses an issue that causes a white selection border to be unexpectedly displayed after turning off AssistiveTouch</li><br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today released the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod/">HomePod</a> 17.1 software for the &zwnj;HomePod&zwnj; and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod-mini/">HomePod mini</a>, bringing support for Enhance Dialogue to additional devices.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/01/HomePod-2-and-Mini-feature-2.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-882635" /><br/>
Enhance Dialogue is a feature that boosts the volume of spoken voices to make dialogue easier to hear over effects, action, and music in a movie or TV show. The feature works when a &zwnj;HomePod&zwnj; or &zwnj;HomePod mini&zwnj; is paired to an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a> and used as the audio output option.<br/>
<br/>
Prior to today, Enhance Dialogue was available on the second-generation &zwnj;HomePod&zwnj;, and it was a feature that was first introduced in tvOS 17. With tvOS 17.1 and &zwnj;HomePod&zwnj; software 17.1, Enhance Dialogue can be enabled on any &zwnj;HomePod&zwnj; (or set of HomePods) paired to an &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj; 4K. Apple's full release notes for the update are below.<blockquote>Software version 17.1 adds support for Enhance Dialogue on HomePod mini and HomePod (1st generation) so you can hear spoken voices more clearly over effects, action, and music in a movie or TV show when paired with Apple TV 4K. This update also includes bug fixes and stability improvements.</blockquote>Enabling Enhance Dialogue can be done by playing a TV show or movie, bringing up the playback controls with the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a> Remote, and choosing the Enhance Dialogue feature from the Audio Options button. It can be enabled for all content by going to Settings > Video and Audio > Enhance Dialogue.<br/>
<br/>
‌‌‌‌‌&zwnj;HomePod&zwnj;‌‌‌‌‌‌ software is installed automatically on the ‌‌‌‌‌‌&zwnj;HomePod&zwnj;‌‌ unless the feature is disabled‌‌‌‌, but the ‌‌‌‌‌‌&zwnj;HomePod&zwnj;‌‌‌‌‌‌ can also be manually updated in the Home app by following the instructions in our <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/homepod-software-update/">HomePod‌‌ update how to</a>.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod/">HomePod</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod-mini/">HomePod mini</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#HomePod">HomePod (Buy Now)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Homepod-Mini">HomePod Mini (Neutral)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/homepod-homekit-carplay-home-auto-technology.193">HomePod, HomeKit, CarPlay, Home & Auto Technology</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/25/apple-releases-homepod-software-17-1/">Apple Brings Enhance Dialogue to Original HomePod and HomePod mini With 17.1 Update</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-brings-enhance-dialogue-to-original-homepod-and-homepod-mini-with-17-1-update.2408655/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today released tvOS 17.1, the first major update to the tvOS 17 operating system that initially <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/18/apple-releases-tvos-17/">came out in September 2023</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-869857" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/10/Apple-TV-2022-Feature-Blue.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" /><br/>
tvOS 17.1 can be downloaded using the Settings app on the ‌<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a>‌. Go to System &gt; Software Update to get the new software. ‌&zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj;‌ owners who have automatic software updates activated will be upgraded to tvOS 17.1 automatically.<br/>
<br/>
The Enhance Dialogue feature first announced in tvOS 17 for the second-generation <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod/">HomePod</a> has expanded to the original &zwnj;HomePod&zwnj; and the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod-mini/">HomePod mini</a> in tvOS 17.1, though the HomePods will also need the &zwnj;HomePod&zwnj; 17.1 software that came out today.<br/>
<br/>
tvOS 17.1 also includes a new favoriting option in the Music app on the ‌&zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj;‌, along with some other minor Music changes.<br/>
<br/>
tvOS updates tend to be minor in scale, focusing on small features and bug fixes rather than notable outward-facing changes.

		<description><![CDATA[Apple may be planning to launch new Mac models announced at its "Scary Fast" event on Wednesday, November 8, <em>MacRumors</em> has learned.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/scary-fast-apple-event-feature.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-918418" /><br/>
At the start of the month, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/03/trade-in-changes-may-indicate-new-mac-this-month/"><em>MacRumors</em> reported</a> that Apple was proceeding with plans to announce at least one new Mac model in October. Apple yesterday <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/24/apple-october-mac-event-2023/">announced</a> its "Scary Fast" event for Monday, October 30, featuring a Finder hint, which virtually confirms the arrival of new Macs. Now, related information provided to <em>MacRumors</em> suggests that new Mac models could launch on Wednesday, November 8 – nine days after the "Scary Fast" event.<br/>
<br/>
While Apple product launches often take place on a Friday, there is precedent for Apple opting for the first Wednesday in November following an October event. For example, at its "There's more in the making" event on Tuesday, October 30, 2018, Apple announced new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a> models. The machines launched on Wednesday, November 7 – eight days later.<br/>
<br/>
Analyst <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/">Ming-Chi Kuo</a> says that Apple's upcoming event <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/24/kuo-m3-macbook-pro-october-30/">will focus on</a> new MacBook Pro models with M3 series chips, which could include the 13-, 14-, and 16-inch models with the M3, M3 Pro, and M3 Max chips. In addition to these machines, a new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/">iMac</a> featuring the M3 chip is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/22/gurman-apple-to-announce-new-macs-this-month/">also on the table</a> for announcement at the event.<br/>
<br/>
The M3 chip is widely expected to be fabricated using TSMC's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/3nm/">3nm</a> process for performance and efficiency improvements compared to the current, 5nm-based ‌<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m2/">M2</a>‌ chip, which debuted in June 2022. It will also likely feature an all new GPU with hardware ray-tracing, first introduced on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a>'s A17 Pro chip last month.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/october-2023-apple-event/">October 2023 Apple Event</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/25/new-macs-may-launch-on-november-8/">New &#039;Scary Fast&#039; Macs May Launch on Wednesday, November 8</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/new-scary-fast-macs-may-launch-on-wednesday-november-8.2408637/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today announced that it is increasing the prices of some of its subscription-based services, including Apple TV+, Apple Arcade, and Apple News+, for new and existing subscribers in the U.S. and <a href="https://www.macg.co/services/2023/10/augmentation-imminente-des-abonnements-apple-arcade-apple-tv-et-apple-one-140063">many other countries around the world</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/Apple-TV-Arcade-and-News-Price-Increase-Feature-2.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1404" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-918551" /><br/>
The price changes in the U.S. are as follows:<ul><li><strong>Apple TV+:</strong> &#36;6.99 per month → &#36;9.99 per month</li><br/>
<li><strong>Apple Arcade:</strong> &#36;4.99 per month → &#36;6.99 per month</li><br/>
<li><strong>Apple News+:</strong> &#36;9.99 per month → &#36;12.99 per month</li></ul>For those who subscribe to Apple TV+ on an annual basis, the price has increased from &#36;69 per year to &#36;99 per year accordingly.<br/>
<br/>
Prices for the Apple One bundles that include these services are also increasing as a result:<ul><li><strong>Individual:</strong> &#36;16.95 per month → &#36;19.95 per month</li><br/>
<li><strong>Family:</strong> &#36;22.95 per month → &#36;25.95 per month</li><br/>
<li><strong>Premier:</strong> &#36;32.95 per month → &#36;37.95 per month</li></ul>The price increases take effect immediately for new subscribers, and in 30 days from today for existing subscribers, on their next renewal date after that grace period. Apple should send out emails to existing subscribers notifying them about the changes over time, as it did following price increases to some services last year.<br/>
<br/>
In the U.S., these are the first-ever price increases for Apple Arcade and Apple News+ since the services launched in November 2019, while Apple TV+ had its first price increase from &#36;4.99 per month to &#36;6.99 per month <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/10/24/apple-price-increase-services/">in October 2022</a>.<br/>
<br/>
In a statement shared with <em>MacRumors</em>, Apple said it is "focused on delivering the best experiences possible for our customers by consistently adding high-quality entertainment, content, and innovative features to our services."<br/>
<br/>
There are no price increases for Apple Music and Apple Fitness+ today.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-news/">Apple News</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-arcade/">Apple Arcade</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-tv-plus/">Apple TV Plus</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-one/">Apple One</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/25/apple-services-price-increases/">Apple TV+, Apple Arcade, and Apple News+ Receiving Price Increases</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-tv-apple-arcade-and-apple-news-receiving-price-increases.2408634/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<title>Report: Apple Continues to Explore Health Capabilities of Vision Pro</title>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple has explored using its Vision Pro headset to diagnose and treat mental health problems, among other health monitoring capabilities, <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/apple-has-discussed-using-vision-pro-for-mental-health-diagnosis-treatment"><em>The Information</em></a>'s Wayne Ma reports.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/Vision-Pro-Person.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-913199" /><br/>
Citing sources with direct knowledge of the matter, Ma explains that Apple has experimented with using the Vision Pro to track a user's facial expressions to detect depression, anxiety, stress, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and other mental health issues. Specifically, eye-tracking, pupil dilation, and external cameras can measure a person's "affect," a psychological term that refers to how an individual expresses emotions.<br/>
<br/>
A so-called "flat affect," otherwise known as an emotionless facial expression, can be a sign of specific mental health difficulties. Upon detection of such a problem, the Vision Pro would then display relevant images and play sounds that could improve the wearer's mental state. Virtual reality headsets have already been used by researchers to diagnose and treat phobias and PTSD by safely exposing patients to their fears.<br/>
<br/>
Apple has also apparently discussed using the Vision Pro's infrared eye tracking-cameras to detect swelling in the blood vessels of the eyes to spot an early sign of heart failure. The company explored using the headset to detect weight changes and evaluate a user's movement over time, using this data to screen for health issues such as Parkinson's disease, but the feature had a major setback when Apple removed the full body-tracking capabilities from the Vision Pro due to unreliability.<br/>
<br/>
Features that claim to diagnose or treat health issues would need to undergo clinical studies and receive approval from health regulators before being released to the public, but some Apple employees are apparently concerned about the legal liability of making more health-related claims, which could limit the scope of the features. Other employees are said to be skeptical that the Vision Pro will be as effective as other methods of treatment, such as medicine.<br/>
<br/>
Teams and significant individuals inside Apple are said to have extensively discussed or explored health, wellness, and fitness features for the Vision Pro, including Mike Rockwell, the head of Apple's Vision Products Group. The company has reportedly hired health experts to explore features for the device. <em>The Information</em> was unable to learn whether mental health features will arrive on the first-generation Vision Pro headset, or if it will be reserved for future models. The sources added that such features may never launch at all, but the company continues to brainstorm health-related uses for the headset.<br/>
<br/>
Ma added that Apple has also explored the mental health detection capabilities of other devices such as the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>, using the front-facing camera to track a user's mood, as well as monitor app usage and typed words to detect early signs of Alzheimer's disease.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/theinformation-com/">The Information</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-vision-pro.209">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/25/apple-explores-vision-pro-health-capabilities/">Report: Apple Continues to Explore Health Capabilities of Vision Pro</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/report-apple-continues-to-explore-health-capabilities-of-vision-pro.2408633/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The first generation Apple Watch Ultra has hit a new all-time low price today on Amazon, available for <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0BDHT39HM%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1"><strong>&#36;629.00</strong></a>, down from &#36;799.00. The version on sale is the Titanium Case with Yellow/Beige Trail Loop in the S/M size.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/apple-watch-ultra-1-image.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-918496" /><em><small>Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with Amazon. When you click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment, which helps us keep the site running.</small></em><br/>
<br/>
There is another model on sale for slightly more at <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0BDHT6Q8V%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"><strong>&#36;659.00</strong></a>, but as of now these are the only first generation models of the Apple Watch Ultra on sale. This second device is the Titanium Case with Orange Alpine Loop.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0BDHT39HM%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1"target="_blank"><div class="fancybutton"><div class="fancybadge">&#36;170 OFF</div>Apple Watch Ultra for &#36;629.00</div></a></div><br/>
<br/>
We aren't tracking any all-time low prices on the new Apple Watch Ultra 2 at this time, with the steepest discount on Amazon measuring <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0CHX7J5Z3%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1">about &#36;25 off</a>. The second generation model is a very minor upgrade on the first generation device, so if your priority is saving money you'd do well to check out Amazon's sale on the original Ultra.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's upcoming <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/">iMac</a> refresh will feature a new chip, an internally redesigned stand, and a similar array of color options to the current model, according to <em>Bloomberg</em>'s <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/iMac-M3-Blue-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-917291" /><br/>
Following Apple's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/24/apple-october-mac-event-2023/">announcement</a> of its "Scary Fast" event scheduled for Monday, October 30, <a href="https://x.com/markgurman/status/1716872367631446288?s=20">Gurman reposted</a> a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2023-03-05/when-is-apple-aapl-releasing-new-mac-pro-15-inch-macbook-air-new-imac-m3-levgn4yc?sref=9hGJlFio">Power On newsletter</a> published in March on X (formerly Twitter) and reiterated several key details:<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Apple has been planning an M3 iMac for a while, with the machine going into production months ago. No other major changes other than the chip, but the stand’s internal design has been tweaked. I’d expect colors to remain similar. <a href="https://t.co/7nm7Zyq94b">https://t.co/7nm7Zyq94b</a></p>&mdash; Mark Gurman (@markgurman) <a href="https://twitter.com/markgurman/status/1716872367631446288?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 24, 2023</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div><br/>
<br/>
The main change to the &zwnj;iMac&zwnj; will apparently be its processor, with the new machine featuring Apple's M3 chip. The current model has the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m1/">M1</a> chip and Gurman has repeatedly said that the &zwnj;iMac&zwnj; will <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/07/06/no-m2-imac-on-the-horizon-for-2022/">skip the M2 chip entirely</a>. He previously remarked that he expects it to be "one of the company's first M3-based machines."<br/>
<br/>
Gurman mentioned the new &zwnj;iMac&zwnj;'s internally redesigned stand back in March, explaining that "the computer will see some of its internal components relocated and redesigned, and the manufacturing process for attaching the &zwnj;iMac&zwnj;'s stand is different." According to his latest comments, the internally redesigned stand remains on the new machine.<br/>
<br/>
The current, M1-based &zwnj;iMac&zwnj; is available in green, yellow, orange, pink, purple, blue, and silver. In March, Gurman said that the new &zwnj;iMac&zwnj; was being tested in orange, pink, blue, and silver finishes. Gurman has now reiterated his claim that the color options of the new machine will remain "similar," which suggests that there may still be some changes.<br/>
<br/>
The next-generation &zwnj;iMac&zwnj; is otherwise expected to be the same as the current 24-inch model. Gurman's information indicates that the new &zwnj;iMac&zwnj; entered mass production sometime between June and August, suggesting that it is now ready to launch.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/">iMac</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iMac">iMac (Don't Buy)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/imac.91">iMac</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/25/next-gen-imac-details-rumored-ahead-of-event/">Next-Generation iMac Chip, Stand, and Color Details Rumored Ahead of Apple Event</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/next-generation-imac-chip-stand-and-color-details-rumored-ahead-of-apple-event.2408626/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<title>Kuo: Apple Considering Low-Cost MacBook Launch in 2024</title>

		<description><![CDATA[Last month, a seemingly unlikely rumor out of Asia claimed that Apple could be planning to launch a low-cost MacBook series next year in order to compete with Google's popular and more affordable Chromebook models. On Tuesday, that rumor was revived by respected Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/10/apple-logo-backlit-mac.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1280" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-871954" /><br/>
A <em>DigiTimes</em> report in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/05/apple-low-cost-macbook-rival-chromebook/">September</a> said Apple could launch a more affordable MacBook line in late 2024 to differentiate it from the company's existing MacBook Air and Pro lines. Kuo now also <a href="https://x.com/mingchikuo/status/1716885306933411885?s=20">believes</a> Apple could be considering such a move to boost ailing MacBook shipments, with a target of 8-10+ million units per year. <br/>
<br/>
Kuo's prediction came in response to Apple's upcoming Mac event that was <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/24/apple-october-mac-event-2023/">announced</a> on Tuesday. The analyst suggested Apple's "Scary Fast" event on October 30 will <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/24/kuo-m3-macbook-pro-october-30/">focus on multiple M3 chips</a>, hinting at the possibility of M3, M3 Pro, and M3 Max variants. If Apple does release M3, M3 Pro, and M3 Max chips at once, they will likely feature in new 13-inch, 14-inch, and 16-inch MacBook Pro models.<br/>
<br/>
Kuo previously predicted that Apple would be unlikely to introduce new MacBook Pro models in 2023 because of "limited 4Q 23 shipments." He now says that if new MacBook Pros do come out in November or December, the tight supply will last until the first quarter of 2024.<br/>
<br/>
The analyst said Mac shipments have declined due to the "limited M2 computing power upgrade," which may be the reason why Apple is prepared to launch M3 MacBook Pro models with low production volume. "Theoretically, the M3 should offer a more significant boost in computing power," said Kuo, but if the M3 fails to boost shipments, that may trigger Apple's plan to introduce a "more affordable MacBook model."<br/>
<br/>
According to the original report out of Taiwan, Apple's more affordable MacBooks will adopt some design changes to enable Apple to achieve the low price. While the outer appearance will still use a metal casing to maintain the distinctive Apple Mac aesthetic, it could be made of "different materials." <br/>
<br/>
If Apple does unveil a low-cost Mac, it could potentially come in the form of a new 12-inch MacBook. Introduced in March 2015, the original 12-inch MacBook featured a thin and light design that weighed just two pounds, and was Apple's first notebook to feature a fanless design, USB-C port, and butterfly switch keyboard. Unfortunately, due to Apple's use of Intel Core M processors, many felt it was too underpowered to justify its &#36;1,299 price. Apple discontinued the model in 2019.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/07/12-inch-MacBook-side.jpeg" alt="" width="1200" height="630" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-853147" /><div class="center-wrap"><em>Apple's discontinued 12-inch MacBook</em></div><br/>
Reports about the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2020/08/31/12-inch-macbook-apple-silicon-this-year/">possibility of the 12-inch MacBook returning</a> have circulated ever since Apple adopted custom Apple silicon processors across its devices and began offering the M1 ‌MacBook Air‌ with a &#36;999 starting price. <br/>
<br/>
<em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman was <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">first</a> to spark serious rumors about Apple reintroducing a 12-inch MacBook model with Apple silicon, saying last year that the device could come at the end of 2023 or in 2024. In January 2023, Gurman said that a 12-inch MacBook was no longer on the company's near-term roadmap, but stopped short of ruling the device out completely, meaning that it being pushed into 2024 or later may still be possible.<br/>
<br/>
That was followed in February by another <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/02/15/apple-may-still-reintroduce-12-inch-macbook/">rumor</a> that Apple plans to bring the 12-inch MacBook back into its lineup. According to the report, production activities related to the device were ongoing, and Apple planned to decide whether to move forward with mass production as soon as the second half of this year. Whether this alleged activity relates to claims made by ‌<em>DigiTimes‌</em>, and now Kuo, about a low-cost MacBook remains to be seen.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/">Ming-Chi Kuo</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/25/kuo-apple-low-cost-macbook-launch-in-2024/">Kuo: Apple Considering Low-Cost MacBook Launch in 2024</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/kuo-apple-considering-low-cost-macbook-launch-in-2024.2408619/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[An image allegedly showing the box for a new unreleased MacBook Pro has emerged on Chinese social media platform Weibo.<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/alleged-m3-macbook-pro-box.jpeg" alt="" width="2048" height="1243" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-918435" /><br/>
The picture, re-shared on X by <a href="https://twitter.com/VNchocoTaco/status/1717105054287826967/photo/1">ShrimpApplePro</a>, shows what looks like Apple packaging featuring a MacBook Pro image with previously unseen wallpaper on the display. The wallpaper bears a passing resemblance to the one Apple used for the iPhone 15 Pro.<br/>
<br/>
It's unclear whether the image is legitimate or simply faked.<br/>
<br/>
Apple's upcoming <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/24/apple-october-mac-event-2023/">"Scary Fast" event</a> on October 30 will focus on the M3 series MacBook Pro models, according to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/24/kuo-m3-macbook-pro-october-30/">Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo</a>. <a href="https://twitter.com/markgurman/status/1716872016970854533"><em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman</a> also says that Apple has been testing M3 Max and M3 Pro MacBook Pro models, suggesting that these machines are going to be refreshed. <br/>
<br/>
Gurman just last week claimed that Apple would not update the 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models with M3 Pro and M3 Max chips until early 2024, so it seems that his predictions have since changed.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Scary fastest? <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/M3?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#M3</a> <a href="https://t.co/0YiRhCw8Ta">pic.twitter.com/0YiRhCw8Ta</a></p>&mdash; Tim Hardwick (@waxeditorial) <a href="https://twitter.com/waxeditorial/status/1716876571846586500?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 24, 2023</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div><br/>
In its <a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-events/?useASL=true">promotional graphics for the event on its website</a>, Apple has included the smiling Finder icon, essentially confirming that Macs are the focus of the event. <br/>
<br/>
Another hint that we should expect new MacBook Pro models is Apple's use of "Scary Fast" as a tagline: When Apple launched the first Apple silicon-based 14- and 16-inch MacBook Pro models in October 2021, the company's marketing <a href="https://x.com/waxeditorial/status/1716876571846586500?s=20">described</a> the M1 Pro as "Scary Fast" and the M1 Max as "Scary Faster."<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro/">MacBook Pro 14 & 16" </a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/shrimpapplepro/">ShrimpApplePro</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Pro_16">14" & 16" MacBook Pro (Caution)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macbook-pro.90">MacBook Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/25/alleged-macbook-pro-box-image/">Alleged New MacBook Pro Box Image Surfaces on China&#039;s Weibo</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/alleged-new-macbook-pro-box-image-surfaces-on-chinas-weibo.2408615/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple is expanding its Self-Service Repair and Independent Repair Provider programs and will make parts, tools, and documentation needed for product repairs available to repair shops and consumers nationwide.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-895789" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/05/Apple-Self-Service-Repair-Program-iPhone.jpeg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" /><br/>
The news was announced by the White House as part of an event focused on right to repair policies, and <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/apple-make-tools-parts-fix-phones-computers-available-nationwide-white-house-2023-10-24/">was shared by <em>Reuters</em></a>. Apple has not yet made a formal announcement, but more information is expected later today.<br/>
<br/>
The White House is aiming for a nationwide right to repair law, which Apple is endorsing. Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/11/california-right-to-repair-law/">recently supported</a> right to repair legislation in California because California's bill requires all repair parts to come from Apple. Third-party components must be disclosed by non-authorized repair shops.<br/>
<br/>
Apple has been offering a self-service repair program for consumers since 2022, providing genuine repair manuals, parts, and tools through its <a href="https://www.selfservicerepair.com/en-US/home">Self-Service Repair Store</a>. At the current time, Apple offers repair kits and parts for iPhones, Mac notebooks, Mac desktops, and Apple displays.<br/>
<br/>
Apple also <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2019/08/29/apple-independent-repair-program/">offers a similar repair program</a> for some independent repair shops, allowing them to source genuine parts to repair out-of-warranty Apple devices.<br/>
<br/>
Apple's Self-Service Repair Program is often more expensive than taking a device to an Apple retail location or Authorized Service Provider for repair, but it is a option for those who want to conduct their own repairs. Independent Repair Provider Program participants <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2020/02/06/apple-independent-repair-shops-contracts/">have also complained</a> about Apple's invasive contracts and high component prices.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/24/apple-expanding-device-repair-programs/">Apple Expanding Device Repair Programs for Consumers and Independent Shops</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-expanding-device-repair-programs-for-consumers-and-independent-shops.2408561/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple plans to overhaul the TV app in an effort to consolidate its <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-tv-plus/">Apple TV+</a> streaming service and its standalone movie and TV show purchase options, according to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-10-24/apple-to-revamp-tv-app-in-step-toward-simplifying-video-services"><em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman</a>. A tvOS update in December will introduce the changes that Apple has planned.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/10/Apple-TV-4K-hero-221018.jpg" alt="" width="1960" height="1306" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-869591" /><br/>
To push users to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a> app, Apple plans to remove its standalone &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj; apps that are available for renting and purchasing TV shows and movies. The movie and TV show sections from the iTunes Store app on iPhones and iPads will also be eliminated.<br/>
<br/>
Apple wants to push customers to the TV app, which already houses purchased movies and shows, &zwnj;Apple TV+&zwnj; content, and third-party channels that customers can subscribe to.<br/>
<br/>
The TV app will serve as a hub for streaming content, and Gurman says the redesigned app will have a side panel at the left that can be used to navigate between different video categories.<br/>
<br/>
Updated navigation should make the TV app less confusing for consumers, making it clearer which content is from Apple and available through the &zwnj;Apple TV+&zwnj; subscription and which content requires a separate subscription.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a></div><div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/bloomberg-com/">Bloomberg</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_TV">Apple TV (Neutral)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-tv-and-home-theater.100">Apple TV and Home Theater</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/24/apple-tv-app-revamp/">Apple to Overhaul TV App, Remove Standalone Apps from Apple TV</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-to-overhaul-tv-app-remove-standalone-apps-from-apple-tv.2408557/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's upcoming "Scary Fast" event will focus on the M3 series MacBook Pro models, according to <a href="https://twitter.com/mingchikuo/status/1716871328794620072">Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo</a>. Kuo's wording suggests that he is expecting multiple M3 chips rather than just a single M3 chip, hinting at the possibility of M3, M3 Pro, and M3 Max chips.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/07/macbook-pro-pink.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-904044" /><br/>
If Apple does release M3, M3 Pro, and M3 Max chips at once, we can expect to see the new chips introduced in 13-inch, 14-inch, and 16-inch MacBook Pro models. <br/>
<br/>
Kuo says that he previously predicted that Apple would not likely introduce new MacBook Pro models in 2023 because of "limited 4Q 23 shipments," and if new MacBook Pros do come out in November or December, the tight supply will last until the first quarter of 2024. Kuo <a href="https://twitter.com/mingchikuo/status/1716885306933411885">further says</a> that Mac shipments have declined due to the "limited <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m2/">M2</a> computing power upgrade," which may be the reason why Apple might launch M3 MacBook Pro models with low production volume. <br/>
<br/>
<a href="https://twitter.com/markgurman/status/1716872016970854533"><em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman</a> also says that Apple has been testing M3 Max and M3 Pro MacBook Pro models, suggesting that these machines are going to be refreshed. Gurman just last week claimed that Apple would not update the 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models with M3 Pro and M3 Max chips <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/16/four-new-macbooks-on-schedule-for-launch-in-2024/">until early 2024</a>, so it seems that his predictions have since changed. <br/>
<br/>
That Kuo and Gurman are both now suggesting that we'll see 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models at Apple's October event comes as a surprise because much of their prior information pointed toward a 2024 refresh for these devices. <br/>
<br/>
Gurman maintains that Apple will not refresh the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/">MacBook Air</a> models, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-mini/">Mac mini</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-studio/">Mac Studio</a>, or <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-pro/">Mac Pro</a> at this time, which leaves the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/">iMac</a>, 13-inch MacBook Pro, 14-inch MacBook Pro, and 16-inch MacBook Pro for the October event. As Gurman has previously pointed out, these are the machines that are facing extended shipping times in Apple's online store. <br/>
<br/>
According to Kuo, if the M3 models don't end up boosting MacBook shipments, there is an increased likelihood of an "all-new design MacBook Pro in 2025" and also a chance Apple will consider a "more affordable MacBook model."<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today released an iTunes 12.13 update for Windows users, with the update adding new functionality for podcasts and audiobooks.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-846163" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/05/itunes-for-windows.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" /><br/>
According to Apple's release notes, downloading iTunes 12.13 will allow Windows users to listen to podcasts and audiobooks through the iTunes app so long as the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/">Apple Music</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a> apps are installed.<br/>
<br/>
iTunes for Windows is not typically updated on a regular basis, and this is the first new software release <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/13/apple-itunes-for-windows-iphone-15/">since September</a> when Apple added support for new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a> models.<br/>
<br/>
iTunes has been phased out on the Mac for several years now and it has been replaced with Finder and the TV app, but Apple has continued to keep the Windows version available.<br/>
<br/>
iTunes for Windows can be downloaded from the <a href="https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/itunes/9PB2MZ1ZMB1S?hl=en-us&amp;gl=US">Microsoft Store</a> or <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT210384">from Apple's website</a>.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/itunes/">iTunes</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/mac-apps.2">Mac Apps</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/24/itunes-for-windows-12-13/">Apple Releases iTunes for Windows Update With Option to Listen to Podcasts and Audiobooks</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-releases-itunes-for-windows-update-with-option-to-listen-to-podcasts-and-audiobooks.2408549/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple Pay Later appears to have officially launched for all qualifying U.S. residents today, as it is now widely available in the Wallet app on the iPhone. The feature had been available on an invite-only "early access" basis <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/28/apple-pay-later-early-access/">since March</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/04/Apple-Pay-Later.jpeg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-893903" /><br/>
Apple removed the following sentence from all Apple Pay Later support documents today:<blockquote>Apple Pay Later is currently only available to customers invited to access a prerelease version.</blockquote>Apple Pay Later is a "buy now, pay later" feature that lets qualifying customers split a purchase made with Apple Pay into four equal payments over six weeks, with no interest or fees. The feature is available for eligible purchases between &#36;75 and &#36;1,000 made on an iPhone or iPad on most websites and apps that accept Apple Pay.<br/>
<br/>
The minimum purchase amount required to use Apple Pay Later was &#36;50 during the early access period, but Apple has now raised it to &#36;75.<br/>
<br/>
Every purchase made using Apple Pay Later is a separate loan and requires a new application, which has no impact on your credit score, according to Apple. The feature is available to U.S. residents who are 18 years of age or older. Apple Pay Later is currently unavailable in Hawaii, New Mexico, Wisconsin, and the U.S. territories.<br/>
<br/>
Apple Pay Later is part of the Wallet app on the iPhone, and found in the Settings app under Wallet & Apple Pay on the iPad. Users can view, track, and manage loans, with upcoming payments shown on a calendar and payment reminders sent via Wallet notifications and email. Users must set up a debit card as a loan repayment method.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple is preparing for the upcoming Mac-focused "Scary Fast" event that is set to take place on Monday, October 30 at 5:00 p.m. Pacific Time, and the company has added livestream placeholders both to the Events website and to YouTube.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ctkW3V0Mh-k" title="Apple Event - October 30" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><br/>
On <a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-events/?useASL=true">the Events website</a>, Apple has added an option to add the event to your calendar, and on YouTube, there is an option to get a reminder when the event begins. While the YouTube placeholder features a static Apple logo, Apple's Events website includes an animated logo that morphs into a Finder icon, hinting at the subject of the event.<br/>
<br/>
Apple has never held a worldwide event at night before, so this is a first for the company. The livestream will begin at 5:00 p.m. Pacific Time on the night before Halloween, which equates to 8:00 p.m. Eastern Time, 12:00 a.m. in the UK, 1:00 to 2:00 a.m. in much of continental Europe, and 9:00 a.m. in several countries in Asia.<br/>
<br/>
Given the late hour of the event, it will be online only, with no in-person component. The "Scary Fast" event will be able to be streamed via the Events website, on YouTube, and through the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a> app.<br/>
<br/>
<em>MacRumors</em> will have full coverage of the September 12 event as well, both on MacRumors.com and through our <a href="https://twitter.com/macrumorslive?lang=en">MacRumorsLive Twitter account</a>.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-event/">Apple Event</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/october-2023-apple-event/">October 2023 Apple Event</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/24/apple-scary-fast-event-livestream/">Apple Adds &#039;Scary Fast&#039; Event Livestream Placeholder to YouTube and Website</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-adds-scary-fast-event-livestream-placeholder-to-youtube-and-website.2408544/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>
