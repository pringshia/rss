		<description><![CDATA[It's hard to believe we're already into October with the iPhone 16 launch behind us, but there's lots more still to come from Apple this year on both the hardware and software fronts.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/10/top-stories-5oct2024.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-969553" /><br/>
We're still expecting a number of Mac and perhaps some iPad updates in the very near future, while Apple Intelligence features are set to begin rolling out with iOS 18.1 and related operating system updates. The train never really stops rolling though, as we're also looking ahead to a new iPhone SE and other updates in early 2025, so read on below for all the details on these stories and more!<br/>
<br/>
<h2>15 New Things Your iPhone Can Do in iOS 18.1</h2><br/>
iOS 18.1 is still in beta, but it's coming to all users later this month and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/27/new-things-your-iphone-will-do-ios-18-1/">will bring a number of new features and improvements</a> including the first Apple Intelligence capabilities for owners of the latest iPhone models. Other tweaks include fresh functionality for the Camera Control button on the iPhone 16 lineup and a much-desired ability to reset a customized Control Center layout.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/15-New-Things-Your-iPhone-Can-Do-in-iOS-18.1.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-968236" /><br/>
macOS Sequoia 15.1 is also on the way, and we've put together a similar <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/03/new-features-apple-intelligence-macos-sequoia-15-1/">overview of what you can expect to see in that update</a>, likewise headlined by Apple Intelligence features.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>What to Expect From an Apple Event in October: iPad Mini 7, Redesigned Mac Mini, and More</h2><br/>
With Apple's annual iPhone and Apple Watch event now in the rear-view mirror, we're still awaiting some updates to the Mac lineup.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/October-Event-Thumb-3.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-968718" /><br/>
We're <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/27/apple-event-october-2024-preview/">expecting some sort of event this month</a> where we're likely to see several M4-based Macs including a redesigned Mac mini, as well as a new iPad mini and perhaps a few other things.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Apple Releases iOS 18.0.1 With Touch Screen Bug Fix and More</h2><br/>
Ahead of the larger iOS 18.1 update coming later this month, Apple this week <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/03/apple-releases-ios-18-0-1/">released an iOS 18.0.1 update</a> with fixes for a number of bugs including touchscreen issues on the latest iPhone 16 models, camera freezes, and Messages app crashes.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/Generic-iOS-18.0.1-Feature-Real-Mock.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-968305" /><br/>
Also of note, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/03/apple-ipados-18-0-1-m4-ipad-pro/">iPadOS 18.0.1 finally allows owners of M4 iPad Pro models to update to iOS 18 once again</a> after Apple pulled the original release over two weeks ago due to device bricking issues.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>AirPods 4 With ANC vs. AirPods Pro 2</h2><br/>
Apple last month released the AirPods 4, and one version of the new earbuds has Active Noise Cancellation included. ANC means the ‌AirPods 4‌ have a feature set that rivals the AirPods Pro 2, so <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/28/airpods-4-vs-airpods-pro-2/">we thought we'd compare the two</a> for those undecided on which to get.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/AirPods-4-vs-Pro-2-Thumb-1.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-968527" /><br/>
You're not going to get the same level of ANC with the ‌AirPods 4‌ that you get with the ‌AirPods Pro‌ 2 because there's no sealing mechanism to block out noise, but the ‌AirPods 4‌ still perform impressively well.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>iPhone SE With Apple Intelligence, New iPad Air, and More Reportedly Launching 'Early Next Year'</h2><br/>
Looking beyond the new Macs coming later this year, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/01/new-iphone-se-and-ipad-air-early-2025-rumor/">early 2025 is expected to see the debut of several other new Apple products</a> including a fourth-generation iPhone SE, updated iPad Air models, and more, according to <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/iPhone-SE-4-Thumb-1.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-951978" /><br/>
The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/01/iphone-se-4-spring-2025-what-to-expect/">next iPhone SE is expected to be a notable upgrade</a>, moving from the legacy iPhone 8-style design with Touch ID Home button and large display bezels to an iPhone 14-like design with an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/03/apple-sourcing-iphone-se-oled-displays-report/">OLED display</a> and Face ID.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Apple May Launch First iPad-Like Smart Home Accessory Next Year</h2><br/>
Following a report last week from <em>9to5Mac</em> indicating that Apple's rumored iPad-like smart display for the home <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/26/apple-smart-home-accessory-square-display/">could feature a "squarish" display</a> with a launch targeted for next spring, <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman has confirmed that this is a simpler device than the one equipped with a robotic arm which has also been rumored.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/01/iPad-iOS-16-WP-Display-Feature-eric-edit.jpeg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-881759" /><br/>
This simpler device arriving as soon as next spring <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/30/apple-launch-smart-home-display-next-year/">would run a new "homeOS" platform</a> capable of running Apple apps like Calendar, Notes, and Home, and be "optimized for controlling home appliances and quickly seeing information."<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[A jury for the U.S. District Court for Western Texas on Friday found that the Secure Enclave built into modern Apple devices does not infringe four user verification patents owned by the company "Identity Security LLC," according to <a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/business-and-practice/apple-defeats-patent-infringement-lawsuit-over-iphone-security">Bloomberg Law</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/04/Beyond-iPhone-13-Better-Blue-Face-ID.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-793993" /><br/>
Apple introduced the Secure Enclave in 2013 in the iPhone 5s, the first iPhone with Touch ID, and it is now used in all iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple TV, Apple Watch, and HomePod models. Apple says the Secure Enclave is a secure subsystem within its chips that is designed to keep sensitive user data secure, including Touch ID and Face ID data.<br/>
<br/>
Identity Security LLC had <a href="https://insight.rpxcorp.com/litigation_documents/14227259">sued Apple</a> for patent infringement in 2021. It is not immediately clear if the company plans to appeal the jury's verdict.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Now that it's been two weeks since the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a> models were released, we've been able to spend enough time with the new devices to share a more in-depth review on their performance, battery life, feature set, and more.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NuUJ7V9vC04?si=NR21eC-mOYy8MJkM" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/macrumors?sub_confirmation=1">Subscribe to the MacRumors YouTube channel</a> for more videos.</em></div><br/>
We've been testing the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/">iPhone 16 Pro</a> and Pro Max, but the gap between the Pro models and the standard &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; models is narrower than usual this year. The Action button, Camera Control button, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/dynamic-island/">Dynamic Island</a>, and upcoming Apple Intelligence features are available across the lineup, which leaves fewer features to set the two <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> tiers apart and justify the cost of the Pro upgrade.<br/>
<br/>
You do get the 120Hz ProMotion display, the 5x Telephoto lens, upgraded 48-megapixel Ultra Wide lens, and slightly bigger displays with the &zwnj;iPhone 16 Pro&zwnj; and Pro Max, but many people are going to be happy with the standard &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; models.<br/>
<br/>
Camera Control is kind of a love it or hate it feature that takes some time to get familiar with. It makes opening the camera and snapping a photo much quicker, but getting used to adjusting settings with the button rather than the display takes a good amount of time to get used to. On the bigger iPhones, it's difficult to use the button one-handed, especially in portrait mode.<br/>
<br/>
Macro mode images are better and Photographic Styles and the customization that comes with them are great, but there isn't a lot of additional improvement to be seen with the cameras for photo taking. For videos, there's a 4K 120fps mode that can be adjusted later, and a new Audio Mix feature for adjusting video sound.<br/>
<br/>
The A18 Pro chip is fast, but so was the A17 Pro from last year, and you're not going to notice a difference in performance if you're coming from an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; released in the last couple of years. The benefit of the A18 Pro is support for both current and future Apple Intelligence features coming in the next few years. The first Apple Intelligence options will be released in October, and while those won't necessarily stress the chip, future image generation capabilities could take advantage of the additional power you get with the A18 Pro.<br/>
<br/>
Battery life has increased for all &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; models, and there is a noticeable difference in battery life with the Pro Max that many users will notice day-to-day depending on workload compared to older iPhones.<br/>
<br/>
If you got a new &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj;, let us know what you think of it now that a couple of weeks have passed.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/">iPhone 16 Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-16-Pro">iPhone 16 Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/04/iphone-16-pro-max-two-week-review/">Two Weeks With the iPhone 16 Pro Max</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/two-weeks-with-the-iphone-16-pro-max.2439177/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

Apple has <a href="https://www.apple.com/uk/retail/victoriasquare/">announced</a> that its store at the Victoria Square shopping center in Belfast will be permanently closed starting Tuesday, October 15. The company is opening a new store in the nearby Corn Market area on Friday, October 18.<br/>
<br/>
<em>MacRumors</em> reader <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DAl4Qd1OP-q/">Chris Ball shared a photo</a> of Apple's new store in Belfast earlier this week, but the company's logo remained covered at the time. Ball said the store is located on High Street in the city's central shopping district.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Amazon is hosting another Prime Day event this year, called <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fprimebigdealdays%2F">Amazon Prime Big Deal Days</a> and offering shoppers the first chance to save on holiday shopping from a major retailer. Similar to the first Prime Day, it will last for two days (October 8-9) and you can already find a large selection of early deals across Amazon's storefront, covering savings on tech, clothing, video games, groceries, and much, much more.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/10/Prime-Big-Deal-Days-Hero-3.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-969557" /><em><small>Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with Amazon. When you click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment, which helps us keep the site running.</small></em><br/>
<br/>
For our coverage, we're focusing entirely on Apple and Apple-related discounts that can be purchased during this 48-hour event on Amazon. As of today, this includes deals on AirPods, Apple Watch, iPad, and MacBook Air.<br/>
<br/>
As is typical for Prime Day deals, these markdowns are very time sensitive, so sales listed below may disappear fast, and new ones may appear even faster. With this in mind, we'll keep this article updated throughout the event, and keep an eye on the MacRumors front page as we'll be posting particularly great deals in separate articles this week.<br/>
<br/>
Lastly, and perhaps most importantly, Amazon Prime Big Deal Days requires you to have an <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Famazonprime%3Fref_%3Dnav_cs_primelink_nonmember">Amazon Prime membership</a> to take advantage of the discounts. Amazon Prime offers a one month free trial, and otherwise costs &#36;14.99 per month or &#36;139.00 per year.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>AirPods</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/10/airpods-prime-day.jpeg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-969576" /><br/>

		<description><![CDATA[The Action button, introduced with the iPhone 15 Pro models and now featured on all iPhone 16 models, offers users a customizable hardware button for quick access to various functions. With iOS 18, Apple has expanded its capabilities to include Control Center functions, which could potentially increase its utility for many users.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/iOS-18-Control-Center-Toggles-for-Action-Button-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-955224" /><br/>
Despite its versatility, user adoption of the Action button has been mixed. For example, in April 2024 a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/16/iphone-16-action-button-useful-or-not/"><em>MacRumors</em> survey of iPhone 15 Pro users</a> revealed that while some found the button a "game changer," particularly for activating custom Shortcuts, over half of respondents often forgot the button is even there. The most common uses among those who did use it included activating the camera or flashlight – functions already accessible via the default Lock screen.<br/>
<ul><li><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/customize-iphone-lock-screen-buttons/">How to Replace or Remove Lock Screen Camera and Flashlight Icons</a></li></ul><br/>
However, the new ability to assign Control Center functions to the Action button may change its reception, and could address common criticisms about its limited usefulness. By providing quick access to frequently used Control Center settings, it may solve the "out of sight, out of mind" problem and make the Action button more integral to your daily iPhone use. For those looking to give the Action button another chance or maximize its potential, here's how to set it up:<br/>
<ol><br/>
<li>Open the Settings app on your iPhone.</li><br/>
<li>Scroll down and tap <strong>Action Button</strong>.</li><br/>
<li>Swipe through the available actions until you reach <strong>Controls</strong>.</li><br/>
<li>Tap the chevrons next to "Choose a Control."</li><br/>
<li>Scroll through the Control Center options or use the search bar at the top to find a specific control.</li><br/>
<li>Tap on the desired control to assign it to the Action button.</li><br/>
</ol><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/10/action-button-controls.jpg" alt="settings" width="4377" height="2796" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-969562" /><br/>
<br/>
Some of the Control Center functions you can assign include Dark Mode, Airplane Mode, Cellular Data, Personal Hotspot, Quick Note, and Scan Code. Third-party app controls may also be available, depending on the apps installed on your device. Here's a full list of what's available:<div style="display: flex;"><ul style="flex: 1;"><br/>
    <li>Calculator</li><br/>
    <li>Stopwatch</li><br/>
    <li>Alarm</li><br/>
    <li>Home</li><br/>
    <li>Timer</li><br/>
    <li>Dark Mode</li><br/>
    <li>Airplane Mode</li><br/>
    <li>Cellular Data</li><br/>
  </ul><br/>
  <ul style="flex: 1;"><br/>
    <li>Personal Hotspot</li><br/>
    <li>Open Music</li><br/>
    <li>Quick Note</li><br/>
    <li>Remote</li><br/>
    <li>Scan Code</li><br/>
    <li>Wallet</li><br/>
    <li>Tap to Cash</li><br/>
    <li>Ping My Watch</li><br/>
  </ul><br/>
</div><br/>
<br/>
Looking at the above list, you may have noticed that not all Control Center toggles are available as Action button controls. For example, while you can assign cellular data control, Wi-Fi control is not an option. Weirdly, neither is Orientation Lock or Low Power Mode. Whether Apple plans to rectify these omissions in a future software update remains unclear. Regardless, you can still use Shortcuts to activate the missing functions. <br/>
<ul><li><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/iphone-15-pro-assign-two-shortcuts-action-button/">How to Assign Two Functions to the Action Button</a></li></ul><br/>
Once you've set up your preferred Control Center function out of those that are available, you can activate it by pressing and holding the Action button. This provides a convenient way to toggle features or access tools without navigating through menus or opening the Control Center.<br/>
<br/>

While some users may still find it challenging to incorporate the Action button into their daily usage, experimenting with different Control Center functions could help dial in just the right amount of muscle memory that reminds you it's there. <div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/">iPhone 16 Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/action-button/">Action Button</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/control-center/">Control Center</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-16">iPhone 16 (Buy Now)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-16-Pro">iPhone 16 Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/assign-control-center-iphone-action-button/">Assign Control Center Functions to Your iPhone&#039;s Action Button</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/assign-control-center-functions-to-your-iphones-action-button.2439169/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

While the ad is for the iPhone 16 Pro, the Camera Control is available on all four iPhone 16 models. The button provides quick access to the iPhone's camera, and you can press or swipe on it to adjust functions like zoom, depth of field, and more. In addition, an iOS 18 software update coming later this year will enable the Camera Control to automatically lock focus and exposure on a subject with a light press.<br/>
<br/>
All four iPhone 16 models launched in the U.S. and many other countries on September 20.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/">iPhone 16 Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-ads/">Apple Ads</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-16">iPhone 16 (Buy Now)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-16-Pro">iPhone 16 Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/04/iphone-16-camera-control-apple-ad/">Apple&#039;s Latest Ad Highlights iPhone 16&#039;s New Camera Control Button</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apples-latest-ad-highlights-iphone-16s-new-camera-control-button.2439163/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Following the introduction of the Apple Watch Series 10 and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/10/sleep-apnea-detection-details/">watchOS 11's new sleep apnea detection feature</a> last month, Apple executives Jeff Williams, Dr. Sumbul Desai, and Jay Blahnik sat down for an <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/tech/apple-interview-watch-anniversary-williams-desai-b2622562.html">interview with <em>The Independent</em>'s David Phelan</a>. The discussion is focused on the Apple Watch's health features.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/watchos-11-vitals.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-957264" /><br/>
Williams, who leads the Apple Watch engineering teams, said that Apple was inspired to add more health features to the Apple Watch after CEO Tim Cook received emails from customers who said the Apple Watch potentially saved their lives.<br/>
<br/>
"So, we realized, wow, we have this opportunity – and even more, a responsibility," said Williams. "So, we began to look for opportunities. That's when we started pulling on threads and adding additional sensors and features like irregular rhythm, atrial fibrillation alerts, and all the way through to something like sleep apnea."<br/>
<br/>
Williams added that his own sleep apnea diagnosis and subsequent usage of a CPAP machine to treat the condition provided him with "a new lease of life."<br/>
<br/>
"It was less about pushing any personal agendas – we don't really do that at Apple – but it certainly helps to have experience in terms of being able to reinforce and encourage the team that there's such an opportunity to help people," said Williams. "Everybody in the team is just really inspired by this mission of trying to help people with their health."<br/>
<br/>
Dr. Desai suggested that watchOS 11's new Vitals app that analyzes important health metrics during sleep could eventually work during the daytime too:<br/>
<br/>
"If we could push, over time, to get that type of information during the day, well, we always pull on the thread to see what else we can do," she said.<br/>
<br/>
Blahnik, who leads the teams behind Apple Fitness+ and other fitness technologies at Apple, emphasized the Apple Watch's utility for health and fitness.<br/>
<br/>
"It's easy to forget, but 10 years ago, you didn't really know how far you were running unless you happened to have measured the distance in your car, say," he said. "GPS on the wrist was not a common thing. How measuring your activity adds up to something over your life and your longevity is a big deal."<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Taiwanese company Novatek has announced plans to begin mass production of OLED displays with TDDI (touch and display driver integration) technology as early as the second quarter of 2025, supply chain publication <a href="https://www.digitimes.com/news/a20241004PD206/novatek-apple-tddi-ddi-taiwan.html"><em>DigiTimes</em> reported today</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/08/iPhone-17-Slim-Feature-Single-Camera-2.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-960528" /><br/>
The report states that Apple is "expected" to be one of Novatek's first customers, although this claim appears to be speculative.<br/>
<br/>
"While industry insiders remain tight-lipped about potential end customers, speculation suggests that Novatek's proposed shipping schedule could align with the next-generation iPhone displays in 2025," the report says. If this speculation proves to be accurate, at least some iPhone 17 models could adopt the technology next year.<br/>
<br/>
Given that TDDI technology would allow for Apple devices to have thinner OLED displays, through integration of the touch and display driver layers, the technology seems particularly fitting for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/23/iphone-17-slim-everything-we-know/">rumored ultra-thin "iPhone 17 Air."</a> <br/>
<br/>
It remains to be seen if Apple actually moves forward with adopting this technology. The report further speculated that Apple might first use it in lower-volume products compared to the iPhone, such as future iPad and Apple Watch models, and the technology would also be suitable for a long-rumored foldable iPhone or iPad.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17/">iPhone 17</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/digitimes-com/">DigiTimes</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/04/oled-tddi-iphones-rumor/">This Technology Could Pave the Way for the &#039;iPhone 17 Air&#039; Next Year</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/this-technology-could-pave-the-way-for-the-iphone-17-air-next-year.2439148/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

Apple's work on an iPad-like smart home display product has been reported for over a year. It is expected to serve as a smart home hub with features adopted from the ‌<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>‌, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod/">HomePod</a>, and the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a>, such as video playback and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airplay/">AirPlay</a>. Apple's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/04/leak-confirms-apples-work-on-home-accessory/">backend code suggests</a> it will feature the A18 chip and run a variant of tvOS like the &zwnj;HomePod&zwnj;, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/30/apple-launch-smart-home-display-next-year/"><em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman says</a> it will support Apple Intelligence and run Apple apps like Calendar, Notes, and Home, with an interface "optimized for controlling home appliances and quickly seeing information."<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's chip manufacturer TSMC and chip packaging company Amkor on Thursday <a href="https://ir.amkor.com/news-releases/news-release-details/amkor-and-tsmc-expand-partnership-and-collaborate-advanced">announced</a> that the two companies have signed a memorandum of understanding to collaborate on chip production, packaging, and testing in Arizona.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/04/apple-silicon-feature-joeblue.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-945652" /><br/>
In a press release, the two companies said that the close proximity of their facilities in Arizona will speed up the overall chip manufacturing process:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote>Under the agreement, TSMC will contract turnkey advanced packaging and test services from Amkor in their planned facility in Peoria, Arizona. TSMC will leverage these services to support its customers, particularly those using TSMC's advanced wafer fabrication facilities in Phoenix. The close collaboration and proximity of TSMC's front-end fab and Amkor's back-end facility will accelerate overall product cycle times.</blockquote><br/>
<br/>
Apple last year confirmed that <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/30/apple-amkor-chip-packaging-new-arizona-facility/">Amkor would package Apple silicon chips</a> produced at a nearby TSMC facility, as part of a shared desire to expand U.S. manufacturing. Tech journalist Tim Culpan recently reported that the TSMC facility had <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/18/apple-a16-chips-manufactured-arizona-tsmc-plant/">started small-scale production of the A16 chip</a>, which debuted in the iPhone 14 Pro models two years ago. The lower-end iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus models also use the A16 chip.<br/>
<br/>
Apple said Amkor would invest approximately &#36;2 billion in the project, and said it would employ more than 2,000 people upon completion.<br/>
<br/>
"Apple is deeply committed to the future of American manufacturing, and we'll continue to expand our investment here in the United States," said Apple's operations chief Jeff Williams, in a press release last November. "Apple silicon has unlocked new levels of performance for our users, enabling them to do things they could never do before, and we are thrilled that Apple silicon will soon be produced and packaged in Arizona."<br/>
<br/>
This partnership comes a little over two years after the U.S. government passed the CHIPS and Science Act, which provides funding to corporations, including TSMC and Amkor, to increase U.S. semiconductor research and manufacturing.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-silicon/">Apple Silicon</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tsmc/">TSMC</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/04/apple-chip-manufacturing-in-us-to-expand/">Apple Chip Manufacturing in U.S. to Expand Following New Partnership</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-chip-manufacturing-in-u-s-to-expand-following-new-partnership.2439142/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[WhatsApp is rolling out a new feature that allows users to tag other people in their Status updates, further enhancing the platform's Instagram Stories-like functionality. The addition aims to make it easier for users to connect with friends and family on the popular messaging app.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/10/whatsapp-status-user-tagging.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-969437" /><br/>
The new tagging feature enables users to mention up to five other WhatsApp accounts in their Status updates. When tagged, these users will receive a private notification and have the option to reshare the Status on their own account. WhatsApp says it has built in privacy controls, allowing users to tag someone without explicitly displaying their name in the Status.<br/>
<br/>
In addition to tagging, WhatsApp is also introducing a "like" feature for Status updates. Similar to Instagram Stories, users can now react to their friends' Status posts with a single tap, providing a quick way to acknowledge the content without sending a full message.<br/>
<blockquote>"WhatsApp Status is the best way to stay connected with friends and family and now we're making it even better," the Meta-owned company said in a <a href="https://blog.whatsapp.com/share-the-love-on-whatsapp-status">blog post</a>. "With status likes, private mentions and the ability to reshare a status you're mentioned in, we're making it easier to reach the people who matter most."</blockquote>The Status updates come on the heels of new video call effects, including filters and custom backgrounds, that were announced by WhatsApp <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/02/whatsapp-new-filters-backgrounds-video-calls/">earlier this week</a>. <br/>
<br/>
The effects allow users to apply 10 different filters and choose from 10 background options during video calls. Both the Status tagging feature and the new video call effects are rolling out to all WhatsApp users globally over the coming weeks.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/whatsapp/">WhatsApp</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/04/whatsapp-introduces-user-tagging-status-updates/">WhatsApp Introduces User Tagging in Status Updates</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/whatsapp-introduces-user-tagging-in-status-updates.2439128/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Spotify has <a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2024-10-03/offline-backup-keeps-the-music-going-when-your-connection-goes-missing/">announced</a> a new feature called Offline Backup, designed to give Premium subscribers an additional way to listen to music offline without manually downloading playlists. Rolling out globally this week, the feature aims to address situations where users find themselves without an internet connection and haven't prepared their offline music library in advance.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/10/spotify-offline-backup.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-969430" /><br/>
Offline Backup works by automatically creating a personalized playlist using tracks that have been recently streamed or queued, leveraging the cached content already stored on the user's device. Spotify says this approach allows listeners to access a selection of their favorite music without consuming extra data or storage space.<br/>
<br/>
The new feature promises flexibility by allowing users to filter and sort songs within the Offline Backup playlist by artist, mood, and genre. Spotify says the playlist will evolve over time based on listening habits, ensuring fresh content is always available.<br/>
<br/>
The development of Offline Backup followed successful user testing conducted last year, and the feature is now being made available to Premium subscribers on both Android and iOS platforms, including compatibility with Android Auto and Apple CarPlay.<br/>
<br/>
To access Offline Backup, users need to ensure they have listened to more than five songs recently and have enabled offline listening in their Spotify app settings. The playlist will appear automatically in the Home feed when the device is offline.<br/>
<br/>
Spotify recommends that users add the Offline Backup playlist to their library for quick access. Those unable to find the feature are advised to check that their Spotify app is updated to the latest version.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/spotify/">Spotify</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/04/spotify-launches-offline-backup-feature/">Spotify Launches Offline Backup Feature for Premium Users</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/spotify-launches-offline-backup-feature-for-premium-users.2439126/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today announced that its next quarterly earnings conference call will be held on Thursday, October 31 at 2 p.m. Pacific Time/5 p.m. Eastern Time.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/16-pro.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="898" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-964537" /><br/>
On the call, Apple's CEO Tim Cook and CFO Luca Maestri will discuss the company's earnings results for the fourth quarter of its 2024 fiscal year. It will likely be Maestri's final earnings call at Apple, as he will be succeeded by Kevan Parekh <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/26/apple-cfo-luca-maestri-stepping-down/">on January 1, 2025</a>. Maestri will continue to lead the Corporate Services teams at Apple.<br/>
<br/>
The call will be <a href="https://www.apple.com/investor/earnings-call/">streamed live on Apple's website</a>, and it should run approximately 60 minutes.<br/>
<br/>
Apple released these products in the quarter, which ran from June 30 through September 28:<br/>
<br/>
<ul><li>HomePod mini (Midnight)</li><br/>
<li>iPhone 16</li><br/>
<li>iPhone 16 Plus</li><br/>
<li>iPhone 16 Pro</li><br/>
<li>iPhone 16 Pro Max</li><br/>
<li>Apple Watch Series 10</li><br/>
<li>Apple Watch Ultra 2 (Black)</li><br/>
<li>AirPods 4</li><br/>
<li>AirPods 4 with Active Noise Cancellation</li><br/>
<li>AirPods Max (USB-C)</li><br/>
<li>Various accessories, including a 25W MagSafe Charger</li></ul><br/>
<br/>
Will Apple's earnings results be a trick or a treat? On its last earnings call in August, Apple said it expected its fourth quarter revenue to grow at a rate similar to its third quarter, which would mean around 5% growth on a year-over-year basis. Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/02/apple-4q-2023-results/">reported &#36;89.5 billion revenue</a> in the year-ago quarter, so a 5% increase to that would equal around &#36;94 billion, which would be a fourth-quarter record for Apple. Sounds like a treat.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/aapl/">AAPL</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/earnings/">Earnings</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/03/apple-earnings-on-halloween/">Trick or Treat?

		<description><![CDATA[Apple is planning to refresh the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/">iPad Air</a> in early 2025, about a year after the 2024 refresh. We don't have a full picture of what to expect just yet, but rumors point toward an updated chip and new accessories.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/m2-iPad-Air-Horizontal-Feature-Orange.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-950736" /><br/>
<h2 id="design">Design</h2><br/>
Apple refreshed the design of the &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; in 2024, introducing two size options to match the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a> models. In 2025, we are again expecting 11-inch and 13-inch sizes, but so far, we haven't heard word of any design changes.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2019/03/ipad-air-rear-camera.jpg" alt="" width="1550" height="872" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-951217" /><br/>
The 2025 &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; models are expected to continue to feature the same design as the 2024 &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; models, with an aluminum chassis that has flat sides and rounded edges that wrap around the LCD display. Apple is expected to continue to include a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/touch-id/">Touch ID</a> power button for biometric authentication, and a USB-C port.<br/>
<br/>
There could be additional color options even if we don't get design changes. The current &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; comes in Space Gray, Purple, Blue, and Starlight, a soft gold shade.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="m-series_chip">M-Series Chip</h2><br/>
Even though Apple added the M4 to the &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; and will bring the chip to the newest Mac models this year, the &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; is expected to get the M3, an upgrade to the current <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m2/">M2</a> chip.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/M3-Chip-Apple-Event-Slide.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="898" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-920110" /><br/>
The M3 chip is built on Apple's newer 3-nanometer process, and while it's not as fast as the M4, it's a notable upgrade over the &zwnj;M2&zwnj;. The M3's CPU performance is up to 30 percent faster than the &zwnj;M2&zwnj; CPU performance, and GPU performance is 15 percent faster. The M3 is more efficient than the &zwnj;M2&zwnj; for better battery life, and there is an all-new GPU architecture that uses Dynamic Caching to boost graphics performance for GPU intensive apps and games. There is support for hardware-based ray tracing for an improvement in gaming on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Rumors suggest the &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; will get the M3 instead of the newer M4 that's in the &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; models to differentiate between the two tablets. Apple plans to keep the &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; a step behind the &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="apple_intelligence">Apple Intelligence</h2><br/>
Current &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; models with an &zwnj;M2&zwnj; chip support Apple Intelligence in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-18/">iPadOS 18</a>, and the M3 chips will also work with Apple Intelligence.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="display">Display</h2><br/>
A major differentiator between the &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; is OLED display technology and support for 120Hz ProMotion refresh rates. We don't expect notable updates to the display in 2025, and so far, it doesn't sound like Apple plans to bring ProMotion to the &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj;.<br/>

<h2 id="other_features">Other Features</h2><br/>
Apple brought Wi-Fi 7 support to its latest <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> models, so we could start to see more products updated to the latest Wi-Fi protocol. Wi-Fi 7 brings faster speeds and lower latency, and if Wi-Fi 7 doesn't come to the new &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj;, it'll continue to use Wi-Fi 6E.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="magic_keyboard">Magic Keyboard</h2><br/>
Apple is working on a new version <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/01/apple-working-on-redesigned-ipad-magic-keyboard/">of the Magic Keyboard</a> for the &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj;, and it's supposed to come out in the same time frame as the next-generation &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj;. It won't have an aluminum top case like the Magic Keyboard for the &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj;, but it could get the same function row of keys.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Two Maryland residents who defrauded Apple out of 6,000 iPhones worth over &#36;2.5 million were <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-dc/pr/multimillion-dollar-scheme-defraud-apple-inc-out-6000-iphones-nets-prison-terms-two">sentenced to prison today</a>, according to the United States Department of Justice. The duo devised a repair scheme where they sent in counterfeit iPhones in order to get genuine iPhones in exchange.<br/>
<br/>

Chinese nationals Haotian Sun and Pengfei Xue will each spend more than four years in prison. Sun was sentenced to 57 months in prison, while Xue was given 54 months. Both will serve three years of supervised release after their prison terms, and will need to pay restitution to Apple. Sun has been ordered to pay &#36;1,072,000, while Xue has been ordered to pay &#36;397,800.<br/>
<br/>
Between May 2017 and September 2019, Sun and Xue received shipments of inauthentic iPhones from Hong Kong, and used spoofed serial numbers and/or IMEI numbers to return them to Apple retail stores and Apple Authorized Service Providers. Over 6,000 iPhones were submitted to Apple during that two-year period, according to trial evidence. The intended loss was approximately &#36;3.8 million, and actual loss exceeded &#36;2.5 million.<br/>
<br/>
Back in February, Sun and Xue <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/20/apple-store-repair-scheme-fraud/">were found guilty</a> of mail fraud and conspiracy to commit mail fraud, charges that carried a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/03/apple-repair-iphone-fraud-prison/">Duo That Cost Apple &#36;2.5 Million in Fraudulent iPhone Repair Scheme Get Prison Sentences</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/duo-that-cost-apple-2-5-million-in-fraudulent-iphone-repair-scheme-get-prison-sentences.2439076/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today released iPadOS 18.0.1 for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>, and it brings <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-18/">iPadOS 18</a> to the for M4 <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a> models for the first time since the &zwnj;iPadOS 18&zwnj; update was pulled for those devices. After &zwnj;iPadOS 18&zwnj; was released, it was found that a small number of M4 iPads were bricked when the software was installed. If you haven't been able to install &zwnj;iPadOS 18&zwnj; on your &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj;, it is now available.<br/>
<br/>

The iPadOS 18.0.1 update can be downloaded over-the-air by going to Settings > General > Software Update. iPadOS 18.0.1 is available for all &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; models able to run &zwnj;iPadOS 18&zwnj;. <br/>
<br/>
Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/16/apple-releases-ios-18/">first released iPadOS 18</a> on Monday, September 16, but the update was <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/17/apple-pulls-ipados-18-m4-ipad-pro/">removed the next day</a>. Some M4 &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; owners found that &zwnj;iPadOS 18&zwnj; rendered their devices unusable.<br/>
<br/>
Apple in a statement said that it temporarily removed the update to fix a problem that was affecting only a small number of users.<br/>
<blockquote>"We have temporarily removed the ‌iPadOS 18‌ update for M4 ‌iPad Pro‌ models as we work to resolve an issue that is impacting a small number of devices."</blockquote><br/>
The updated version of &zwnj;iPadOS 18&zwnj; addresses the problem and it should now be safe to install on an M4 &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj;. The update also includes bug fixes available on all iPads: <blockquote>- Messages may unexpectedly quit when replying to a message with a shared Apple Watch face<br/>
- Performance may be impacted due to an issue with memory allocation on some iPad models.</blockquote>iPadOS 18 introduces new customization options for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/home-screen/">Home Screen</a>, a revamped Control Center, and new features for almost every app including <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/photos/">Photos</a>, Messages, Safari, Calculator, and Notes.<br/>
