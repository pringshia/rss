		<description><![CDATA[Apple is working on a foldable iPhone that could be released as early as 2026, according to an exclusive report published today <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/apple-moves-forward-with-foldable-iphone?rc=583sff">by <em>The Information</em></a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/Galaxy-Z-Flip-Samsung.jpeg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-959605" /><br/>
The report claims the device would feature a "clamshell" design, similar to Samsung's line of Galaxy Z Flip smartphones. Apple is said to have contacted suppliers in Asia in recent months about making components for the device.<br/>
<br/>
Rumors about a foldable iPhone have circulated for many years, but the report claims that Apple is finally moving forward with the project. The device has allegedly been given a codename of "V68" inside Apple, suggesting that work is ramping up.<br/>
<br/>
Apple is said to have struggled to achieve its goal of eliminating a visible crease in the area where the iPhone's screen would fold, but this obstacle could eventually be overcome. However, there is of course a possibility that Apple decides not to release a foldable iPhone, should the device fail to meet the company's high quality standards.<br/>
<br/>
In any case, it appears that a foldable iPhone is still at least a few years away.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/theinformation-com/">The Information</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/foldable-iphone/">Foldable iPhone</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/23/foldable-iphone-2026-report/">Apple Reportedly Working on Foldable iPhone With Similar Design as Samsung&#039;s Galaxy Z Flip</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-reportedly-working-on-foldable-iphone-with-similar-design-as-samsungs-galaxy-z-flip.2432036/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Last year, ESR was one of the first companies to launch a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/14/esr-halolock-geo-wallet-stand/">MagSafe wallet accessory</a> with full support for Apple's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/find-my-network-accessory-program/">Find My</a> network, using an on-board rechargeable module to tap into the network of hundreds of millions of Apple devices to help you keep tabs on your wallet. ESR has returned today with a <a href="https://waymeet-limited.kckb.me/774f288a">new crowdfunding campaign</a> for what it says is the first full-fledged wallet with integrated &zwnj;Find My&zwnj; support.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8vfFjqmI_w8?si=_fzJmPwc5UD1ATa6" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><br/>
Available in seven color options, ESR's Geo Wallet is a traditional bifold wallet with a thin &zwnj;Find My&zwnj; module that allows you to keep track of your wallet's real-time location via the Items tab in Apple's &zwnj;Find My&zwnj; app. While some wallet makers have introduced wallets that allow you to attach an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airtags/">AirTag</a> and other accessory companies have launched thin card-style &zwnj;Find My&zwnj; trackers, ESR appears to be the first to put the tracker right into the wallet itself, helping to reduce weight and bulk.<br/>
<br/>
ESR says the battery for the &zwnj;Find My&zwnj; module in the Geo Wallet lasts up to five months, and with a magnetic charging cable the battery can be recharged in just two hours.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/esr-geo-wallet-specs-colors.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="705" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-959583" /><br/>
With windowed slots for two ID cards, four additional slots for bank or membership cards, and a divided compartment for organizing your cash, the Geo Wallet also offer RFID-blocking technology to help keep your cards safe.<br/>
<br/>
The Geo Wallet is available in seven colors: carbon fiber, opal gray, elephant gray, twilight black, cocoa, aged leather, and tangerine. <br/>
<br/>
As with most crowdfunding campaigns, there are <a href="https://waymeet-limited.kckb.me/774f288a">multiple reward tiers available</a> with varying pricing. The &#36;38 Super Early Bird tier has already sold out, but there are still some slots left in the &#36;41 Early Bird tier, and if you miss out on those it jumps to &#36;44 at the Kickstarter Special tier. Multipacks are also available.<br/>
<br/>
As a Kickstarter campaign, the Geo Wallet is not available for immediate delivery, but ESR is aiming to start production in August and begin shipping in January, and the company has a track record of delivering on its campaigns.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[The Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority (SEPTA) this week <a href="https://wwww.septa.org/bulletins/express-mode-iphone-and-apple-watch/">announced</a> that it has started upgrading its payment readers with support for Apple Pay with Express Mode. This feature allows transit users to pay for their fare by tapping their iPhone or Apple Watch near the reader, without needing to unlock or wake the device.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/SEPTA-Apple-Pay-Express-Mode.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="675" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-959551" /><br/>
The upgrades began rolling out on Monday across select SEPTA Metro stations and buses in the Greater Philadelphia area, according to the announcement.<br/>
<br/>
Express Mode for SEPTA is limited to credit and debit cards added to the Wallet app. It is still not possible to add the SEPTA Key fare card to the Wallet app, and Express Mode does not support SEPTA's discounted weekly or monthly passes.<br/>
<br/>
More details can be found <a href="https://wwww.septa.org/bulletins/express-mode-iphone-and-apple-watch/">on the SEPTA website</a>.<br/>

EyeSight is designed to reduce social isolation in VR by making the user's eyes visible to others on an external display. Meta's patent, titled "Embedded Sensors in Immersive Reality Headset to Enable Social Presence," suggests that the company is considering this kind of functionality for its own devices.<br/>
<br/>
EyeSight uses a scan of the user's face to create a virtual image of their eyes on an external display, thereby maintaining a semblance of eye contact and interaction with others in the real world. Apple says that EyeSight "reveals your eyes on the front of your &zwnj;Apple Vision Pro&zwnj;, and lets those nearby know when you're using apps or are fully immersed in an experience." <br/>
<br/>
Meta's approach involves a method for updating a user's avatar in real-time using facial expressions detected by sensors embedded in the headset. These sensors capture signals indicative of facial muscle movements, which are then interpreted using a machine learning algorithm to determine the user's facial expression. The system adjusts the user's avatar accordingly and integrates it into an immersive reality application.<br/>
<br/>
The headset in this embodiment includes various sensors, such as ECG (electrocardiogram), EEG (electroencephalogram), and PPG (photoplethysmogram), which not only track facial movements but also monitor the user's cardiovascular health. The integration of health-related functionalities distinguishes Meta's approach from Apple's EyeSight, which primarily focuses on displaying a virtual image of the user's eyes to maintain a connection with the real world.<br/>
<br/>
Meta's decision to file the patent seemingly indicates its recognition of the value in Apple's EyeSight feature, despite the mixed reviews it has received. While some critics have found the feature unnecessary and predict it could be dropped in future models, its introduction highlights a broader industry trend towards enhancing social presence when using headset devices.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/patent/">Patent</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/patentlyapple-com/">Patently Apple</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/meta/">Meta</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AppleVisionPro">Vision Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-vision-pro.209">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/23/new-meta-patent-blatantly-mimics-eyesight/">New Meta Patent Blatantly Mimics Apple&#039;s EyeSight Feature</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/new-meta-patent-blatantly-mimics-apples-eyesight-feature.2432015/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Electric automaker Rivian has no plans to introduce support for Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/carplay/">CarPlay</a> in its vehicles, founder and CEO RJ Scaringe says.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/Next-Generation-CarPlay-Design-WWDC-2024-7.jpeg" alt="" width="3840" height="2160" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-954806" /><br/>
The company's stance was explained in a recent interview with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/22/24203609/rivian-apple-carplay-support-rj-scaringe-decoder"><em>The Verge</em></a>'s Nilay Patel on the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24201749/rivian-ceo-rj-scaringe-ev-electric-truck-r1-tesla-model-y-competition-decoder-interview">"Decoder" podcast</a>. Scaringe emphasized that Rivian's desire to create a seamless and well-integrated digital experience is the primary reason for not adopting &zwnj;CarPlay&zwnj;. He likened the decision to Apple choosing to develop iOS and macOS instead of using Microsoft's Windows operating system, stating, "There is a reason that ironically is very consistent with Apple ethos for us to want to control the ecosystem."<br/>
<br/>
Apple &zwnj;CarPlay&zwnj; was introduced in 2014 and allows <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> users to mirror some of their phone's features on a car's infotainment system, providing access to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a>, navigation, and some apps in a familiar interface. It has become a popular feature in many vehicles, with a significant number of consumers considering it a critical factor in purchasing decisions. <br/>
<br/>
Rivian's rejection of &zwnj;CarPlay&zwnj; stems from a desire to maintain control over the entire user experience within its vehicles. Scaringe highlighted that &zwnj;CarPlay&zwnj;'s inability to "leverage other parts of the vehicle experience" would necessitate users to exit the app for certain functions, such as opening the front trunk. He explained, "We have taken the view of the digital experience in the vehicle wants to feel consistent and holistically harmonious across every touchpoint." <br/>
<br/>
The decision to exclude &zwnj;CarPlay&zwnj; is seen as part of Rivian's broader strategy to control the "digital real estate" within its vehicles. Scaringe stated, "We just believe that it is such an important piece of real estate, the digital ecosystem, that it was something we want to retain."<br/>
<br/>
He also acknowledged customer feedback regarding the current shortcomings in Rivian's mapping and navigation systems, an area where &zwnj;CarPlay&zwnj; excels. He noted that Rivian is actively working on improvements, facilitated by the company's acquisition of route planning app maker Iternio. <br/>
<br/>
Despite not supporting &zwnj;CarPlay&zwnj;, Rivian plans to incorporate many of its desirable features on an "à la carte basis." The company has already integrated <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/">Apple Music</a> with Spatial Audio support. Scaringe expressed his admiration for Apple's products and reiterated the strong relationship between the two companies. However, he emphasized the importance of consistency and control in delivering a "pure product experience" for Rivian customers.<br/>
<br/>
The absence of &zwnj;CarPlay&zwnj; in Rivian's vehicles is not unique in the automotive industry. Tesla has never adopted the feature, and General Motors recently <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/31/general-motors-to-phase-out-apple-carplay/">decided to drop support for CarPlay</a> and Android Auto in its future electric vehicle models. In contrast, luxury brands like Porsche and Aston Martin are set to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/20/first-next-generation-carplay-vehicles-announced/">adopt the next-generation CarPlay experience</a>.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/carplay/">CarPlay</a></div><div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/theverge-com/">The Verge</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/rivian/">Rivian</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/homepod-homekit-carplay-home-auto-technology.193">HomePod, HomeKit, CarPlay, Home & Auto Technology</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/23/rivian-explains-why-no-apple-carplay/">Rivian CEO Explains Why Apple CarPlay Won&#039;t Come to Its Vehicles</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/rivian-ceo-explains-why-apple-carplay-wont-come-to-its-vehicles.2432014/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">upcoming iPhone 16 models</a> that we're expecting to see in September are going to be quite similar to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a> models, but rumors suggest that Apple is making big changes in 2025. We've been hearing hints of an all-new device in the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> lineup, and it may be the most expensive &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; Apple has offered to date.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/iPhone-17-Plus-Feature-Purple.jpg" alt="" width="2250" height="1265" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-959520" /><br/>
<h2>New 'Slim' Design</h2><br/>
Rumors have taken to referring to the new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17/">iPhone 17</a> that Apple has planned as the "&zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj; Slim," but Apple almost certainly won't use that naming. The "slim" descriptor references the sleeker, thinner design of the device.<br/>
<br/>
With the 12.9-inch M4 <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a> model, Apple shaved over a millimeter off of the thickness, resulting in the thinnest device Apple has made to date. That same focus on a svelte design is expected in 2025, and the upcoming &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; is said to be "significantly thinner" than current iPhones.<br/>
<br/>
We don't know specifics on just how thin Apple is going to make this &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;, but the &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; is just 5.1mm thick and could serve as a blueprint on what to expect.<br/>
<br/>
As for size, the &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj; Slim is expected to fall somewhere between the 6.1-inch <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a> and the 6.7-inch &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj;. Separate rumors have targeted <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/06/iphone-17-slim-to-feature-6-55-inch-display/">6.55 inches</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/06/iphone-17-slim-rumor/">6.6 inches</a>, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/22/iphone-17-lineup-specs-detail-upgrades/">6.65 inches</a> as the display size that Apple has settled on, which would make it smaller than the &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; Max (and the rumored <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/">iPhone 16 Pro</a> Max).<br/>
<br/>
Though Apple has used titanium for the higher-end &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; models since last year, the &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj; Slim is rumored to have an aluminum chassis. The first rumors that surfaced about the device actually indicated that it would replace the "Plus" &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; in Apple's lineup, but later information points toward a new high-end &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; that's even more expensive than the Pro Max.<br/>
<br/>
Based on the rumors we've heard so far, it sounds like the &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj; Slim will be akin to the 2017 &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; X. The &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; X marked a major jump forward in technology, and it was sold alongside the standard &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 8 models.<br/>
<br/>
It's sounding like we're going to get an &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj;, an &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj; Pro, an &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj; Pro Max, and this new high-end &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj; Slim, with Apple eliminating the Plus model entirely. The &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj; Slim could be more expensive than the &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; Max, which Apple currently starts at &#36;1,199.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Relocated Cameras</h2><br/>
Along with a thinner and lighter design, the high-end &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj; could feature the first major rear camera overhaul. Rumors suggest that the cameras could be relocated from the top-left corner of the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; to the top center, which could result in a design similar to the Google Pixel.<br/>
<br/>
The Pixel 8 Pro has a raised band across the back of the device that houses a trio of cameras, a laser detect auto focus sensor, and a flash.<br/>
<br/>
Apple is still testing designs for the &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj;, but the relocated camera bump is a possibility.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Display Improvements</h2><br/>
ProMotion display technology that allows for variable refresh rates from 1Hz to 120Hz is expected for all &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; models in 2025, including the high-end model, but the bigger news is that Apple is rumored to be using a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/19/iphone-17-anti-reflective-display/">new display coating</a>.<br/>
<br/>
The new coating is said to have improved anti-reflective properties and better scratch resistance than the current Ceramic Shield coating. It's been described as a "super-hard anti-reflective layer" in leaks.<br/>
<br/>
Apple has used Ceramic Shield since 2020. It's a ceramic-glass hybrid material developed in partnership with Corning. Corning has since made improvements in its protective glass products, and the company's <a href="https://www.corning.com/gorillaglass/worldwide/en/corning-gorilla-armor.html">Gorilla Armor material</a> reduces reflectance by up to 75 percent while also boosting drop protection and scratch resistance. Corning has had a longtime relationship with Apple, and while Gorilla Armor was developed for Samsung, Corning could make a similar product for Apple.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Better Selfie Cam and Dynamic Island Changes</h2><br/>
A slimmed down <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/dynamic-island/">Dynamic Island</a> that takes up less screen space is expected for the new &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj;. There have been rumors for years about under-display <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mask-face-id/">Face ID</a> technology, and we could see the first hints of it in 2025.<br/>
<br/>
There will be a smaller hole and pill-shaped cutout for the front-facing camera, but it doesn't sound like Apple is going to reach its all-display design goals just yet.<br/>
<br/>
As part of the &zwnj;Dynamic Island&zwnj; redesign, Apple is rumored to be adopting a 24-megapixel front-facing camera, which would be an upgrade over the current 12-megapixel selfie camera. It will feature a six-element lens for improved image quality, and the boost in resolution will capture more detail and allow for more cropping in without sacrificing quality.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Faster Chips</h2><br/>
It sounds like &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj; series won't get TSMC's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/16/iphone-17-unlikely-to-get-2nm-chip/">next-generation 2-nanometer chips</a>, but we are expecting A19 chip technology that's likely built on an upgraded 3-nanometer process. Apple typically upgrades iPhones with faster and more efficient chip technology each year, and we're expecting the best chip available in 2025 to be included in the &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj; Slim.<br/>
<br/>
TSMC is working on 2nm chips, but mass production isn't expected until the end of 2025, which would be too late for the &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj; models. If work speeds up, that could change. Compared to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/3nm/">3nm</a> chip technology, 2nm fabrication process could bring a 10 to 15 percent speed improvement at the same power or a 25 to 30 percent power reduction at the same speed.<br/>
<br/>
Chips built on an upgraded 3-nanometer process won't have the same gains as chips built on the 2-nanometer process, but we can still count on modest boosts to CPU and GPU speeds. With Apple's heavy focus on AI, the dedicated Neural Engine for machine learning tasks is also likely to see improvement.<br/>
<br/>
TSMC is working on its N3P process, with mass production set to begin in late 2024. <a href="https://www.anandtech.com/show/21394/tsmc-performanceoptimized-3nm-process-technology-on-track-for-mass-production-this-year">Compared to earlier versions</a> of &zwnj;3nm&zwnj; chips, the N3P chips offer increased performance efficiency and increased transistor density.<br/>
<br/>
Up to 12GB RAM has been rumored for the high-end &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj; models, and that jump would make sense in the more expensive &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj; Slim. Currently, RAM maxes out at 8GB.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Google no longer plans to deprecate third-party cookies in the Chrome browser, marking a notable change to a prior decision to phase out third-party cookies by 2025. Google announced its cookie updates <a href="https://privacysandbox.com/intl/en_us/news/privacy-sandbox-update/">in a blog post</a> shared today, where the company said that it instead plans to focus on user choice.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/06/Chrome-Feature-22.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-851161" /><br/>
Rather than eliminating third-party cookies entirely, Google will introduce "a new experience in Chrome" that is designed to allow people to "make an informed choice" applicable across their web browsing.<br/>
<br/>
Back in 2020, Google claimed that it would phase out support for third-party cookies in Chrome by 2022, a timeline that was pushed back multiple times due to complaints from advertisers and regulatory issues. Google has been working on a Privacy Sandbox to find ways to improve privacy while still delivering info to advertisers, but third-party cookies will now be sticking around so as not to impact publishers and advertisers.<br/>
<br/>
The UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) had opposed Google's plan to stop relying on third-party cookies because a shift to Privacy Sandbox could limit competition in digital advertising, and now the CMA says that it is <a href="https://x.com/CMAgovUK/status/1815465046689882274">reviewing Google's new plan</a> for a user-choice prompt.<br/>
<br/>
Google does not plan to stop working on its Privacy Sandbox APIs, and the company says they will improve over time so that developers will have a privacy preserving alternative to cookies. Additional privacy controls, such as IP Protection, will be added to Chrome's Incognito mode.<br/>
<br/>
As of now, the new customer choices that Google is planning for are being discussed with regulators, with more information to come at a later date.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/chrome/">Chrome</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/22/google-keeping-third-party-cookies-chrome/">Google No Longer Plans to Eliminate Third-Party Cookies in Chrome</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/google-no-longer-plans-to-eliminate-third-party-cookies-in-chrome.2431972/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Last Friday, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/19/global-it-outage-limited-to-windows-pcs/">a major CrowdStrike outage</a> impacted PCs running Microsoft Windows, causing worldwide issues affecting airlines, retailers, banks, hospitals, rail networks, and more. Computers were stuck in continuous recovery loops, rendering them unusable.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-959336" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/bsod.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" /><br/>
The failure was caused by an update to the CrowdStrike Falcon antivirus software that auto-installed on Windows 10 PCs, but Mac and Linux machines were not affected even though they received the same software. A report from <em><a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/cybersecurity/microsoft-tech-outage-role-crowdstrike-50917b90">The Wall Street Journal</a></em> delves into what happened and includes some critical information from Microsoft on why Macs did not get taken out by the update.<br/>
<br/>
On Windows machines, CrowdStrike's Falcon security software is a kernel module, which gives the software full access to a PC. The kernel manages memory, processes, files, and devices, and it's basically the heart of the operating system. Much of the software on a PC is typically limited to user mode, where bad code can't cause harm, but software with kernel mode access can cause catastrophic total machine failures, like what was encountered last week.<br/>
<br/>
The Falcon software was not able to wreak similar havoc on Macs because Apple does not give software makers kernel access. In macOS Catalina, which came out in 2019, Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/18/apple-updates-platform-security-guide/">deprecated kernel extensions</a> and transitioned to system extensions that run in a user space instead of at a kernel level. The change made Macs more stable and more secure, adding protection against unstable software updates like the one CrowdStrike pushed out. It is not possible for Macs to have a similar failure because of the change that Apple made.<br/>
<br/>
In a statement to <em>The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/wsj-com/">Wall Street Journal</a></em>, Microsoft blamed the European Commission for an inability to offer the same protections that Macs have. Microsoft said that it is unable to wall off its operating system because of an "understanding" with the European Commission. <a href="https://news.microsoft.com/2009/12/16/microsoft-statement-on-european-commission-decision/">Back in 2009</a>, Microsoft agreed to interoperability rules that provide third-party security apps with the same level of access to Windows that Microsoft gets. Microsoft agreed to provide kernel access in order to resolve multiple longstanding competition law issues in Europe.<br/>
<br/>
Apple has not been forced to make changes to how Macs work, but the European Commission has been targeting the closed nature of iOS, and Apple has warned that the updates <a href="https://developer.apple.com/support/dma-and-apps-in-the-eu/">that have already been implemented</a> could lead to security risks in the future. The European Union's Digital Markets Act has pushed Apple to allow developers to offer apps through third-party marketplaces and websites. Apple says explicitly that the DMA compromises its ability to "detect, prevent, and take action against malicious apps."<br/>
<br/>
The major CrowdStrike failure that affected Windows PCs highlights some of the unintended consequences and the tradeoffs inherent in legislation that weakens security in the name of open access. CrowdStrike's simple software update impacted global infrastructure, bringing travel, commerce, and healthcare to a standstill.<br/>
<br/>
Microsoft does not seem to have a way to stop a recurrence because it can't cut off kernel access. The company says that significant incidents "are infrequent" and that less than one percent of all Windows machines were impacted. CrowdStrike says that it is "deeply sorry for the inconvenience and disruption," and that in the future, it will share the steps that it is taking to prevent a similar situation.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/microsoft/">Microsoft</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/22/microsoft-blames-european-commission-for-outage/">Microsoft Blames European Commission for Major Worldwide Outage</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/microsoft-blames-european-commission-for-major-worldwide-outage.2431960/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today added a Classical Top 100 chart to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/">Apple Music</a> Classical, the classical music streaming service that it <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/28/apple-music-classical-now-available/">introduced in early 2023</a>.<br/>

The list features the most popular classical music albums that are streamed globally, combining five data sources from more than 165 countries. Top 100 comes from &zwnj;Apple Music&zwnj; Classical streams, &zwnj;Apple Music&zwnj; streams, iTunes downloads, iTunes song sales, and Shazam tags.<br/>
<br/>
According to Apple, the Classical Top 100 list is the most comprehensive classical music chart available. The first number one album is Bach: Keyboard Concertos with Chinese pianist Tianqi Du and the Academy of St Martins in the Fields conducted by Jonathan Bloxham. The top five albums feature artists from Canada, China, Brazil, Latvia, Norway, and the UK, and encompass everything from full orchestral symphonies to solo guitar.<br/>
<br/>
Apple plans to update the Apple Classical Top 100 list each Monday, and it can be found on the &zwnj;Apple Music&zwnj; Classical Home tab. Each chart includes activity from the prior week.<br/>
<br/>
&zwnj;Apple Music&zwnj; Classical is a standalone music app designed for classical music lovers and musicians. It has the world's largest classical music catalogue, and it can be downloaded from the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a> for free.

		<description><![CDATA[Samsung is hosting a new <a href="https://howl.me/cmH18MxkNu2">"Black Friday in July" sale</a>, which includes big discounts on multiple product lines sitewide. The popular ViewFinity S9 5K Smart Monitor and new Smart Monitor M80D are both discounted during this sale, but you'll also find sales on storage, audio, TVs, smartphones, and home appliances.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
The Smart Monitor M80D was announced at CES in January and launched in early June. The display retains key features of the previous model, like USB-C charging connectivity, AirPlay 2 support, an integrated webcam, and several smart TV features that enable it to be used when not connected to a PC. It's on sale today for <a href="https://howl.me/cmEbIKKFC8A"><strong>&#36;499.99</strong></a>, which is a new all-time low price and beats the previous deal from earlier in the month by about &#36;50.<br/>

<br/>
In terms of new features, the M80D includes a Multi Control feature that allows images and text to be moved between the display and a Galaxy Book, Tablet, or Phone. You can also pair Galaxy Buds to the monitor for a spatial audio experience with head tracking, as well as guided workouts when paired with a Galaxy Watch.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[The fourth-generation <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-se/">iPhone SE</a> will offer a series of major upgrades over the current model, the leaker known as "Ice Universe" claims.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/iPhone-SE-4-Thumb-1.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-951978" /><br/>
The information was listed in a <a href="https://weibo.com/5673255066/OoxQuAnxl?pagetype=profilefeed">post on Weibo</a>, which also detailed the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/22/iphone-17-lineup-specs-detail-upgrades/">specifications of the iPhone 17 lineup</a>. As previously rumored, the fourth-generation &zwnj;iPhone SE&zwnj; is expected to feature <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mask-face-id/">Face ID</a> and USB-C, marking a major upgrade from current and previous models that have all featured a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/touch-id/">Touch ID</a> Home button and a Lightning port.<br/>
<br/>
The device's display will apparently grow in size from 4.7 inches to 6.06 inches and feature an OLED panel for the first time. The new &zwnj;iPhone SE&zwnj; is also expected to tout an A18 chip like the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a> lineup, 6GB to 8GB of LPDDR5 memory, an aluminum chassis, and a single rear 48-megapixel camera. The fourth-generation &zwnj;iPhone SE&zwnj; will apparently launch between March and May of 2025 with a price point of &#36;499 to &#36;549. The current model launched in March 2022 for &#36;429.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-se/">iPhone SE</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ice-universe/">Ice Universe</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone_SE">iPhone SE (Don't Buy)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99">iPhone</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/22/iphone-se-4-rumored-to-launch-early-next-year/">iPhone SE 4 Rumored to Launch Early Next Year With OLED Display, 48MP Camera, and More</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-se-4-rumored-to-launch-early-next-year-with-oled-display-48mp-camera-and-more.2431934/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple is scaling back its Hollywood spending after investing over &#36;20 billion in original programming with limited success, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-07-21/apple-tries-to-rein-in-hollywood-spending-after-years-of-losses"><em>Bloomberg</em></a> reports.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/Apple-TV-Plus-Feature-2-Magenta-and-Blue.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-959290" /><br/>
This shift comes after the streaming service, which launched in 2019, struggled to capture a significant share of the market, accounting for only 0.2% of TV viewership in the U.S., compared to Netflix's 8%. Despite heavy investment, critical acclaim, and numerous award nominations, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-tv-plus/">Apple TV+</a> purportedly generates less viewing in one month than Netflix does in a single day.<br/>
<br/>
Over the last five years, the &zwnj;Apple TV+&zwnj; has had only four series make Nielsen's weekly list of the ten most popular original streaming shows. While <em>Ted Lasso</em> was the most-watched streaming show of 2023, &zwnj;Apple TV+&zwnj; still accounts for a smaller share of top ten hits than any streaming service except Paramount+.<br/>
<br/>
Apple's initial foray into streaming was marked by lavish spending on high-profile projects and talent, including deals with big names like Oprah Winfrey, Steven Spielberg, and Jennifer Aniston. The company's Hollywood operation, led by studio chiefs Zack Van Amburg and Jamie Erlicht, positioned itself as a talent-friendly destination, reminiscent of HBO, offering creators seemingly unlimited financial resources.<br/>
<br/>
Apple spent more than &#36;500 million combined on movies from directors Martin Scorsese, Ridley Scott, and Matthew Vaughn, and upwards of &#36;250 million on the World War II miniseries <em>Masters of the Air</em>. Despite the strong reviews and awards nominations, these projects have not yielded the viewership that Apple apparently hoped for.<br/>
<br/>
The company's new strategy is said to involve tighter budget controls and a more cautious approach to spending. This includes paying less upfront for shows, being quicker to cancel underperforming series, and delaying productions to manage costs better. For instance, the production of the sci-fi series <em>Foundation</em> was postponed to prevent budget overruns caused by delays related to the 2023 actors and writers strikes.<br/>
<br/>
The cost of the second season of <em>Severance</em> surged to over &#36;20 million per episode due to pandemic-related delays, internal conflicts, and additional expenses such as hiring <em>House of Cards</em> creator Beau Willimon for script contributions. Management has asked the producers of <em>Severance</em> to reduce the budget for future seasons, emphasizing the need for financial sustainability.<br/>
<br/>
Apple has also become more selective in acquiring new projects, declining to buy some shows that sellers believe the company would have accepted just a few years ago. The company allegedly wants to shed the image of being Hollywood's biggest spender and bring more discipline and strategy to its content investments.<br/>
<br/>
While still willing to invest heavily in certain high-profile projects, such as <em>The Morning Show</em>, where cast salaries alone exceed &#36;50 million for the upcoming season, &zwnj;Apple TV+&zwnj; is becoming more fiscally conservative. <em>The Morning Show</em> stars Jennifer Aniston and Reese Witherspoon will each earn more than &#36;2 million per episode. This recalibration comes at a time when other major studios like Disney, Warner Bros., and Paramount are similarly cutting back on streaming budgets due to mounting losses. <div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/bloomberg-com/">Bloomberg</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-tv-plus/">Apple TV Plus</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/22/apple-tv-plus-curbs-costs/">Apple TV+ Curbs Costs After Expensive Projects Fail to Capture Viewers</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-tv-curbs-costs-after-expensive-projects-fail-to-capture-viewers.2431925/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Key details about the overall specifications of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17/">iPhone 17</a> lineup have been shared by the leaker known as "Ice Universe," clarifying several important aspects of next year's devices.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/iPhone-17-Plus-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-952009" /><br/>
Reports in recent months have converged in agreement that Apple will discontinue the "Plus" <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> model in 2025 while introducing an all-new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/17/iphone-17-slim-everything-we-know/">iPhone 17 "Slim" model</a> as an even more high-end option sitting above the &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj; Pro Max in the lineup. The latest information from Ice Universe, shared yesterday <a href="https://weibo.com/5673255066/OoxQuAnxl?pagetype=profilefeed">on Weibo</a>, corroborates this and claims that the alleged display sizes and price points will be as follows:<br/>
<br/>
<ul><br/>
  <li><strong>iPhone 17</strong>: 6.27-inch LTPO display (&#36;799)</li><br/>
  <li><strong>iPhone 17 Pro</strong>: 6.27-inch LTPO display (&#36;1,099)</li><br/>
  <li><strong>iPhone 17 Pro Max</strong>: 6.86-inch LTPO display (&#36;1,199)</li><br/>
  <li><strong>iPhone 17 "Slim"</strong>: 6.65-inch LTPO display (&#36;1,299)</li><br/>
</ul><br/>
<br/>
Notably, all four &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj; models will apparently feature LTPO displays for the first time, enabling ProMotion for a variable refresh rate up to 120Hz. To date, ProMotion displays have been exclusive to Apple's "Pro" devices, so the &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj; may be the first time that the technology expands to a lower-cost device.<br/>
<br/>
The &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj; "Slim" is said to become the new &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; flagship with a price tag of approximately &#36;1,299, making it the most expensive &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; model to date. It will allegedly feature a 6.65-inch display, placing it between the &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj; Pro and &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj; Pro Max in size.<br/>
<br/>
The &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj; Pro models will purportedly feature 12GB of memory, a triple 48-megapixel rear camera system, and an A19 Pro chip fabricated with TSMC's N3P process, whereas the standard model will feature a separate A19 chip. This contrasts with the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a> lineup, which is expected to feature the same A18 chip across the board.<br/>
<br/>
The post also suggests that the &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj; "Slim" will feature an A19 chip, a dual dear camera system, an aluminum chassis, and 8GB of memory, but it is not clear if this is accurate. It is possible that this information has simply been assumed based on its replacement of the "Plus" model and it seems potentially strange for the new high-end model to have inferior specifications to the Pro models. The &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj; lineup is expected to be introduced in September 2025.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17/">iPhone 17</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ice-universe/">Ice Universe</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/22/iphone-17-lineup-specs-detail-upgrades/">iPhone 17 Lineup Specs Detail Display Upgrade and New High-End Model</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-17-lineup-specs-detail-display-upgrade-and-new-high-end-model.2431922/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The public betas of iOS 18 and other upcoming major operating system updates are finally here! Apple has spent the past month refining the betas through developer testing, and it's now time to open them up for broader access ahead of a full public launch several months from now.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/top-stories-20jul2024.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-959414" /><br/>
We also got a surprise hardware update this week, but it was one of the most minor updates imaginable – swapping out the Space Gray color of the HomePod mini for a new version in an extremely similar Midnight color. This week also saw us taking a look ahead at the upcoming iPhone 16 and Apple Watch lineups that should now be less than two months way, while we went hands-on with Samsung's new earbuds that have some striking similarities to Apple's AirPods Pro, so read on below for all the details!<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Apple Releases First iOS 18 and iPadOS 18 Public Betas</h2><br/>
The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/15/apple-releases-ios-18-public-beta-1/">first public beta of iOS 18 is now available for the iPhone</a>, allowing anyone to test the update for free. We recommend installing the beta on a secondary iPhone, rather than the one that you use daily, as there are often bugs and other issues with pre-release software.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/Generic-iOS-18-Public-Beta-Feature-Real-Mock.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-957836" /><br/>
<ul><li><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/install-the-ios-18-public-beta/">How to Install the iOS 18 Public Beta</a></li></ul><br/>
<br/>
iOS 18 features more Home Screen and Control Center customization options, a completely redesigned Photos app, the ability to use any emoji as a Tapback in the Messages app, an option to lock apps behind Face ID or Touch ID, and much more. The tentpole feature of iOS 18 is Apple Intelligence, which is Apple's new suite of generative AI features coming to iPhone 15 Pro models and newer later this year.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Apple Releases HomePod Mini in New Midnight Color</h2><br/>
Apple this week announced that the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/15/homepod-mini-midnight-color/">HomePod mini is now available in a new Midnight color</a>, which replaces the Space Gray color previously offered.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/HomePod-Mini-Midnight-1.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-958753" /><br/>
There does not appear to be any other changes to the HomePod mini, which continues to start at &#36;99 in the United States. In fact, Midnight looks nearly identical to Space Gray, so there is little reason for any existing HomePod mini owners to purchase the new color option.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>iPhone 16 Series Is Just Two Months Away: Everything We Know</h2><br/>
Apple's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/15/iphone-16-series-all-the-latest-rumors/">next-generation iPhone 16 series</a> is just two months away from being unveiled, and there are already many rumors for the devices.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/12/iPhone-16-Pro-Sizes-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-927877" /><br/>
Earlier this week, we <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/15/iphone-16-series-all-the-latest-rumors/">listed everything that we know about the iPhone 16 series</a> based on leaked information, with one key change expected to be larger displays on the iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max. Plenty of other new features are expected, so <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/15/iphone-16-series-all-the-latest-rumors/">check out the full list</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>2024 Apple Watch Lineup: Key Changes We're Expecting</h2><br/>
Alongside the iPhone 16 series later this year, we can expect the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/16/2024-apple-watch-lineup-key-changes/">next-generation Apple Watch lineup</a>, including so-called Apple Watch Series 10, Apple Watch Ultra 3, and Apple Watch SE 3 models.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/Apple-Watch-Series-9.jpg" alt="" width="2880" height="1620" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-910331" /><br/>
Earlier this week, we rounded up <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/16/2024-apple-watch-lineup-key-changes/">key changes to expect from the next Apple Watch lineup</a>, including larger display sizes for some models. As is often the case, new health features like sleep apnea detection have also been rumored.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>iOS 18 Passwords App: All the Features</h2><br/>
iOS 18 features a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ios-18-passwords/">standalone Passwords app</a> from Apple that surfaces some of the iCloud Keychain functionality built into the Settings app on previous versions of iOS for more convenient access.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/Generic-iOS-18-Passwords-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-959050" /><br/>
We recently shared a guide that <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ios-18-passwords/">highlights all of the features built into the Passwords app</a>, which features a simpler layout compared to the previous iCloud Keychain section of the Settings app.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Apple's AirPods Pro 2 vs. Samsung's Galaxy Buds3 Pro</h2><br/>
Samsung last week introduced its latest earbuds, the Galaxy Buds3 Pro, which look quite a bit like Apple's AirPods Pro 2. Given the similarities, we thought we'd <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/13/airpods-pro-2-vs-galaxy-buds3-pro/">compare Samsung's new earbuds to the ‌AirPods Pro‌</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/AirPods-Pro-vs-Galaxy-Buds3-Thumb-1.jpg" alt="" width="2298" height="1292" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-958664" /><br/>
<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/13/airpods-pro-2-vs-galaxy-buds3-pro/">Check out our hands-on video</a> that goes through the design similarities and differences, performance comparisons, and other features to get an idea of how they match head-to-head. Apple users will almost certainly want to stick with AirPods Pro while Android users would want to opt for the Galaxy Buds, but it's always good to see what the competition is up to.<br/>
<br/>
