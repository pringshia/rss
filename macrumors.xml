		<description><![CDATA[With the release of a new operating system, there are multiple features and design elements for developers to adopt. Now that <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a> is out, many major apps are getting interesting updates today, which we've rounded up below. <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/watchos-10/">watchOS 10</a> also has a new design language, so there are a range of Apple Watch updates to check out too.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/flighty-standby.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-912196" /><br/>
<h2><a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/id1358823008">Flighty</a> (Free, Premium Subscription)</h2><br/>
Popular flight tracking app Flighty is expanding to the Apple Watch for the first time, bringing crucial flight details to your wrist. Flighty for Apple Watch works like Flighty on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>, but it provides intelligent updates for each leg of the flight.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/flighty-ios-17-apple-watch.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-912197" /><br/>
When you're getting ready to go to the airport, it will let you know the time your plane is taking off and whether there are any delays, then once you're there, you'll see your gate, departure time, and seat number. After you board, you'll get a readout of your flight's progress. Flighty is using the new &zwnj;watchOS 10&zwnj; visual design and shows up in the Apple Watch Smart Stack accessible by swiping up on the watch face or turning the Digital Crown. Flighty also has a widget designed for StandBy mode in &zwnj;iOS 17&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/carrot-weather-alerts-radar/id961390574">Carrot Weather</a> (Free, Premium Subscription)</h2><br/>
Carrot Weather is using the &zwnj;iOS 17&zwnj; Personal Voice feature to let users have their own voice give weather updates. With Personal Voice, an accessibility feature, you can create a digital version of your voice that can speak aloud for you. It's designed for individuals who may lose their ability to speak, but anyone can use it.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/ios-17-carrot-weather.jpg" alt="" width="3840" height="2160" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-912195" /><br/>
There are new weather widgets that can be used with StandBy mode on the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;, and the Apple Watch app has been redesigned with Apple's new aesthetic that is designed to make information more easily accessible.<br/>
<br/>
<h2><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/slopes/id643351983">Slopes</a> (Free, Premium Subscription)</h2><br/>
Skiing and snowboarding app Slopes has an overhauled Apple Watch app that focuses on glanceability, which is what Apple is pushing for &zwnj;watchOS 10&zwnj;. You can swipe scroll through all of the different data options in the app with the Digital Crown, starting workouts, viewing elevation, distance traveled, and more.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/spark-ios-17-1.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-912194" /><br/>
You can start a recording on the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; and have it sync to the Apple Watch, and there is support for StandBy mode on &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; and the Smart Stack on the watch.<br/>
<h2>Other App Updates</h2><br/>
<ul><br/>
 	<li><a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/id956377119">World Clock Widgets</a> (Free, &#36;3.99 Pro unlock) - World Clock <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/home-screen/">Widgets</a> now includes StandBy support and new Lock Screen widgets for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>.</li><br/>
<li><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/halide-mark-ii-pro-camera/id885697368">Halide</a> (&#36;2.99/Month) - Camera app Halide includes improved HDR rendering, more responsive capture times, and a Zero Shutter Lag feature that better matches up image that's captured with what's visible in the viewfinder. Halide is available for &#36;2.99 per month, &#36;11.99 per year, or a one time purchase of &#36;59.99.</li><br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today released <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a> to the public, and there are hundreds of new features and changes for you to learn about. Some of these options require some set up to get up and running, so we've written this guide that walks you through what you should do after installing &zwnj;iOS 17&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/Just-Install-iOS-17-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-912098" /><br/>
<h2 id="set_up_your_standby_screen">Set Up Your StandBy Screen</h2><br/>
When you charge an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> running &zwnj;iOS 17&zwnj; in an upright and horizontal orientation, it displays a new StandBy screen. StandBy serves as a home hub to show glanceable information that makes your &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; more useful when it's not being actively used.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/StandBy-iOS-17.jpg" alt="" width="1960" height="1102" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-898860" /><br/>
StandBy is most useful on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-14-pro/">iPhone 14 Pro</a> models with always-on display, but it is available on all iPhones that run &zwnj;iOS 17&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
There are three total StandBy screens that you can access by swiping between them when your phone is in the appropriate StandBy position. The first screen displays widgets (including interactive widgets), the second showcases photos from the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/photos/">Photos</a> library, and the third is a large clock that shows the time.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/07/standby-widgets3.jpg" alt="standby" width="2700" height="1400" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-903252" /><br/>
You will want to customize your two widget stacks on the widget screen to make it more useful, and you can also customize how the time is displayed and the photos that you see. Customizing is done by swapping over to the correct screen and long pressing on it to get to the customization options.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/07/live-activity-standby.jpg" alt="" width="2494" height="1395" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-903436" /><br/>
StandBy can show you incoming notifications, Live Activities, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a> queries full screen. When you use StandBy with different <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe-battery-pack/">MagSafe</a> chargers in separate locations, you can customize your phone to remember which screen configuration you prefer based on location. For example, you might prefer widgets when at the office, or the clock screen when the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; is on your nightstand.<br/>
<br/>
StandBy can be a little bit complicated when you're not familiar with it, so we recommend <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ios-17-lock-screen/"><strong>looking through our StandBy guide</strong></a> to see the full extent of what you can do with it.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="prioritize_interactive_widgets">Prioritize Interactive Widgets</h2><br/>
Lock Screen and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/home-screen/">Home Screen</a> widgets are interactive in &zwnj;iOS 17&zwnj;, which makes widgets much more useful. You can do things like check off a reminder or activate a home device right from a widget without having to open an app.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/iOS-17-Interactive-Widgets.jpeg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-898611" /><br/>
Both Apple apps and third-party apps are able to use the new interactive functionality, so you might want to redo your widget setup now that certain widgets are more useful.<br/>
<br/>
Lock Screen widgets can be customized by long pressing on the Lock Screen, choosing a Lock Screen option, and then tapping "Customize." From there, select the Lock Screen and then tap into the widgets box to choose your widget options.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/reminders-widget.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-909624" /><br/>
On the &zwnj;Home Screen&zwnj;, long press, tap on the "+" button in the upper left corner, and select the widget that you want to add.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="customize_your_contact_poster">Customize Your Contact Poster</h2><br/>
In &zwnj;iOS 17&zwnj;, there's a customizable Contact Poster that people see when you call, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/facetime/">FaceTime</a>, or text them. You can customize it with a photo, Memoji, Animoji, or an initial, and choose the colors and fonts that you prefer.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/create-contact-poster-ios1.jpg" alt="contacts" width="4137" height="2716" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-910196" /><br/>
When you install &zwnj;iOS 17&zwnj;, you'll be prompted to make a Contact Poster, but you can tweak it at any time in the Contacts app. Just open Contacts, tap on "My Card" and then tap on "Edit" in the upper right corner to get to the editing interface.<br/>
<br/>
From there, you can choose a photo, select a color for the text, add a filter, and more. You can have multiple Contact Posters to swap between, and you can create a Contact Photo that's different from your Contact Poster.<br/>
<br/>
The Contact Poster and Contact Photo that you choose will be shared with others when you call or message them, but there are some settings you can use to restrict access. You can choose to share your photo and poster automatically with all of your contacts, or you can have your &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; get permission from you first. Name and photo sharing can also be disabled entirely if you prefer.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="make_sure_live_voicemail_is_on_u.s._and_canada_only">Make Sure Live Voicemail is On (U.S. and Canada Only)</h2><br/>
Live Voicemail is a new feature that lets you see a transcript of a voicemail as it's left, so you can pick up if it's an important call. You can make sure Live Voicemail is enabled by opening up the Settings app, tapping on Phone, scrolling down to Live Voicemail and toggling it on.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/Live-Voicemail-iOS-17.jpg" alt="" width="1306" height="793" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-898863" /><br/>
With the option turned on, when someone begins to leave a voicemail you will see a the transcript of what they have to say right on the Lock Screen. You can ignore it or answer the phone. During the beta testing process, Live Voicemail's wording was a bit confusing for callers, but Apple has since addressed that issue.<br/>
<br/>
If you find Live Voicemail irritating, toggling it off will disable it and your voicemail will return to normal.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="create_your_own_stickers">Create Your Own Stickers</h2><br/>
Apple in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-16/">iOS 16</a> added a Remove Subject from Background tool that lets you remove the primary object from any image. In &zwnj;iOS 17&zwnj;, when you use this feature, you can turn the subject of an image into a sticker.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/ios-17-stickers-create.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1299" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-898934" /><br/>
To get it to work, choose any photo with main subject. Do a short tap and hold on the subject of the image and at the text popup, choose "Add Sticker."<br/>
<br/>
From there, you can choose a sticker effect, such as adding a puffy look, including a white border, adding a glitter effect, and more. Some stickers will animate if they are pulled from a Live Photo, and the stickers that you can create can be used across the operating system.<br/>
<br/>
With &zwnj;iOS 17&zwnj;, Apple also merged emojis and stickers into one, so stickers work wherever you can use emoji.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="set_up_new_safari_profiles">Set Up New Safari Profiles</h2><br/>
In ‌&zwnj;iOS 17&zwnj;‌, Apple added a Profile feature that is designed to let you separate your browsing for different use cases. You can create a "Work" profile and a "Personal" profile, for example, so all of your work-related browsing is kept separate from your personal browsing.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/07/ios-17-safari-profiles.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-904920" /><br/>
Each profile has separate cookies, browsing history, extensions, and website data. You can turn off cookies and pop-ups on one profile, for instance, leaving them on for another profile. Profiles also have separate Favorites and Tab Groups.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/07/safari-profiles-set-up-ios-17.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-904922" /><br/>
To set up your separate profiles, open the Settings app, select Safari, tap on New Profile, and choose an icon, name, and background color.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="turn_on_anti-tracking">Turn on Anti-Tracking</h2><br/>
URLs in ‌&zwnj;iOS 17&zwnj;‌ can be stripped of all tracking information appended to the end of the URL so that websites cannot track your browsing using URL identifiers. This function is enabled automatically for private browsing in ‌&zwnj;iOS 17&zwnj;‌, but it can be turned on for all browsing.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/08/safari-advanced-tracking-prevention.jpg" alt="settings" width="4320" height="2700" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-905303" /><br/>
To turn it on, open up the Settings app and go to Safari. Tap on Advanced, then tap on "Advanced Tracking and Fingerprinting Protection." From there, toggle on "All Browsing." The setting will ensure that URLs opened in Safari will strip any tracking information at the end of a URL.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="share_your_icloud_keychain_passwords">Share Your iCloud Keychain Passwords</h2><br/>
&zwnj;iOS 17&zwnj; lets you securely share passwords and passkeys stored in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/icloud/">iCloud</a> Keychain with friends and family members. Through the sharing feature, passwords for media accounts, utilities, bills, and more can be accessed by multiple people.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/ios-17-shared-passwords.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1299" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-899239" /><br/>
Passwords can be shared by opening up the Passwords section in the Settings app and tapping on "Get Started" under the Share Passwords with Family banner. Alternatively, you can tap the "+" button and create a new shared group. You can have multiple separate password sharing groups with different people.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="name_your_pets_in_photos">Name Your Pets in Photos</h2><br/>
In the &zwnj;Photos&zwnj; app, the People album is now the Pets and People album because the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; can recognize dogs and cats. Once you've let your &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; charge for a bit, head into the Pets and People album and you'll be able to identify your pets and other animals that you have photos of, adding a name just like you can with people.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/ios-17-pets-photos.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1299" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-898923" /><br/>
You can review additional photos to add more, watch a slideshow, and more.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="log_a_mood">Log a Mood</h2><br/>
Apple added a mood tracking feature to the Health app in &zwnj;iOS 17&zwnj; so you can track your mental wellbeing over time. To get to it, open up the Health app, go to Browse, and tap on Mental Wellbeing. Choose Log under State of Mind, and you can select your mood<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/08/ios-17-mood-tracking.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-905973" /><br/>
You can set a mood for the current time or an overall mood for the entire day, choosing the factors that might have influenced your mood such as work or a relationship. You can see how your mood changes from week to week and what impacts how you're feeling.<br/>
<br/>
You can set up notifications to remind you to log your mood, and if you have an Apple Watch, you can do mood logging from your wrist.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="share_an_airtag">Share an AirTag</h2><br/>
<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airtags/">AirTags</a> can be shared with family members, so if your partner or your child borrows an item with an AirTag, they'll no longer get alerts about an unknown item traveling with them. This also goes for items that have <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/find-my-network-accessory-program/">Find My</a> integration.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/airtag-sharing-interface-ios-17.jpg" alt="" width="4620" height="3000" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-898524" /><br/>
To share a device, open up the &zwnj;Find My&zwnj; app and choose the items tag. Select an AirTag or an item and tap on Share This AirTag. From there, you can choose a contact to share the AirTag with.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="try_out_new_airpods_pro_2_features">Try Out New AirPods Pro 2 Features</h2><br/>
<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/">AirPods Pro</a> 2 have multiple new features in &zwnj;iOS 17&zwnj; that you'll want to test out. Adaptive Audio combines Active Noise Cancellation and Transparency into an all-in-one mode that adjusts the volume of what's playing based on what's around you and your interactions throughout the day.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/airpods-pro-2-purple.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-909566" /><br/>
With Conversation Awareness, the &zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj; 2 can detect when someone is speaking to you, turning down the volume of media and cutting down on background noise. Personalized Volume will also adjust the sound of what's playing based on personal preference and the sounds around you.<br/>
<br/>
Automatic Device Switching is also quicker, plus if you press on the stem of the &zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj; 2 while on a call, you can mute and unmute yourself. More on the new &zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj; 2 features <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ios-17-airpods/">can be found in our guide</a>.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today released <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a> to the public after months of beta testing, which means the new operating system update is available to all <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> users. &zwnj;iOS 17&zwnj; makes widgets far more useful than before, adding a new interactive element that allows you to use them from the Lock Screen, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/home-screen/">Home Screen</a>, or StandBy interface without having to open up an app.<br/>

<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-783453" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/02/HomePodandMini-feature-green.jpg" alt="" width="1436" height="808" /><br/>
When paired with a device running &zwnj;iOS 17&zwnj; or &zwnj;iPadOS 17&zwnj;, the &zwnj;HomePod&zwnj; can initiate an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airplay/">AirPlay</a> session using a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a> command, making it easier to listen to music services like Spotify on the &zwnj;HomePod&zwnj; over &zwnj;AirPlay&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
The update also adds new call controls for muting or unmuting a call, and there is an Enhance Dialogue feature on the &zwnj;HomePod&zwnj; 2 that can prioritize spoken voices when used with the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a> 4K. Apple's full release notes for the update are below.<blockquote>Software version 17 includes support for your HomePod. This update also includes bug fixes and stability improvements.<br/>
<br/>
- Siri support for AirPlay allows you to start an AirPlay session from your iPhone or iPad directly on your HomePod using just your voice, so you can play an even wider range of third-party music services on HomePod.<br/>
<br/>
- New call controls enable you to mute or unmute a call on HomePod.<br/>
<br/>
- Enhance Dialogue on HomePod (2nd generation) gives you the option to hear spoken voices more clearly over background sounds when paired with Apple TV 4K.</blockquote>‌‌‌‌‌&zwnj;HomePod&zwnj;‌‌‌‌‌‌ software is installed automatically on the ‌‌‌‌‌‌&zwnj;HomePod&zwnj;‌‌ unless the feature is disabled‌‌‌‌, but the ‌‌‌‌‌‌&zwnj;HomePod&zwnj;‌‌‌‌‌‌ can also be manually updated in the Home app by following the instructions in our <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/homepod-software-update/">HomePod‌‌ update how to</a>.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod-mini/">HomePod mini</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod/">HomePod</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Homepod-Mini">HomePod Mini (Neutral)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#HomePod">HomePod (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/homepod-homekit-carplay-home-auto-technology.193">HomePod, HomeKit, CarPlay, Home & Auto Technology</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/18/apple-releases-homepod-17-software/">Apple Releases HomePod 17 Software With Siri AirPlay Enhancement, New Mute Controls and More</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-releases-homepod-17-software-with-siri-airplay-enhancement-new-mute-controls-and-more.2403036/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today released <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/watchos-10/">watchOS 10</a>, the newest version of the watchOS operating system designed to run on the Apple Watch. &zwnj;watchOS 10&zwnj; is compatible with the Apple Watch Series 4 and later.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zkYQdi12gX8" title="watchOS 10: All NEW Features You Need to Know!" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe><em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/macrumors?sub_confirmation=1">Subscribe to the MacRumors YouTube channel</a> for more videos.</em></div><br/>
&zwnj;watchOS 10&zwnj;, which carries build number 21R356, can be downloaded for free through the Apple Watch app on an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> running <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a> by opening it up and going to General > Software Update. To install the new software, the Apple Watch needs to have at least 50 percent battery and it needs to be placed on a charger.<br/>
<br/>
With &zwnj;watchOS 10&zwnj;, Apple overhauled the Apple Watch interface with a renewed focus on widgets. Turning the Digital Crown now brings up the widget Smart Stack, which displays the information that you need most, and it changes throughout the day. The Control Center is now activated with the side button rather than a swipe.<br/>
<br/>
Apple's built-in apps have been simplified with an information-forward design that developers will also be adopting. Maps, Messages, Activity, Heart, Home, and more have been revamped. There are two new watch faces, including the colorful Palette face and the Snoopy face featuring characters from the popular cartoon.<br/>
<br/>
There are updated Activity integrations for cyclists, as well as location features in the Compass app for hikers. The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-maps/">Apple Maps</a> app now shows topography, hiking trails, and points of interest, and there's a new mood tracking feature that can be accessed in the Mindfulness app. Apple's full release notes for the update are below.<blockquote>watchOS 10 is the biggest update since the introduction of Apple Watch, and brings a fresh look for virtually every app, new ways to navigate, and a new Smart Stack to display the information you need, right when you need it, from any watch face. It introduces enhanced capabilities for cycling workouts and hiking, a new mental health experience in the Mindfulness app to reflect on your state of mind, and the ability to track the time you spend in daylight.<br/>
<br/>

- Solar Analog features classic hour marks on a luminous dial with light and shadow that shift throughout the day in response to the position of the sun<br/>

- Cycling Speed view shows current and max speed, distance, heart rate, and/or power<br/>
- Cycle metrics, workout views, and cycling experiences from your Apple Watch can now appear as a Live Activity on iPhone, which can be mounted to the handlebar of your bike<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Activity</strong><br/>
- Icons in the corners provide quick access to Weekly Summary, Sharing, and awards<br/>
- Move, Exercise, and Stand Rings are visible on individual screens by scrolling the Digital Crown along with the ability to adjust goals, view steps, distance, flights climbed, and activity history<br/>
- Weekly Summary now includes Exercise and Stand totals in addition to the Move total<br/>
- Activity Sharing shows photos or avatars of your friends<br/>
- Trainer Tips from the expert trainers at Fitness+ provide guidance on areas like workout techniques, mindfulness, healthy habits, and staying motivated in the Fitness app on iPhone<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<strong>Mindfulness</strong><br/>

<br/>
<strong>Medications</strong><br/>

		<description><![CDATA[While a tetraprism lens with up to 5x optical zoom is currently exclusive to the iPhone 15 Pro Max, the feature will expand to both the iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max next year, according to supply chain analyst Ming-Chi Kuo.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/03/iPhone-16-Mock-Header-1.jpg" alt="" width="2250" height="1266" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-888175" /><br/>
Kuo briefly revealed this information <a href="https://medium.com/@mingchikuo/iphone-15-pro-max%E7%9A%84%E4%BA%A4%E4%BB%98%E6%99%82%E9%96%93%E5%AE%8C%E5%85%A8%E5%8F%96%E6%B1%BA%E6%96%BC%E5%A4%A7%E7%AB%8B%E5%85%89%E7%8D%A8%E5%AE%B6%E4%BE%9B%E6%87%89%E4%B9%8B%E5%9B%9B%E9%87%8D%E5%8F%8D%E5%B0%84%E7%A8%9C%E9%8F%A1-%E6%BD%9B%E6%9C%9B%E9%8F%A1-%E9%8F%A1%E9%A0%AD%E4%B9%8B%E5%87%BA%E8%B2%A8%E9%87%8F-%E5%9B%9B%E9%87%8D%E5%8F%8D%E5%B0%84%E7%A8%9C%E9%8F%A1%E9%8F%A1%E9%A0%AD%E5%96%AE%E5%83%B9%E9%A1%AF%E8%91%97%E6%8F%90%E5%8D%8720-%E4%BB%A5%E4%B8%8A-iphone-15-pro-max-55a8711abb17">in a Medium post today</a> focused on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/18/kuo-apple-improving-iphone-15-pro-max-production/">iPhone 15 Pro Max production challenges</a> related to the camera.<br/>
<br/>
In the iPhone 15 Pro Max, the tetraprism lens system has a "folded" design that allows it to fit inside the smartphone, enabling <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/12/iphone-15-pro-max-25x-digital-zoom/">up to 5x optical zoom and up to 25x digital zoom</a>. By comparison, the smaller iPhone 15 Pro remains limited to up to 3x optical zoom, in line with the iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max.<br/>
<br/>
It has been rumored that the iPhone 16 Pro will feature a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/08/iphone-16-pro-larger-display-sizes/">larger 6.3-inch display</a>, compared to the 6.1-inch iPhone 15 Pro. This change would increase the overall size of the device, which would provide additional internal space for a tetraprism lens.<br/>
<br/>
This is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/16/iphone-16-pro-models-larger-periscope/">not the first time</a> that Kuo has said the lens would expand to both iPhone 16 Pro models, but it reveals that the change is still planned following the introduction of the iPhone 15 Pro Max, which launches this Friday.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/">Ming-Chi Kuo</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/18/iphone-16-pro-tetraprism-lens-rumor/">iPhone 15 Pro Max&#039;s 5x Optical Zoom Lens Rumored to Expand to Both iPhone 16 Pro Models</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-15-pro-maxs-5x-optical-zoom-lens-rumored-to-expand-to-both-iphone-16-pro-models.2403024/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple has urgently addressed production challenges related to the iPhone 15 Pro Max's upgraded Telephoto camera system in order to boost supply of the device, according to <a href="https://medium.com/@mingchikuo/iphone-15-pro-max%E7%9A%84%E4%BA%A4%E4%BB%98%E6%99%82%E9%96%93%E5%AE%8C%E5%85%A8%E5%8F%96%E6%B1%BA%E6%96%BC%E5%A4%A7%E7%AB%8B%E5%85%89%E7%8D%A8%E5%AE%B6%E4%BE%9B%E6%87%89%E4%B9%8B%E5%9B%9B%E9%87%8D%E5%8F%8D%E5%B0%84%E7%A8%9C%E9%8F%A1-%E6%BD%9B%E6%9C%9B%E9%8F%A1-%E9%8F%A1%E9%A0%AD%E4%B9%8B%E5%87%BA%E8%B2%A8%E9%87%8F-%E5%9B%9B%E9%87%8D%E5%8F%8D%E5%B0%84%E7%A8%9C%E9%8F%A1%E9%8F%A1%E9%A0%AD%E5%96%AE%E5%83%B9%E9%A1%AF%E8%91%97%E6%8F%90%E5%8D%8720-%E4%BB%A5%E4%B8%8A-iphone-15-pro-max-55a8711abb17">research shared today</a> by supply chain analyst Ming-Chi Kuo.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/f-4d62f49966d4af93a651379f09657fba6cc3c770.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="898" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-910268" /><br/>
Kuo said the iPhone 15 Pro Max's tetraprism camera module <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/12/iphone-15-pro-max-25x-digital-zoom/">with up to 5x optical zoom</a> has been the most significant supply bottleneck for the device. In response, he said Apple has increased the specifications of the tetraprism lens supplied by Largan Precision in order to compensate for this. As a result of this change, and to meet strong demand for the iPhone 15 Pro Max overall, Kuo said Largan Precision has expanded its production lines for the tetraprism lens.<br/>
<br/>
iPhone 15 Pro Max shipping estimates range from 3-4 weeks for some configurations to 6-7 weeks for others. Yesterday, Kuo said iPhone 15 Pro Max demand had <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/17/kuo-iphone-15-pro-max-robust-demand/">outpaced iPhone 14 Pro Max demand</a> during the same period last year.<br/>
<br/>
In addition to the camera-related bottleneck, Kuo previously said that the iPhone 15 Pro Max entered mass production later than the other devices in the iPhone 15 series, which has presumably contributed to the device's lengthy shipping delays. In the U.S., the iPhone 15 Pro Max starts at &#36;1,199 with 256GB of storage.<br/>
<br/>
All of the iPhone 15 models are now available to order and launch this Friday.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/">Ming-Chi Kuo</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-15-Pro">iPhone 15 Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/18/kuo-apple-improving-iphone-15-pro-max-production/">Kuo: Apple Urgently Addressing iPhone 15 Pro Max Production Challenges to Boost Supply</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/kuo-apple-urgently-addressing-iphone-15-pro-max-production-challenges-to-boost-supply.2403015/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a> models are available in a range of color options, with entirely new hues available on both sets of devices, as well as some popular classics. The &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a> lineups have different colors to choose from, so if you have your heart set on a particular shade, you may not be able to get your preferred model in that color. This guide focuses on the &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; models, but for more information about the color options of the &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; Max, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone-15-pro-color-options/">check out our other color options guide</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/iPhone-15-Colors-blue.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="898" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-911673" /><br/>
The &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; Plus are available in a total of five colors, two of which are entirely new for this year's lineup. Although previous standard <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> color options have tended to be bolder and brighter, in 2023, Apple chose to offer a much more muted color palette due to its color-infused frosted glass back. The &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; Plus's color options are as follows:<br/>
<br/>
<ul><br/>
<li>Black</li><br/>
<li>Blue</li><br/>
<li>Green</li><br/>
<li>Yellow</li><br/>
<li>Pink</li><br/>
</ul><br/>
<br/>
Previous years' "Midnight" is now simply "Black" once again. This returns as the standard model's darkest color option, differing from Midnight since it no longer has a slight hint of navy blue. "Starlight," which replaced "White" several years ago, is no longer available, and there is no equivalent to either of these light, neutral color options in the &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; lineup.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/iPhone-15-and-15-Plus-Newsroom.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="630" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-910395" /><br/>
All of the other new colors, Blue, Green, Yellow, and Pink, are pale, muted pastel shades, toning down some of the options available with the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-14/">iPhone 14</a>. While they are quite understated colors, the overall look is very distinctive to the &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj;'s more refined design.<br/>
<br/>
Unlike previous &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; lineups, there is no PRODUCT(RED) &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj;. Apple usually releases a new &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; color option in the spring, so a PRODUCT(RED) &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; could potentially be in the pipeline for early 2024.<br/>
<br/>
<h3 id="how_to_decide_on_a_color">How to Decide on a Color</h3><br/>
If you use your &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; with a case, you may wish to consider which device color will best complement your case. You may prefer a more neutral tone such as Black and use a more colorful case. Alternatively, you could choose a more striking device color like Green or Pink and use a more neutral case. A case is definitely a good option for a bolder look, especially since the &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj;'s color options are generally so muted and pale.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/iphone-15-finewoven-cases.jpg" alt="" width="2984" height="1198" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-910345" /><br/>
Black may age better over time as new devices are released since it is a neutral, monochrome shade, and has effectively been offered across multiple &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; generations. If you do not use a case at all, you may wish to take advantage of a more eye-catching color option such as Yellow.<br/>
<br/>
If you want an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; in a brand new color for this year, Pink and Green are the best options. These colors are the most noticeably new and clearly indicate that you have the latest-generation device.<br/>
<br/>
Your choice of color may also be dependent on how often you upgrade your ‌&zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;‌. If you upgrade every year, you may be more confident in buying a more striking new color. If you upgrade more often, it can be a good idea to get a different color every time. A new finish can certainly add some novelty to purchasing a new ‌&zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;‌ and make it feel more different from your previous device. Alternatively, if you tend to keep your ‌&zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;‌ for many years and upgrade less often, it may be wiser to consider a color that is more similar to one you have enjoyed previously.<br/>
<br/>
Customers with multiple Apple devices may also want to get an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; color that complements their other devices. For example, if you have a Pink <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-watch-series-9/">Apple Watch Series 9</a>, it will be best complemented by the Pink &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj;. Likewise, if you already have a Space Gray MacBook Pro, it will likely be best accompanied by a Black &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj;.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-15">iPhone 15 (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99">iPhone</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone-15-color-options/">iPhone 15 Color Options: Which Did You Choose?</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-15-color-options-which-did-you-choose.2403006/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[At its iPhone 15 event last week, Apple announced <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/12/apple-announces-usb-c-iphone-airpods-earpods/">updated second-generation AirPods Pro</a> with a USB-C charging case, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/12/new-airpods-pro-features/">additional dust resistance</a>, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/13/apple-vision-pro-lossless-new-airpods-pro-2-only/">support for lossless audio with Apple's upcoming Vision Pro headset</a>. Apple still classifies these as second-generation AirPods Pro, and it does not sell the USB-C case separately.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/AirPods-USB-C-Port-Red-Triad.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-911678" /><br/>
The updated AirPods Pro have been available to order since last week, and will begin arriving to customers and launch in stores on Friday. Ahead of time, select media outlets and YouTube channels have shared first impressions of the updated earbuds.<br/>
<br/>
There is minimal commentary about the hardware changes, with most reviews agreeing that there is little reason for existing second-generation AirPods Pro users to upgrade. USB-C is a convenient addition, additional dust resistance is welcomed, and lossless audio support cannot be tested until the Vision Pro launches in the U.S. in early 2024.<br/>
<br/>
iOS 17 adds several features to all second-generation AirPods Pro, including <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ios-17-airpods/">Adaptive Audio, Conversation Awareness, and Personalized Volume</a>. Keep in mind that these software features are also available on the original second-generation AirPods Pro released in September 2022, so there is no need to update to the USB-C model to use them.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="https://www.theverge.com/23878402/apple-airpods-pro-usb-c-adaptive-audio-conversation-awareness-test-review"><em>The Verge</em>'s Chris Welch</a> on Adaptive Audio:<blockquote>Adaptive Audio is meant to be a set-it-and-forget-it mode that blends active noise cancellation and transparency, canceling loud distractions where needed while also helping you stay present in your environment. In my experience so far, this feature rarely cancels my surroundings to the same degree as the full noise cancellation mode (I wouldn’t use it on a plane), but it reduces outside sound enough to not take away from my music — even at lower volumes. To my ears so far, it’s basically an even smarter version of the adaptive transparency that Apple debuted with last year’s AirPods Pro.</blockquote><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/09/18/airpods-pro-get-usb-c-and-a-few-new-tricks/"><em>TechCrunch</em>'s Brian Heater</a> on Conversation Awareness:<blockquote>Conversational Awareness is a nice addition. It uses a combination of different sensors to determine when you’re talking. That includes obvious things like built-in mics, coupled with more surprising elements like the accelerometer, which detects vibration to determine that you are, in fact, the one who is talking, without having to resort to something like voice recognition. When that's triggered, the audio begins to lower, effectively getting out of your way when talking.<br/>
<br/>
I was impressed by the detection. It didn't trigger when I, say, coughed, yawned or cleared my throat. When I started talking, however, the music began to lower. It doesn't stay down for any specific set amount of time. The company says it relies on an algorithm to determine such things. Factors include the length of time you're talking, so it doesn't mistake a break in conversation for the end of one.</blockquote><a href="https://www.thestreet.com/deals/apple-airpods-pro-usb-c-review-adaptive-audio#adaptive-mode-is-a-smart-combination-of-transparency-and-noise-cancellation"><em>TheStreet</em>'s Jacob Krol</a> on both Adaptive Audio and Conversation Awareness:<blockquote>It feels almost magical as it works as intended. For instance, sitting in a bustling hotel lobby, you'll encounter background noise and chatter from other patrons nearby; once I engaged Adaptive, it lowers the brunt of the noise, and with music playing, it all becomes very faint. If a louder noise appears, like a cart being pushed through the space, it will process it in real time and lower it specifically.<br/>
<br/>
Let's take a more likely or commonly occurring scenario—I'm walking around my apartment with AirPods Pro, listening to some music with Adaptive on. It lowers the brunt of my HVAC system, similar to how the ANC performs, but I can hear a faint knock on my door as I'm expecting a package from FedEx. I open the door, and thanks to Conversation Awareness turned on, I can start talking, and AirPods Pro automatically switches to Transparency mode.<br/>
</blockquote><a href="https://www.inverse.com/tech/airpods-pro-2nd-gen-usb-c-review"><em>Inverse</em>'s Raymond Wong</a> on Personalized Volume:<blockquote>Personalized Volume uses machine learning to automatically adjust the volume just for your ears. Apple says Personalized Volume is determined by "environmental conditions and volume selections" over time. I didn't notice any meaningful volume adjustments over a week of testing so I turned it off.</blockquote><h2>Videos</h2><br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Amazon today has a collection of deals on Apple's iPad, including the 9th and 10th generation models. Both sales include matches of all-time low prices on these tablets.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>10th Gen iPad</h2><br/>
Starting with Apple's 10th generation 64GB Wi-Fi iPad, this model is available at the all-time low price of <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0BJLCL22Y%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1"><strong>&#36;399.00</strong></a>, down from &#36;449.00. The soonest the iPad can be delivered is around September 20, but some colors are seeing dates extend into October.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Three colors are on sale, including Yellow, Blue, and Pink. You won't need any coupon code in order to get these record low prices, as they have been applied automatically by Amazon.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0BJLCL22Y%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1"target="_blank"><div class="fancybutton"><div class="fancybadge">&#36;50 OFF</div>10th Gen iPad (64GB Wi-Fi) for &#36;399.00</div></a></div><br/>

The 256GB Wi-Fi iPad is on sale for <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0BJLXMVMW%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"><strong>&#36;549.00</strong></a> in every color (&#36;50 off).

<br/>
<h2>9th Gen iPad</h2><br/>
There's also a solid discount on the previous-generation 9th generation iPad this week on Amazon. You can get the 64GB Wi-Fi iPad for <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB09G9CJM1Z%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"><strong>&#36;269.99</strong></a>, down from &#36;329.00.

		<description><![CDATA[It's taken this long, but in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a>, Apple has added support for multiple timers, and has also made it easy to manage several timers on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> with the introduction of labels. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/set-multiple-timers-ios.jpg" alt="timers" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-912030" /><br/>
That's right. Believe it or not, iPhones have not included the ability to set multiple ongoing timers until now. In &zwnj;iOS 17&zwnj;, the Clock app finally enables several timers to be set that will run down at the same time, allowing you to keep track of more than one thing, which is handy when cooking a meal that includes several dishes, for example.<br/>
<br/>
Not only can you have several timers counting down at the same time, you can also label timers, which helps you identify each one in your timer list. That way, you'll always know which timer relates to what, and you can save custom timers without having to remember what they were set up for.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/siri-suggestion-set-a-timer.jpg" alt="siri" width="1339" height="725" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-912032" /><br/>
To quickly set a timer on &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;, swipe down on the Home screen, search "timer," and tap the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a> Suggestion, or to set a timer with a name, say "&zwnj;Siri&zwnj;, set a timer called [name] for [duration]." Alternatively, open the Clock app and tap the Timers tab. In the timer setup options, select a duration, then tap the Label field and type in what you want to call it. <br/>
<br/>
Choose a distinct alert for the timer if it helps you recognize it. Note that in &zwnj;iOS 17&zwnj;, you also have the option of selecting one of several preset durations in the setup screen. When a timer is set, it will be added to your editable list of timers. For added convenience, the list will also include any recently completed timers that you used. <br/>
<br/>

If your &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; has a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/dynamic-island/">Dynamic Island</a>, the last timer you set will appear inside it when you are doing other things on your device. The most recently set timer will also appear as a Live Activity on the Lock Screen, and you can tap to expand it and see any other timers that are running concurrently. <br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/use-label-multiple-timers-ios/">iOS 17: How to Set and Label Multiple Timers</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-17-how-to-set-and-label-multiple-timers.2402991/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[At its "Wonderlust" event in 2023, alongside the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-watch-series-9/">Apple Watch Series 9</a>, Apple announced the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch-ultra/">Apple Watch Ultra 2</a>. The Apple Watch Ultra is a relatively new kind of smartwatch from Apple with a focus on withstanding extreme environments, a high level of durability, extended battery life, and additional features to aid activities like diving and exploration.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/Apple-Watch-Series-9-vs-Ultra-2-Buyers-Guide.jpg" alt="" width="2250" height="1265" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-911647" /><br/>
Both the &zwnj;Apple Watch Series 9&zwnj; and the &zwnj;Apple Watch Ultra 2&zwnj; feature the S9 chip, a second-generation Ultra Wideband chip, an Always-On Retina display, IP6X dust resistance, and more, but there are significant differences between the two devices.<br/>
<br/>
With as little as &#36;50 between the 45mm stainless steel &zwnj;Apple Watch Series 9&zwnj; and the Apple Watch Ultra, some prospective customers will be weighing up whether it is worth spending a little extra to get the 49mm Ultra model. While there is a &#36;400 difference between the 41mm aluminum &zwnj;Apple Watch Series 9&zwnj; and the Apple Watch Ultra, the high-end model offers a set of features to address specific challenges, so it may even be worth it for some of these buyers.<br/>

The Apple Watch Ultra offers specific capabilities to address the requirements of those who need their Apple Watch to provide assistance in challenging environments. If you need a more durable Apple Watch with features like a brighter display, louder speakers, a more reliable GPS, better water resistance, and more, the Apple Watch Ultra is undoubtedly the best choice. <br/>
<br/>
The Apple Watch Ultra is also the largest and most feature-rich Apple Watch option available, not to mention that it offers the first true redesign of the device since its introduction in 2015. For technology enthusiasts, Apple Watch Ultra represents a way to get a new Apple Watch experience with the top specifications. Features like longer battery life and a larger, brighter display are also highly accessible, and will be beneficial to all users. As such, some customers may still be inclined to choose the &zwnj;Apple Watch Ultra 2&zwnj; over the &zwnj;Apple Watch Series 9&zwnj;, even if they do not need it for use in challenging environments.<br/>
<br/>
As the largest Apple Watch model to date, the size of the Apple Watch Ultra will not be for everyone. If you already prefer the 41mm Apple Watch casing size, the Apple Watch Ultra may be far too large for you. If in doubt, it may be worth heading to an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-store/">Apple Store</a> and trying on the Apple Watch Ultra in person to get to grips with the size and determine if it is too big and bulky for you. <br/>
<br/>
Similarly, the Apple Watch Ultra's look may not appeal to some buyers. If you prefer the stainless steel Apple Watch and are looking for a more fashion-focused smartwatch that pairs well with premium bands, the more aggressive, rugged design of the Apple Watch Ultra may not be for you. <br/>
<br/>
If the Apple Watch Ultra is out of your price range but you still want to use your Apple Watch in challenging environments, it is worth bearing in mind that the Series 9 still offers a durable design with a strong front crystal, water resistance, and many of the &zwnj;Apple Watch Ultra 2&zwnj;'s software features like waypoint marking.<br/>
<br/>
The &zwnj;Apple Watch Ultra 2&zwnj; has a lot to offer, especially for the subset of users who can take advantage of all of its capabilities, so it is certainly worth considering when purchasing a new model, but the &zwnj;Apple Watch Series 9&zwnj; is still a compelling all-around option that comes in at a lower price point with a subtler design.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch/">Apple Watch Series 9</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch-ultra/">Apple Watch Ultra 2</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch">Apple Watch (Buy Now)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch_Ultra">Apple Watch Ultra (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-watch.172">Apple Watch</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-watch-series-9-vs-ultra-2/">Apple Watch Series 9 vs. Ultra 2 Buyer&#039;s Guide: 25 Differences Compared</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-watch-series-9-vs-ultra-2-buyers-guide-25-differences-compared.2402984/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[ProRes video recording remains limited to 1080p quality at 30 frames per second on the 128GB model of the iPhone 15 Pro, unless the device is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/13/iphone-15-pro-external-storage-prores/">recording directly to a connected external storage drive</a>, according to Apple. On the 256GB and higher iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max, ProRes video recording is supported in up to 4K quality at 60 frames per second to both internal storage and external storage.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/iPhone-15-Pro-lineup.jpg" alt="" width="2880" height="1620" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-910338" /><br/>
Apple does not mention this information on the iPhone 15 Pro's tech specs page on its website, but the limitation is listed when comparing the iPhone 15 Pro to another iPhone model in the Apple Store app, as seen in the screenshot below.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/iPhone-15-Pro-128GB-ProRes.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-912008" /><br/>
The same limitation applied to iPhone 13 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro models with 128GB of storage, but those devices cannot record ProRes video to external storage, so at least iPhone 15 Pro users have that option this time around. The limitation does not apply to the iPhone 15 Pro Max, as that model starts with 256GB of storage.<br/>
<br/>
ProRes video files are very large. Apple says a one-minute 10-bit ProRes video is approximately 1.7GB in 1080p and 6GB in 4K. Apple likely feels that offering 4K ProRes video recording to internal storage on the 128GB model would be a subpar user experience. With recording to an external storage now an option, it is less of an issue.<br/>
<br/>
Introduced on the iPhone 13 Pro models, ProRes refers to a family of codecs from Apple that can compress videos into smaller file sizes with "impressive image quality preservation." Apple says ProRes is designed as a final delivery format for high-quality videos like commercials, feature films, and broadcasts.<br/>
<br/>
ProRes video recording is still not supported at all on the standard iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-15-Pro">iPhone 15 Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/18/iphone-15-pro-128gb-prores-1080p-only/">Apple Says 128GB iPhone 15 Pro Limited to 1080p ProRes Video Recording Unless External Storage Connected</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-says-128gb-iphone-15-pro-limited-to-1080p-prores-video-recording-unless-external-storage-connected.2402975/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

<br/>

Last year, the biggest new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone-14-vs-iphone-14-pro/">differences between the iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Pro</a> were always-on functionality, the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/dynamic-island/">Dynamic Island</a>, three hours of battery life, and rear cameras with different apertures. With &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj;, both devices share new features like the USB-C port, second-generation Ultra Wideband chip, and next-generation portraits, but Apple's "Pro" and non-Pro &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; models are more different than ever.<br/>
<br/>
Our guide helps to answer the question of how to decide which of these two &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; models is best for you, and serves as a way to clearly see what additional features and upgrades the &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; brings to the table.<br/>

The &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; offers a large number of upgrades over the standard &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj;. With just &#36;200 difference to obtain a display with ProMotion and always-on functionality, the Action Button, and longer battery life, many customers will be able to justify getting the &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; over the &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj;. Other differences, such as the A17 Pro chip and 2GB additional memory are notable, but most significant are perhaps the devices' fundamentally different rear camera setups. The &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; unlocks 10 additional camera features and offers four additional or different pieces of camera hardware. Due to the scale and breadth of the &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj;'s improvements and features, most customers will be happy to choose the high-end model.<br/>
<br/>
The standard &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; still offers many of the &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj;'s most compelling capabilities, such as USB-C, &zwnj;Dynamic Island&zwnj;, and a 48-megapixel main camera, at a lower price point. It will only be worth getting the &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; over the &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; if you want a lighter device, do not care for the "Pro" rear camera setup or features like ProMotion and the always-on display, or cannot justify the &#36;200 to upgrade to the high-end model. In this instance, you will still benefit from the device's generous roster of advanced features. The &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; is still a very well designed and balanced device, especially for average customers and those coming from a much older model.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-15">iPhone 15 (Buy Now)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-15-Pro">iPhone 15 Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99">iPhone</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone-15-vs-iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 vs. iPhone 15 Pro Buyer&#039;s Guide: 35+ Differences Compared</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-15-vs-iphone-15-pro-buyers-guide-35-differences-compared.2402964/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple CEO Tim Cook confirmed in an interview with <em>CBS Sunday Morning</em>'s John Dickerson that the company's Vision Pro headset remains on schedule for release in early 2024, and revealed that he's already using it on a regular basis. <br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/M-FBYmIhRoo?si=Xf7CJ11sifs_ojXP" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><br/>
When asked how he uses the upcoming headset, Cook said he watched "the entire third season of 'Ted Lasso' on the Vision Pro," and admitted there are "some things I have access to that other people don't have access to, so I'm doing that, but that I can't talk to you about."<br/>
<br/>
Cook went on to say that the challenges Apple has faced creating the headset are "more complex" than making something like the iPhone, so it requires "more innovation, not only in the development but also in the manufacturing." However, the Apple chief batted away any suggestion that the company was <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/07/03/apple-vision-pro-drastic-production-cuts/">facing production issues</a> with the Vision Pro, saying the device was "on track" for a launch early next year.<br/>
<br/>
In the course of the interview, Cook also touched on other topics including Apple's environmental initiatives (he hopes other companies "rip it off"), whether Apple should be advertising on X, formerly known as Twitter, when its owner Elon Musk has been accused of promoting anti-Semitism on the platform ("It's something we constantly ask ourselves"), and the post-pandemic return to working in the office. <br/>
<br/>
In between a walk-and-talk around Apple's Austin, Texas campus, Cook was also filmed taking a sales call with a surprised customer. "The caller wanted to upgrade their iPhone," Cook later explained to Dickerson. When asked if he told her to hold out for the iPhone 15, Cook laughed. "I didn't exactly say that."   <br/>

		<title>How to Find Your Apple TV Siri Remote Using Your iPhone</title>

		<description><![CDATA[In iOS 17 and tvOS 17, Apple has added a feature that lets Apple TV users locate a misplaced Siri Remote using their iPhone. Keep reading to learn how it's done.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/find-siri-remote-iphone.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-911918" /><br/>
Prior to the launch of the latest ‌Apple TV‌ 4K, there were rumors that Apple would build ‌Find My‌ functionality into the ‌Siri‌ Remote. That didn't happen, but in its latest major software updates, Apple has introduced a new iPhone option that does essentially the same thing. <br/>
<br/>
In early September, Apple quietly released new firmware for its second and third-generation Siri Remotes. With the new firmware, tvOS 17, and iOS 17, if a ‌Siri‌ Remote becomes lost, the ‌Apple TV‌ remote control available in the Control Center on an ‌iPhone‌ can be used to locate the missing remote.<br/>
<br/>
When enabled, users will see a Find My-like interface on their iPhone that guides them toward the remote, with an onscreen circle that changes in size to guide movement in the right direction. <br/>
<br/>
Note that Find My for the ‌Siri‌ Remote is available on the second and third-generation ‌Siri‌ Remotes, and the feature is limited to the ‌Apple TV‌ 4K models released in 2021 and 2022.<br/>
<br/>
Also, bear in mind that the updated firmware is necessary, and there is no established method for getting the ‌Siri‌ Remote to update. The ‌Apple TV‌ will need to be up to date, on, and connected to the ‌Siri‌ Remote to initiate, but there is no way to force the new firmware to download.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Find Your Siri Remote With Your iPhone</h2><br/>
<ol><li>Bring up the Control Center from your iPhone by swiping down from the upper right corner of the screen (on an ‌iPhone‌ with a Home button, swipe up from the bottom of the screen).</li><br/>
<li>Tap the <strong>Apple TV Remote</strong> button (if it's not there, you can <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/customize-control-center-ios-11/#customize">manually add it to Control Center</a>).</li><br/>
<li>Tap the chevron next to the name of the connected Siri Remote.<br/>

<li>Tap the <strong>Find</strong> button next to the misplaced Siri Remote.</li><br/>
<li>Use the onscreen Find My-like interface to locate the remote. The size of the circle increases to guide movement in the correct direction. When your iPhone is right next to the remote, the screen shows a solid white orb.</li><br/>
<li>Tap the <strong>X</strong> button to close the location interface.<br/>
