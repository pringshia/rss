		<description><![CDATA[In addition to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/17/macbook-pro-air-get-discounts/">great deals on MacBook Pro and MacBook Air</a>, Best Buy this weekend has deep markdowns on a variety of iPads. This includes all-time low prices on the 10th generation iPad and 5th generation iPad Air, as well as a few solid discounts on iPad mini 6 and 9th generation iPad.<br/>
<br/>

<h2>iPad</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/ipad-yellow-best-buy.jpg" alt="" width="2250" height="1266" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-936881" /><br/>
The cheapest iPad in this sale is the 64GB Wi-Fi 9th generation iPad at <a href="https://howl.me/clEadOydYiR"><strong>&#36;249.99</strong></a>, down from &#36;329.00. For a more recent model, Best Buy has the 64GB Wi-Fi 10th generation iPad at <a href="https://howl.me/clAKavBDVPi"><strong>&#36;349.00</strong></a>, which is an all-time low price at &#36;100 off.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<h2>iPad Air</h2><br/>

Similarly, Best Buy has every model of the 5th generation iPad Air on sale at an all-time low price, starting at <a href="https://howl.me/clxkYXiXGKb"><strong>&#36;449.99</strong></a> for the 64GB Wi-Fi tablet, down from &#36;599.00.

Lastly, the 64GB Wi-Fi iPad mini 6 is down to &#36;399.99 this weekend at Best Buy, from &#36;499.00. You can also get the 256GB Wi-Fi tablet for &#36;549.99, which is another &#36;99 discount. These two sales are second-best prices on the iPad mini 6.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Best Buy has a big <a href="https://howl.me/clD9T1Uiz5Q">Presidents' Day sale</a> happening this weekend, and it includes some of the best prices we've ever seen on Apple's MacBook Air and MacBook Pro. This event will last through the weekend and end on Monday, February 19. <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/16/best-buy-presidents-day-sale/">Our article from yesterday</a> has a deeper dive into everything being discounted during the sale.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/macbook-bb-sale.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-935644" /><em><small>Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with Best Buy. When you click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment, which helps us keep the site running.</small></em><br/>
<br/>
Some of these deals (particularly the MacBook Pro discounts) require a <a href="https://howl.me/clsfFR2NQAO">My Best Buy Plus or My Best Buy Total membership</a>, which start at &#36;49.99/year. In addition to exclusive access to select discounts, you'll get free 2-day shipping, an extended 60-day return window, and more.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>MacBook Air</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/macbook-air-blue-feb.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-935647" /><br/>
The highlight of the MacBook Air deals is on the 256GB M2 15-inch MacBook Air, priced at <a href="https://howl.me/clwvUhPbHPL"><strong>&#36;999.00</strong></a>, down from &#36;1,299.00. You can also get the 512GB M2 model on sale at <a href="https://howl.me/clwvVizVdRk"><strong>&#36;1,199.00</strong></a>, down from &#36;1,499.00. Both of these &#36;300 discounts are a match for the best prices we've ever seen on the M2 15-inch MacBook Air.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://howl.me/clALl0A1vd6"target="_blank"><div class="fancybutton"><div class="fancybadge">&#36;250 OFF</div>13-inch M1 MacBook Air (256GB) for &#36;749.99</div></a></div><br/>

<br/>
You can also find solid discounts on the M2 13-inch MacBook Air and M1 13-inch MacBook Air during Best Buy's new sale. Prices on the M2 models begin at <a href="https://howl.me/clEaauQLFYE"><strong>&#36;949.00</strong></a> and prices on the M1 models begin at <a href="https://howl.me/clD970RKWuk"><strong>&#36;749.99</strong></a>, both of which are matching previous record low discounts.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>MacBook Pro</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/macbook-pro-blue-feb.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-935646" /><br/>
There are a few more MacBook Pro discounts than MacBook Air discounts, but they will all require a My Best Buy Plus or Total membership. If you don't have one, you can still get solid second-best prices on these computers at Best Buy this weekend.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><em><strong>Note: My Best Buy Plus/Total membership required to see final deal price.</strong></em></div><br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://howl.me/clALsjD0UdF"target="_blank"><div class="fancybutton"><div class="fancybadge">&#36;200 OFF</div>M3 14-inch MacBook Pro (512GB) for &#36;1,399.00</div></a></div><br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Amazon today has the Apple Pencil 2 for the new all-time low price of <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB07K1WWBJK%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"><strong>&#36;79.00</strong></a>, down from &#36;129.00. There's an estimated delivery date of Monday, February 19 for Prime members, and no coupon code is required to get this deal.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/05/apple-pencil-memorial-day.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-897359" /><em><small>Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with Amazon. When you click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment, which helps us keep the site running.</small></em><br/>
<br/>
This is the first major discount on the Apple Pencil 2 in 2024, and it beats the low price we tracked during the holidays by about &#36;10. The Apple Pencil 2 is compatible with the following iPads: iPad mini (6th generation), iPad Air (4th generation and later), 12.9-inch iPad Pro (3rd generation and later), and 11-inch iPad Pro (1st generation and later). <br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB07K1WWBJK%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"target="_blank"><div class="fancybutton"><div class="fancybadge">&#36;50 OFF</div>Apple Pencil 2 for &#36;79.00</div></a></div><br/>
<br/>
If you have the newest iPad Pro models, the second-generation Apple Pencil can now be detected while hovering up to 12mm above the display. This allows users to see a preview of their drawing before they make it, and with Scribble text fields automatically expand when the pencil gets near the screen.<br/>
<br/>
If you're looking for the Apple Pencil with USB-C that launched in 2023, Amazon has a smaller &#36;10 discount on that model. It's available for <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0CL7J12YK%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"><strong>&#36;69.99</strong></a>, down from &#36;79.00.

		<description><![CDATA[After over a year of reports, there are now over a dozen specific rumors about the features and improvements set to be offered by the two non-Pro <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a> models later in 2024. <br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/iPhone-15-vs-16-Feature-Yellow-Pink.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-936647" /></div><br/>
All of the changes the &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; models are expected to feature compared to their direct forerunners are listed below, using information from a range of reliable sources that we have <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">previously covered</a>. We will update this article as more rumors emerge in the coming months.<br/>
<br/>
This guide focuses on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a> and &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj;, but to learn about how we are expecting the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/">iPhone 16 Pro</a> to improve on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone-15-pro-vs-iphone-16-pro/">see our other comparison article</a>. <br/>
<br/>
<h3 id="design">Design</h3><br/>
The &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; Plus are expected to largely carry over the design of their predecessors, meaning that they will have the same dimensions. The most noticeable alteration that will denote the new models is said to be a vertical rear camera arrangement to facilitate spatial video capture, but the removal of the mute switch in favor of the Action button introduced on last year's Pro models and the introduction of an all-new "Capture" button will also be important changes.<br/>
<br/>

<div class="clear"></div><br/>
<br/>
<h3 id="chip_memory_and_connectivity">Chip, Memory, and Connectivity</h3><br/>
The &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; models are rumored to benefit from a moderate improvement in processing power thanks to an all-new A18 chip with a more power Neural Engine to support exclusive generative AI capabilities. We are also expecting 33% more memory and Wi-Fi 6E support.<br/>

<h3 id="batteries_and_charging">Batteries and Charging</h3><br/>
The &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; models could receive some major improvements in battery technology and charging, sporting denser batteries and faster charging capabilities. It is worth noting that the &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; Plus is rumored to feature a smaller battery than its predecessor, but it is not clear how this will affect actual battery life. <br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's next set of product releases is likely coming up quickly, with a number of Mac and iPad updates reportedly set for next month. Major changes to iOS are coming to residents of the European Union around the same time, while rumors continue to circulate about a potential HomePod with a full display.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/top-stories-17feb2024.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-936792" /><br/>
Other news this week included fresh rumors about the iPhone 16 lineup and iOS 18 coming later in the year, while Apple is investigating reports of screen-related issues on the latest Apple Watch models, so read on below for all the details!<br/>
<br/>
<h2>New MacBook Airs and iPads, iOS 17.4, and More Expected Next Month</h2><br/>
Now that Apple has launched its Vision Pro headset, attention has shifted towards <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/12/what-to-expect-from-apple-in-march-2024/">what is next on the company's agenda</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/New-Macs-iPads-iOS-17-4.jpg" alt="" width="3198" height="1798" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-936049" /><br/>
As usual, March should be a busy time for Apple, as the company is expected to release new MacBook Air, iPad Pro, and iPad Air models during the month. In a recent press release, Apple also confirmed that the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/04/ios-17-4-new-features-and-changes/">iOS 17.4 update for the iPhone will be released in March</a>.<br/>
<br/>
For more information, read our <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/12/what-to-expect-from-apple-in-march-2024/">recap of what to expect from Apple in March</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>iPhone 16 Rumored to Feature 'Significantly' Upgraded Neural Engine for iOS 18's Generative AI Features</h2><br/>
Apple's next-generation A18 and M4 chips for iPhone 16 models and future Macs will <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/14/iphone-16-upgraded-neural-engine-rumor/">feature upgraded Neural Engines with "significantly" more cores</a>, according to Taiwan's <em>Economic Daily News</em>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/iOS-18-Mock-iPhone-16-Feature-Gray.jpg" alt="" width="2250" height="1266" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-936483" /><br/>
iOS 18 is rumored to include <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/22/apple-generative-ai-features-and-smarter-siri/">new generative AI features</a> for Siri, Shortcuts, Messages, Apple Music, and more, and an upgraded Neural Engine would boost performance for AI/machine learning tasks. <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/15/apple-xcode-ai-tool-for-coding/">Xcode may also gain an AI tool.</a><br/>
<br/>
<h2>tvOS 17.4 Allegedly Hints at HomePod With Display</h2><br/>
The tvOS 17.4 beta for the Apple TV allegedly includes <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/13/tvos-17-4-homepod-display/">code-level references to an unreleased HomePod with a built-in display</a>, according to <em>9to5Mac</em>.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/05/HomePod-With-Screen-and-Arm-FaceTime-Feature-2.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-801481" /><em>Concepts for HomePod with larger display, based on circulating rumors</em></div><br/>
Last year, Apple supply chain analyst Ming-Chi Kuo predicted that Apple would <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/10/homepod-with-7-inch-display-to-launch-in-2024/">release a new HomePod with a 7-inch screen in the first half of 2024</a>, so the device could be nearing launch, barring any delays. Apple often holds its first media event of the year in March.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg Says Quest 3 is Better Than Apple Vision Pro</h2><br/>
In a video shared on his Instagram page this week, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said his company's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/13/meta-quest-3-apple-vision-pro-zuckerberg/">Quest 3 mixed reality headset is better than Apple's Vision Pro</a> headset for the majority of tasks.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/meta-quest-3.jpg" alt="" width="1385" height="779" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-914163" /><br/>
Zuckerberg provided many reasons for his opinion, as outlined <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/13/meta-quest-3-apple-vision-pro-zuckerberg/">in our coverage</a>. In the U.S., the Quest 3 starts at &#36;499.99, making it a much more affordable option compared to the Vision Pro, which starts at &#36;3,499.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>iOS 18: All the Rumors and New Features Expected So Far</h2><br/>
iOS 18 is still months away from being unveiled, but there are already rumors and expectations for the software update, as <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/15/ios-18-features-and-rumors/">outlined in our recap</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/iOS-18-Everything-So-Far-Thumb-1.jpg" alt="" width="2250" height="1266" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-924581" /><br/>
iOS 18 is rumored to include new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/15/ios-18-features-and-rumors/">ChatGPT-like generative AI features</a> for Siri and select apps, and RCS support in the Messages app for an improved texting experience with Android users. A sketchy rumor claimed that iOS 18 will also have some visionOS-inspired design changes.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Apple Investigating Screen-Related Issue Affecting Some Apple Watches</h2><br/>
In an internal memo shared with Apple Authorized Service Providers last week, Apple said it is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/13/apple-watch-false-touches-issue/">"investigating" a screen-related issue affecting some Apple Watch Series 9 and Apple Watch Ultra 2 displays</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/Apple-Watch-Series-9.jpg" alt="" width="2880" height="1620" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-910331" /><br/>
​"Some customers may report their Apple Watch Series 9 or Apple Watch Ultra 2 is experiencing false touches on their display," the memo says. The issue may cause the screen on affected Apple Watch models to "jump erratically" or exhibit other unexpected behavior, without any user interaction.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[If you're an ‌‌iPhone‌‌ user you know how the Messages app works. But when Apple released iOS 17 last year, it introduced an overhauled interface for the Messages app that includes several useful hidden functions and customization options that might not be obvious to the average user. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/07/iOS-17-Messages-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2250" height="1266" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-903379" /><br/>
Below, we've collected 10 of our favorite tips that we hope will make your Messages experience more convenient and enjoyable.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="1._faster_access_to_photo_library">1. Faster Access to Photo Library</h2><br/>
Previously in iOS 16, sharing photos involved tapping the Photos icon in the row of apps below the text input field to access your Camera Roll. But in ‌iOS 17‌ the ‌Photos‌ button is gone, which makes it appear as though you have to tap the + button to the left of the text field to reveal the option.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/1messages-photo-access.jpg" alt="photos messages" width="2738" height="1469" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-936912" /><br/>
Thankfully, accessing your photos doesn't have to involve two steps instead of one. If you press and hold the + button, you will be dropped straight into your photo library, ready to select the pictures you want to send.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/2messages-photo-access.jpg" alt="messages photos" width="1338" height="1043" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-936913" /><br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="2._customize_messages_menu">2. Customize Messages Menu</h2><br/>
When you tap the "+" button in Messages to bring up the column of options, they are arranged in a default order. From the top, there's Camera, Photos, Stickers, Cash (where available), Audio, and Location. At the very bottom is a More button which when tapped reveals any other installed Messages apps (you can also swipe up to reveal this hidden list).<br/>
<br/>
You can reorganize the apps in the list and bring your most-used apps nearer to the top, and even bring up more apps from the "More" section to the first screen of options, in the following way.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/08/move-imessage-apps.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-905326" /><br/>
To move an app within the same screen, press and hold on its icon, then drag it to your preferred location and let go. To move an app up to the first page of icons, simply do the same, but drag it up to the top of the screen and place it where you want.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="3._quicker_replies">3. Quicker Replies</h2><br/>
Before iOS 17, replying to a specific chat bubble in the Messages app involved long pressing on it, then hitting reply. But Apple's swipe to reply feature speeds up the process, and helps you keep track of which message bubble you're replying to with some visual cues.<br/>
<ol><li>Select an iMessage conversation, find the specific message you want to reply to, then swipe right on it.</li><br/>
<li>The selected message will be highlighted and a text box will appear, allowing you to type your reply and hit Send.</li><br/>
<li>To return to the main conversation, tap the blurred background.</li></ol><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/swipe-to-reply.jpg" alt="messages" width="4050" height="2716" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-933820" /><br/>
<br/>
Notice the visual thread that indicates the nested connection between your reply and the original message, which is particularly helpful in group conversations to keep track of who is replying to whom. Remember that everyone in a group conversation can read your inline replies. If you don't want this, start a new conversation with the person you want to reply to. Also, bear in mind that swipe to reply only works on iMessages and not for regular SMS texts.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="4._turn_live_photos_into_live_stickers">4. Turn Live Photos into Live Stickers</h2><br/>
In iOS 17, you can take subjects in your Live Photos and turn them into Live Stickers for use in Messages and elsewhere. As the name suggests, Live Stickers are basically looping animated stickers that you can share with family and friends. <br/>
<ol><br/>
<li>Tap the <strong>+</strong> button to the left of the text input field, then tap the <strong>Stickers</strong> option.</li><br/>
<li>Select the Stickers icon in the row of sticker apps, then tap the big <strong>+</strong> button in the stickers menu.</li><br/>
<li>Next, tap <strong>Live</strong> below the image search bar, then select a Live Photo.<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/2animate-stickers.jpg" alt="stickers" width="4137" height="2716" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-936916" /><br/>
<li>Tap <strong>Add Sticker</strong> at the bottom of the screen, then tap the sticker you just made to select it, ready for sending. Alternatively, press and hold the sticker, then drag it to an earlier part of the conversation.</li><br/>
<li>You can also long press on the sticker to rearrange it in your collection, add an effect, or delete it. Note that if you add an effect to your creation with the <strong>Add Effect</strong> option, it will cease to be a Live Sticker and instead become a standard static sticker.<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/1animate-stickers.jpg" alt="stickers" width="4137" height="2716" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-936917" /></ol><br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="5._use_emoji_as_stickers">5. Use Emoji as Stickers</h2><br/>
In iOS 17, Apple treats all standard emoji as stickers, allowing them to be used in just the same way as actual stickers. What that essentially means is that you aren't limited to inserting them in a conversation. You can also drag them anywhere on a message bubble. You can even layer them on top of one another to create little emoji scenes.<br/>
<ol><li>In a Messages conversation, tap the <strong>Emoji</strong> button in the bottom-left corner of the screen.</li><br/>
<li>Press and hold on an emoji in the list, then drag it up onto the message bubble that you want to react to and release your finger. (Note that you can drag more emoji onto the same message bubble with the same action.)<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/08/2use-emojis-as-stickers-messages.jpg" alt="" width="2860" height="2700" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-907284" /><br/>
<li>To edit emoji stickers on a message bubble, press and hold the emoji, then tap <strong>Sticker Details</strong> in the popup menu.</li><br/>
<li>To delete an emoji sticker, swipe left on it, then tap the <strong>red Trash button</strong> that appears.</li><br/>
<li>Tap <strong>Done</strong> to return to the conversation.<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/08/1use-emojis-as-stickers-messages.jpg" alt="" width="2860" height="2700" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-907283" /></ol><br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="6._manage_sticker_apps">6. Manage Sticker Apps</h2><br/>
Standard sticker packs still feature in iOS 17, but the way you access and manage them has changed since iOS 16. The following steps show you how to access, rearrange, and delete installed sticker apps on your iPhone. <br/>
<ol><li>In a conversation thread, tap the <strong>+</strong> button to the left of the text input field.</li><br/>
<li>Tap <strong>Stickers</strong> in the vertical menu.</li><br/>
<li>Below the text input field, swipe left across the installed sticker apps all the way to the end of the row, then tap the <strong>Edit</strong> button.<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/08/ios-manage-sticker-apps1.jpg" alt="messages" width="4320" height="2700" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-907146" /><br/>
<li>To rearrange the sticker apps as you want them to appear in the previous row, press the three lines beside an app and drag it up or down to your preferred to location.</li><br/>
<li>To delete a sticker app, tap <strong>Edit</strong> in the top left, then tap the <strong>red delete button</strong> next to the app in question.</li><br/>
<li>To finish, tap <strong>Done</strong> in the top right.<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/08/ios-manage-sticker-apps2.jpg" alt="messages" width="4320" height="2700" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-907147" /></ol><br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="7._use_search_filters">7. Use Search Filters</h2><br/>
Previously in iOS 16, you could type a word or phrase in the search field of Apple's Messages app and it would return matching results, but there was no way to filter messages to more easily find what you were looking for. For example, if you were looking for a message from a friend called "John" that had the word "dinner" in it, you would have to search for "dinner" and then scroll through a bunch of messages from anybody and everybody containing that word.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/messages-search-filters.jpg" alt="" width="4137" height="1377" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-936926" /><br/>
Thankfully, in iOS 17, Apple improved the search function so that you can combine search queries and narrow down results to quickly find the messages that you're looking for. If you're looking for an image or link from a certain person, for example, first type in the person's name, then tap "Messages with: [person's name]". <br/>
<br/>
Next, select the "Photo" or "Link" filter that appears, and Messages will narrow down the search results further. You can then enter an additional keyword and Messages will show you any links or pictures containing the word. Alternatively, you can start a search with a keyword and then filter the results by person, link, photo, or location.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="8._save_audio_messages">8. Save Audio Messages</h2><br/>
Another smaller improvement in Messages in iOS 17 is that it's a lot clearer where audio messages are kept when you choose to save them. In iOS 16, pressing and holding an audio message brought up a Save option in the pop-up menu, but after tapping it, it was not obvious where to go to locate the file.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/07/save-to-voice-memos.jpg" alt="" width="1366" height="1388" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-904284" /><br/>
‌iOS 17‌, Apple fixed this issue by replacing the "Save" option with "Save to Voice Memos". After tapping it, all you need to do then is open the Voice Memos app, where you'll find the audio message at the top of the list. From there, you can opt to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/enhance-voice-memo-recordings-ios/">enhance the recording</a>, skip silences, give the memo an identifying name, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/delete-voice-memo-recordings-iphone-ipad/">delete it</a> when you no longer need it.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="9._adjust_audio_message_speed">9. Adjust Audio Message Speed</h2><br/>
When you receive an audio message, you aren't limited to listening to it at the speed it was recorded. If the message includes periodic silences or the person is speaking slowly, you might want to play it back at a faster speed.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/audio-message-playback-speed.jpg" alt="audio message" width="2738" height="1709" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-936922" /><br/>
Simply long press on the play button to reveal a menu of playback speed options, including 1x, 1.25x, 1.5x, and 2x.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="10._send_audio_messages_faster">10. Send Audio Messages Faster</h2><br/>
If you tend to send lots of audio messages in succession, you don't need to keep tapping the + button to reveal the Audio option to record another one.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Earlier this week, Peloton said that it would drop support for Apple's GymKit feature that syncs data to the Health app. Customers were unhappy with the decision and complained to the company, leading Peloton to announce a change in plans.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-757966" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/09/peloton-bike-plus-treadmill-gymkit.jpg" alt="" width="921" height="457" /><br/>
<br/>
Peloton on Thursday said that after listening to member feedback on GymKit, the integration will continue to be offered.<br/>
<br/>
Peloton wanted to stop offering GymKit integration in favor of the Peloton One-Tap tracking feature, but GymKit has been a key feature on the &#36;2,500 Bike+ <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2020/09/08/peloton-announces-bike-gymkit-support/">since its 2020 debut</a>, and other Peloton machines since 2022.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">After listening to Members’ feedback about discontinuing Apple GymKit integration for Bike+, we have decided to continue offering Apple GymKit integration. As a Member-first company, we are always grateful to our Members for sharing their views.</p>&mdash; Peloton (@onepeloton) <a href="https://twitter.com/onepeloton/status/1758588966276870466?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 16, 2024</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div><br/>
The One-Tap tracking app does monitor distance, pace, and heart rate metrics, but only basic information is synced to the Apple Health app. With GymKit, data like cadence, average speed, and average power is also available in the Health app for Peloton users.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/peloton/">Peloton</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/16/peloton-apple-gymkit-support/">Peloton Reverses Course, Will Continue to Support Apple GymKit</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/peloton-reverses-course-will-continue-to-support-apple-gymkit.2419666/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Today marks the two-week anniversary of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a> launch, and the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/14/vision-pro-return-friday/">last day for returns</a> for those who purchased on release day. With plenty of stories going around from those who decided not to keep the &#36;3,500 device, <em>MacRumors</em> videographer Dan Barbera thought he'd share some of the reasons why he'll be keeping his headset.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lnQld2M8P4A" title="Apple Vision Pro Review: Why I am KEEPIN" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe><em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/macrumors?sub_confirmation=1">Subscribe to the MacRumors YouTube channel</a> for more videos.</em></div><br/>
We need to have a few Vision Pro headsets on hand to write about them here at <em>MacRumors</em>, so that's one of the primary reasons that Dan will be keeping his. Apple is already working on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/visionos/">visionOS</a> 2, and we're interested in seeing what changes and updates are in store. We're also getting new apps on a regular basis, all of which make the Vision Pro a more appealing device.<br/>
<br/>
The Vision Pro is the best way to be immersed in a movie, especially 3D movies, and that's another key reason why Dan won't be bringing his back to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-store/">Apple Store</a>. The Cinema Environment that shuts out the world is hard to beat because it's basically your own personal movie theater.<br/>
<br/>
Working on the Vision Pro needs some improvement, perhaps with support for multiple Mac displays, but it's useful when traveling with a laptop. It would also be nice to be able to use a mouse, but Magic Keyboard and Trackpad input work well enough.<br/>
<br/>
There are some downsides to the Vision Pro. It's hard to wear for more than about an hour, the battery life is awful, and it doesn't hold a charge at all when not in use. Touch typing with the air keyboard is a poor experience, Personas need a lot of work to be less creepy, there still aren't a whole lot of groundbreaking app experiences, and Guest Mode is awful, so it is fully understandable why we're hearing a lot of return stories.<br/>
<br/>
Make sure to watch Dan's full video to get his thoughts on the Vision Pro after two weeks, and let us know if you kept or returned your Vision Pro in the comments below.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AppleVisionPro">Vision Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-vision-pro.209">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/16/vision-pro-2-week-review/">Review: Two Weeks With the Apple Vision Pro</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/review-two-weeks-with-the-apple-vision-pro.2419660/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Following our previous in-depth coverage of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a> and the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/06/apple-iphone-16-slim-camera-bump/">various camera bump designs</a> Apple has tested for it, new information has surfaced on social media website X from user Majin Bu. Although this user has a mixed track record, they have occasionally provided accurate information on the design of upcoming iPhones, and their latest post could very well be our first look at a genuine &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; part.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/Screenshot-2024-02-16-at-7.05.28 PM.png" alt="" width="2062" height="1160" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-936878" /><br/>
In <a href="https://twitter.com/MajinBuOfficial/status/1758491579067650512">their post</a>, Bu shared an image of what appears to be the main camera chassis for the base model &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj;, featuring a vertical camera layout. Although the part image was posted upside down, as pointed out by users <a href="https://twitter.com/axoajo/status/1758523318976549339">replying</a> to Bu's post, this does not affect the authenticity of the component itself.<br/>
<br/>
<em>MacRumors</em> is able to independently verify the authenticity of the component design pictured above. Through our industry sources, we are able to confirm that the item featured in Bu’s post is the main camera chassis for the I-34 camera project, intended for use in the base model &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; set to be released later this year. <br/>
<br/>
This latest component leak aligns with <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/22/iphone-16-vertical-camera-lenses-rumor/">multiple reports</a> concerning the new vertical camera layout Apple has planned for the &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj;. As seen in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/12/early-iphone-16-prototypes/">our December report on early iPhone 16 prototypes</a>, along with our coverage of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/06/apple-iphone-16-slim-camera-bump/">more recent internal designs</a>, Apple has decided to align the cameras vertically, as opposed to the current diagonal layout found on the base model <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a> and &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; Plus. By employing a vertical camera layout, Apple could bring Spatial Video recording to the base model &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj;, expanding the feature's overall availability to the entire &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; range.<br/>
<br/>
Along with the vertical camera layout, the &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; is also expected to receive the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/30/iphone-16-action-button-all-models/">Action button</a> as a carryover from the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a>, and will have an additional <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/25/iphone-16-capture-button/">Capture button</a> featuring force-sensor technology, located on the right side of the device.<br/>

<br/>

In its <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/news/epic-games-store-2023-year-in-review">2023 Year in Review</a>, Epic said that it received its Apple Developer Account and would soon start developing an alternative app marketplace. The &zwnj;Epic Games&zwnj; Store will launch on iOS in the EU at some point in 2024, and it will provide a way for &zwnj;Epic Games&zwnj; to bring a Fortnite app to iOS once again.<br/>

Fortnite was removed from the iOS <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a> at <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2020/08/13/apple-removes-fortnite-from-app-store/">the start of the Epic Games v. Apple feud</a> in 2020, and it has been unavailable since then. &zwnj;Epic Games&zwnj; did bring it to iPhones and iPads <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/05/05/fortnite-xbox-cloud-gaming/">through Xbox Cloud Gaming</a> and GeForce NOW, but the game has only been accessible through these browser-based services.<br/>
<br/>
Shortly after Apple's alternative app marketplace plan was announced, &zwnj;Epic Games&zwnj; promised that Fortnite would "return to iOS" in Europe, and at the same time, &zwnj;Epic Games&zwnj; CEO Tim Sweeney lambasted Apple's plan to comply with the DMA. He called it a "devious new instance of Malicious Compliance" and said that the company "strongly reject[s] Apple's twisting this process to undermine competition and continue imposing Apple taxes on transactions they're not involved in."<br/>
<br/>
While working to implement the &zwnj;Epic Games&zwnj; Store on iOS, Epic also plans to continue to "argue to the courts and regulators that Apple is breaking the law."<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/16/epic-games-store-ios-eu/">Epic Games Plans for Alternative App Marketplace in EU as Apple Reinstates Developer Account</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/epic-games-plans-for-alternative-app-marketplace-in-eu-as-apple-reinstates-developer-account.2419640/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[iOS 18 and iPadOS 18 will include a "slew of new AI features," according to a report this week <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-02-15/apple-s-ai-plans-github-copilot-rival-for-developers-tool-for-testing-apps">from <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/iOS-18-Mock-iPhone-16-Feature-Gray.jpg" alt="" width="2250" height="1266" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-936483" /><br/>
The report claims that Apple is training both Siri and the iPhone's built-in Spotlight search tool on large language models, with a goal of improving each feature's ability to answer more complex questions accurately. The revamped version of Spotlight could also offer deeper integration with "specific" functions and features in apps.<br/>
<br/>
Apple has also explored AI-powered features that would allow users to automatically generate playlists in Apple Music and presentation slides in the Keynote app, the report said. Other apps that are rumored to gain deeper AI integration in iOS 18 include Health, Messages, Numbers, Pages, and Shortcuts, and there will likely be more.<br/>
<br/>
On an earnings call this month, Apple CEO Tim Cook said the company was working on generative AI and would <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/01/apple-ai-details-coming-later-this-year/">share details "later this year."</a> Apple is expected to announce iOS 18 at its annual developers conference WWDC in June, and the update should be released in September. Some new AI features announced later could be exclusive to iPhone 16 models, which are rumored to get a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/14/iphone-16-upgraded-neural-engine-rumor/">"significantly" upgraded Neural Engine</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Beyond iOS 18 and iPadOS 18, Gurman said Apple is planning to add some new AI features to macOS 15, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/15/apple-xcode-ai-tool-for-coding/">to its app development tool Xcode</a>.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/16/ios-18-slew-of-new-ai-features/">iOS 18 Rumored to Include &#039;Slew of New AI Features&#039; for Siri and More</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-18-rumored-to-include-slew-of-new-ai-features-for-siri-and-more.2419635/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Newly established luxury airline Beond has announced it will offer <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a> headsets to select passengers for "an immersive inflight entertainment experience."<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/beond-airline.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-936752" /><br/>
The premium leisure airline said it will provide the Apple devices to passengers on its flights to the Maldives, where the airline is based. From the <a href="https://flybeond.com/latestnews">press release</a>:<br/>
<blockquote>Beond's Chairman and CEO, Tero Taskila, said: "The Apple Vision Pro will transform the inflight entertainment experience, and we will be first to offer it to select passengers. In addition to our existing and ever-growing library of inflight content such as movies and games, Beond will showcase stunning resort destinations and activities in the Maldives. We are working now with partners in the Maldives to prepare truly amazing footage. The inflight experience will build anticipation for passengers before they arrive in the Maldives. Offering the Apple Vision Pro is another step in our vision of delivering a premium travel experience to our customers, from the start to finish of their journey. We're proud to be the first airline to deploy the technology."</blockquote>The overall response to &zwnj;Apple Vision Pro&zwnj; from users, critics, and the broader public has been varied. However, the consensus is that wearing the headset during flights stands out as one of its most widely appreciated applications.<br/>
<br/>
Acknowledging the headset's potential to make long-haul flights more private and liberating, Apple has included a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/16/apple-vision-pro-guest-user-and-travel-modes/">Travel mode</a> in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/visionos/">visionOS</a> that stabilizes visuals for users on an airplane, allowing them to, for example, watch movies on a massive virtual screen.<br/>

Beond said it will offer "Apple's ground-breaking content experience" beginning in July 2024. The news follows Beond's launch of commercial passenger services in 2023 from Munich, Zurich, and Riyadh to Malé, Maldives. Beond says it plans to debut flights from Milan, Dubai, and Bangkok to the Maldives in mid-2024, in an all-lay flat seating configuration. <div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AppleVisionPro">Vision Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-vision-pro.209">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/16/premium-leisure-airline-apple-vision-pro/">Premium Airline Beond to Offer Passengers Apple Vision Pro Headsets</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/premium-airline-beond-to-offer-passengers-apple-vision-pro-headsets.2419609/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple has suspended its development of a foldable iPhone after supplier displays failed to pass the company's own stringent testing standards, claims a new rumor coming out of China.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/11/foldable-iphone.jpg" alt="" width="1995" height="1057" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-872750" /><br/>
According to <a href="https://weibo.com/5821279480/O0Gc56ZPu">Fixed Focus Digital</a>, a Weibo-based tech video blogger from Guangdong with a huge Chinese following, Apple has been testing rival foldable phones as part of its research and development process into foldable devices, which is believed to have been going on since <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2016/12/16/lg-foldable-displays-iphone/">2016</a>. <br/>
<br/>
At least one of the foldables that Apple is said to have been testing uses a display made by Samsung. Samsung is a major supplier of display panels used in Apple devices, and is known to have <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2020/09/10/apple-orders-samsung-foldable-display-samples/">provided foldable display samples to Apple</a> in the past. A recent report also claimed that Samsung has been attempting to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/11/apple-foldable-panels-samsung-display/">strengthen its operational efficiency</a> in anticipation of Apple's first foldable products by integrating the expertise it has gained making foldable devices since 2019. <br/>
<br/>
However, the source of today's rumor claims that Samsung's latest folding panels "broke down after a few days" under Apple's rigorous internal testing, which has caused Apple to put the entire project on ice for the foreseeable future, or at least until a display that can meet its high standards can be developed.<br/>
<br/>
According to a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/07/apple-continuing-work-on-folding-iphones/">report</a> from <em>The Information</em> earlier this month, Apple has been actively building prototypes of at least two foldable iPhones following over five years of research and development. The two iPhone prototypes are said to fold widthwise like a clamshell, but do not feature in Apple's product roadmap for 2024 or 2025. The report noted that the foldable iPhones could still be canceled if they do not meet Apple's standards.<br/>
<br/>
The Weibo account purporting to have received information about the foldable project's suspension at Apple is a largely unknown quantity, having no previous track record for Apple rumors to our knowledge, therefore skepticism about its accuracy is warranted. <br/>
<br/>
It's also unclear whether the claim impacts Apple's continuing work on a foldable iPad. Apple is rumored to be more interested in such a device, which could be thicker than a foldable ‌iPhone‌ since users would not expect to carry it in their pocket and it would not need to pass the high durability requirements of an ‌iPhone‌. <br/>
<br/>
Earlier this month, Korean outlet <em>The Elec</em> <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/02/apple-foldable-2026-could-replace-ipad-mini/">reported</a> that Apple is considering launching its first foldable in the next few years in the form of a 7- to 8-inch device that could ultimately replace the 8.3-inch iPad mini.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/foldable-iphone/">Foldable iPhone</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/foldable-ipad/">Foldable iPad</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/fixed-focus-digital/">Fixed Focus Digital</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/16/foldable-iphone-paused-failing-screens/">Foldable iPhone Development Allegedly Paused Due to Failing Screens</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/foldable-iphone-development-allegedly-paused-due-to-failing-screens.2419605/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<title>Apple Negotiating With OLED Suppliers for Next Year&#039;s iPhone SE 4</title>

		<description><![CDATA[Several of Apple's display suppliers have proposed their prices for supplying OLED displays for the fourth-generation iPhone SE, <em><a href="https://www.thelec.net/news/articleView.html?idxno=4724">The Elec</a></em> reports.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/02/iphone-se-4-modified-flag-edges.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-886982" /><br/>
Samsung Display, BOE, and Tianma are all said to have entered their proposed prices for OLED panels for the iPhone SE 4, which is expected to launch next year. Previous iPhone SE models have all used LCD displays.<br/>
<br/>
The report's sources said Samsung offered the lowest unit price of &#36;30, BOE offered &#36;35, and Tianma &#36;40. Apple is reportedly haggling for &#36;20, and negotiations are ongoing. Display manufacturers are believed to have been bidding to supply the panels since at least <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/11/suppliers-bidding-on-iphone-se-4-displays/">last August</a>. <br/>
<br/>
The panel prices are said to be a lot lower than suppliers charge for the OLED displays used in the iPhone 15, because the panels for the SE will use legacy parts identical to those used in the iPhone 13 and iPhone 14, so the suppliers won't need to make new investments in R&D.<br/>
<br/>
In that respect, Samsung is said to have an advantage over its rivals since the Korean company can use its existing iPhone 14 OLED inventory.<br/>
<br/>
According to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/">Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo</a>, the fourth-generation ‌iPhone SE‌ will feature a 6.1-inch OLED display with a design similar to the iPhone 14. The ‌iPhone SE‌ 4 is also expected to use the exact same battery found in the base model iPhone 14.<br/>
<br/>
In addition, the new model is likely to be equipped with an Action button and USB-C port, which we've covered extensively in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/27/iphone-se-4-details/">previous reports</a>. As things stand, it could be one of the first devices to feature an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/12/iphone-se-5g-modem-2025-launch-rumor/">Apple-designed modem chip</a>, too.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-se/">iPhone SE</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone_SE">iPhone SE (Caution)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99">iPhone</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/16/apple-iphone-se-4-oled-panel-orders/">Apple Negotiating With OLED Suppliers for Next Year&#039;s iPhone SE 4</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-negotiating-with-oled-suppliers-for-next-years-iphone-se-4.2419597/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Microsoft does not plan to bring an Xbox Cloud Gaming app to iOS at this time because there's no opportunity for monetization, Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer said in an interview with <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24073666/microsoft-gaming-phil-spencer-interview-ps5-switch-games">The Verge</a></em>. When asked whether Apple's recent app ecosystem changes in the European Union make "room" for Xbox Cloud Gaming on iOS, Spencer said that monetization was an issue, and that the Digital Markets Act forcing Apple's updates does not "go far enough to open up competition."<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-758525" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/09/App-Store-and-XCloud.jpg" alt="" width="2250" height="1266" /><br/>
<blockquote>There's not room for us to monetize Xbox Cloud Gaming on iOS. I think the proposal that Apple put forward -- and I thought Sarah Bond's comments on this were right on -- doesn't go far enough to open up. In fact, you might even say they go the opposite direction in some way, but they definitely don't go far enough to open up competition on the world's largest gaming platform.<br/>
<br/>
We will continue to work with regulators, and Apple and Google, to create a space for alternative storefronts. I'm a big fan of how Windows works, and you've got a Microsoft Store on Windows, you've got Steam, you've got the Epic Games Store, you've got GOG. You have alternatives, and I think alternative ways for people to buy things creates goodness for consumers and creators. I think the largest platform for gamers, which is mobile, should have the same.</blockquote><br/>
Spencer said that earlier comments <a href="https://twitter.com/BondSarah_Bond/status/1752083596318593238">from Xbox President Sarah Bond</a> were "right on." Back in January, Bond said that Apple's policy is a "step in the wrong direction." According to Spencer, Microsoft plans to continue to work with regulators to "create a space for alternative storefronts."<br/>
<br/>
In the European Union, the Digital Markets Act requires Apple to allow for alternative app marketplaces and alternative payment methods, but Apple is requiring developers who opt to use an alternative app marketplace to agree to new business terms that include a Core Development Fee of .50 euros per user. Companies like <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/26/spotify-on-apple-eu-app-changes/">Spotify</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/25/fortnite-returning-to-ios-in-europe/">Epic Games</a> have criticized Apple's implementation of the DMA's requirements. Spotify CEO Daniel Ek said that Apple's plan is a "complete and total farce," while <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/epic-games/">Epic Games</a> CEO Tim Sweeney said Apple's implementation is a "devious new instance of malicious compliance."<br/>

Alongside the changes in the European Union under the DMA, Apple also changed its <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a> policies around cloud gaming apps. Apple now allows streaming game apps on the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; worldwide, with the apps able to offer a selection of games from within a single app. Previously, cloud gaming services were only available via a web interface.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/15/xbox-cloud-gaming-ios-microsoft/">Microsoft Not Planning on Xbox Cloud Gaming App for iOS Because There&#039;s &#039;Not Room&#039; for Monetization</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/microsoft-not-planning-on-xbox-cloud-gaming-app-for-ios-because-theres-not-room-for-monetization.2419572/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today stopped signing iOS 17.3, preventing <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> users from downgrading to that version of iOS. iOS 17.3 is no longer being signed following the February 8 <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/08/apple-releases-ios-17-3-1-with-fix-for-text-bug/">release of iOS 17.3.1</a>, an update that added a fix for a text-related bug.<br/>

Apple routinely stops signing older versions of iOS, so it is not unusual that the iOS 17.3 update is no longer available. Apple prevents users from installing older versions of iOS to encourage customers to keep their operating systems up to date and to prevent downgrading to older, less secure versions of the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; operating system.<br/>
<br/>
iOS 17.3.1 is now the only publicly released version of iOS available, but Apple is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ios-17-4-beta-features/">also beta testing iOS 17.4</a>. Both developers and public beta testers can download and install iOS 17.4, with the update adding a number of App Store-related changes in the EU, new emoji, transcripts in the Podcasts app, and more.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/15/apple-stops-signing-ios-17-3/">Apple Stops Signing iOS 17.3, Downgrading No Longer Available</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-stops-signing-ios-17-3-downgrading-no-longer-available.2419569/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple is working on an updated version of Xcode that will include an AI tool for generating code, reports <em><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-02-15/apple-s-ai-plans-github-copilot-rival-for-developers-tool-for-testing-apps">Bloomberg</a></em>. The AI tool will be similar to GitHub Copilot from Microsoft, which can generate code based on natural language requests and convert code from one programming language to another.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/04/apple-developer-app-feature.jpg" alt="" width="2250" height="1266" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-795934" /><br/>
The Xcode AI tool will be able to predict and finish blocks of code, allowing developers to streamline their app creation process. Apple is now testing the functionality internally and plans to release it to third-party software developers "as early as this year."<br/>
<br/>
Apple is also testing AI-generated code for testing apps, and has asked some engineers to try these features out internally.<br/>
<br/>
The artificial intelligence capabilities added to Xcode will join several other AI features that Apple plans to add to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a> and other built-in apps. Some new features could include the option to generate playlists in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/">Apple Music</a> and create slideshows in Keynote, with Apple also working on improved Spotlight search capabilities. Search could encompass specific features in apps and might also provide responses to complex questions, with the feature built using large language models.<br/>
<br/>
According to <em>Bloomberg</em>, Apple software chief Craig Federighi has asked employees to create as many new AI features as possible for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a>, iPadOS 18, and macOS 15. Apple plans to introduce "a slew of new AI features," and &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj; will be marketed as one of the biggest updates to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> since it launched. Some of the AI features will come to macOS, but Apple plans to "take a gradual approach to AI development" with some features not coming "for years."<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/bloomberg-com/">Bloomberg</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/machine-learning/">Machine Learning</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/artificial-intelligence/">Artificial Intelligence</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-gpt/">Apple GPT</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/15/apple-xcode-ai-tool-for-coding/">Apple Developing AI Tool to Help Developers Write Code for Apps</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-developing-ai-tool-to-help-developers-write-code-for-apps.2419561/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>
