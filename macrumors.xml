		<description><![CDATA[With the new Passwords app in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a>, iPadOS 18, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sequoia/">macOS Sequoia</a>, there's a feature that is designed to allow websites and apps to upgrade existing accounts to passkeys automatically.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/ios-18-passkey-upgrade.jpg" alt="" width="1896" height="1067" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-954844" /><br/>
Enabled by default, the feature will speed up the adoption of passkeys, which are more secure than a traditional login and password. Passkeys log you in with <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mask-face-id/">Face ID</a> or <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/touch-id/">Touch ID</a> rather than a password, and because on-device authentication is required, passkeys put a stop to online attacks like phishing. There's no password to steal or authentication code that can be intercepted.<br/>
<br/>
Several popular websites and services have implemented Passkey support since Apple started using passkeys in 2022, including Twitter, Google, WhatsApp, TikTok, PayPal, Best Buy, Microsoft, PlayStation, and eBay.<br/>
<br/>
Passkeys are supported in the new Passwords app that's available in &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj;, iPadOS 18, &zwnj;macOS Sequoia&zwnj;, and Windows PCs through <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/icloud/">iCloud</a> for Windows. <br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today shared a few WWDC 2024 <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2024/10112/">coding</a> <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2024/10111">sessions</a> related to its upcoming next-generation CarPlay system ahead of its launch later this year.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/Next-Gen-CarPlay-WWDC24-1.jpg" alt="" width="3840" height="2160" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-954798" /><br/>
The sessions include lots of updated next-generation CarPlay images, with one revealing new Vehicle, Media, and Climate apps in action for the first time. <em>MacRumors</em> previously discovered <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/25/ios-17-4-next-generation-carplay/">evidence of these apps in the iOS 17.4 beta</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Next-generation CarPlay will be highly customizable, allowing automakers to tailor the design of the system to uniquely match their vehicles. Apple revealed a variety of different design options and layouts that will be possible, as shown below.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/Next-Generation-CarPlay-Design-WWDC-2024-2.jpeg" alt="" width="3840" height="2160" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-954801" /><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/Next-Generation-CarPlay-Design-WWDC-2024-3.jpeg" alt="" width="3840" height="2160" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-954802" /><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/Next-Generation-CarPlay-Design-WWDC-2024-4.jpeg" alt="" width="3840" height="2160" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-954803" /><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/Next-Generation-CarPlay-Design-WWDC-2024-5.jpeg" alt="" width="3840" height="2160" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-954804" /><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/Next-Generation-CarPlay-Design-WWDC-2024-6.jpeg" alt="" width="3840" height="2160" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-954805" /><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/Next-Generation-CarPlay-Design-WWDC-2024-7.jpeg" alt="" width="3840" height="2160" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-954806" /><br/>
Other images provide a closer look at the Vehicle and Climate apps, which will house vehicle settings and climate controls, respectively.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/Next-Generation-CarPlay-Vehicle-Settings.jpg" alt="" width="1579" height="784" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-954824" /><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/Next-Generation-CarPlay-WWDC-2024-Climate-Controls.jpg" alt="" width="2410" height="1201" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-954822" /><br/>
Next-generation CarPlay will allow automakers to show custom alerts related to an electric vehicle's charging status, an available software update for the vehicle, and more. In addition, it will feature rear-camera integration, as shown below. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/Next-Generation-CarPlay-WWDC-2024-Charging.jpg" alt="" width="1576" height="777" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-954826" /><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/Next-Generation-CarPlay-Vehicle-Software-Update.jpg" alt="" width="1574" height="782" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-954816" /><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/Next-Generation-CarPlay-Rear-Camera.jpg" alt="" width="1574" height="788" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-954815" /><br/>
<a href="https://www.apple.com/ios/carplay/">Apple's website</a> continues to say that the first vehicles with next-generation CarPlay will arrive in 2024, but it has yet to provide a more specific timeframe, and it did not provide any timing-related updates in the WWDC coding sessions. Aston Martin and Porsche <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/20/first-next-generation-carplay-vehicles-announced/">previewed next-generation CarPlay vehicle designs</a> late last year.<br/>

		<title>iOS 18 Apple Intelligence Feature Will Have Waitlist During Initial &#039;Limited Preview&#039;</title>

		<description><![CDATA[The Apple Intelligence features that will be introduced later during the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a> beta testing process will have a waitlist at first, according to code in &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj; found by <em>MacRumors</em> contributor Aaron Perris.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/Apple-WWDC24-Apple-Intelligence-hero-240610.jpg" alt="" width="1960" height="1102" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-954530" /><br/>
In &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj;, Apple Intelligence is codenamed Graymatter. There are references to a waitlist, with specific strings that say "Join the Graymatter Waiting List" and "Joined Waitlist." There is also wording that refers to it as a "limited preview."<br/>
<blockquote>"While Graymatter is in limited preview, you may experience unusually slow responses when not in a supported region."</blockquote><br/>
Apple plans to introduce Apple Intelligence during the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/10/apple-intelligence-ios-18-beta/">iOS 18 beta testing period</a> this summer, so the limited preview and waitlist may be something that Apple will use during the beta testing period.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/homekit/">HomeKit</a> and the Home app weren't focused on much during Apple's WWDC keynote, but there are several new features that are coming in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a>, iPadOS 18, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sequoia/">macOS Sequoia</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/home-app-ios-18-features.jpg" alt="" width="2926" height="1646" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-954758" /><br/>
With Customize Access, you can manage how and when people can access your &zwnj;HomeKit&zwnj; devices like garage openers, alarm systems, and door locks. You can create guest schedules and specific accessories that your guests can use, limiting times that your home is accessible. A home hub is required for this feature.<br/>
<br/>
You can enable Express Mode for unlocking door locks automatically as you approach with an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> or an Apple Watch, so you don't need to tap your device to the lock to get it to open. You'll need an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; or Apple Watch with an Ultra Wideband chip for this to work, along with an Ultra Wideband lock.<br/>
<br/>
Later this year, Apple plans to add support for robot vacuum cleaners. The Home app will support the core functionality of robot vacuums, like power control, cleaning mode, vacuum, mop, and charge status. The vacuums can also be used in automations and scenes, and respond to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a> requests.<br/>
<br/>
Apple is adding electricity usage integration into the Home app, but it's only available to select Pacific Gas and Electric Company customers in the United States to begin. With this feature, users can see their home electricity usage from the Home app, along with rate plan.<br/>
<br/>
Electricity usage integration is coming later in 2024, and Apple also plans to add other providers in the future.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/10/ios-18-homekit-features/">HomeKit in iOS 18 Includes Guest Access, Hands-Free Unlock, Electricity Usage Integration and More</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/homekit-in-ios-18-includes-guest-access-hands-free-unlock-electricity-usage-integration-and-more.2428763/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple and Canon today <a href="https://global.canon/en/news/2024/20240611.html">announced</a> the development of a new mirrorless camera lens designed to capture spatial video for the Vision Pro headset. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/canon-spatial-lens.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="840" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-954752" /><br/>
Canon's RF-S7.8mm F4 STM DUAL lens is specifically intended to capture spatial video content, tailored for use with Apple's Vision Pro headset. The new lens is designed for the Canon EOS R7 camera and features dual optics, mimicking the human field of view.<br/>
<br/>
The RF-S7.8mm F4 STM DUAL lens features a high-speed autofocus mechanism, ensuring that even in challenging lighting conditions, videographers can capture clear spatial video. After recording, the footage can be processed using Canon's EOS VR Utility app, which transforms the video into spatial content optimized for the Vision Pro.<br/>
<br/>
The announcement marks a significant step in the effort to create more content for the Vision Pro. The RF-S7.8mm F4 STM DUAL lens is set to be available later this fall, with pricing details yet to be announced.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/canon/">Canon</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AppleVisionPro">Vision Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-vision-pro.209">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/10/canon-lens-for-spatial-video/">Apple and Canon Announce Mirrorless Camera Lens Designed for Spatial Video Capture</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-and-canon-announce-mirrorless-camera-lens-designed-for-spatial-video-capture.2428759/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Elon Musk has threatened to ban Apple devices from his companies over Apple’s newly announced <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/10/siri-can-access-chatgpt-with-ios-18/">ChatGPT integration</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/04/elon-musk.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-842835" /><br/>
Apple Intelligence in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a>, iPadOS 18, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sequoia/">macOS Sequoia</a> allows <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a> to utilize ChatGPT to handle complex queries, but only when explicit user permission is provided. The feature is designed to provide users with richer, more contextual responses without requiring them to open the ChatGPT app.<br/>
<br/>
During Apple's keynote event, Senior Vice President of Software Engineering, Craig Federighi, emphasized that users will have full control over when ChatGPT is used and that data shared with OpenAI would not be logged or stored. "You are in control over when ChatGPT is used and will be asked before any of your information is shared," Federighi said.<br/>
<br/>
Despite these assurances, <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk">Musk expressed</a> strong opposition to the integration on his social media platform, X (formerly Twitter). Musk said, "If Apple integrates OpenAI at the OS level, then Apple devices will be banned at my companies. That is an unacceptable security violation." He continued, "Visitors will have to check their Apple devices at the door, where they will be stored in a Faraday cage." He also repeatedly questioned Apple's ability to ensure data security, stating, "Apple has no clue what's actually going on once they hand your data over to OpenAI. They're selling you down the river."<br/>
<br/>
Apple and OpenAI have both emphasized that user data will only be shared with explicit consent and that these interactions are designed to be secure. OpenAI noted in a new <a href="https://openai.com/index/openai-and-apple-announce-partnership/">blog post</a> that "requests are not stored by OpenAI, and users' IP addresses are obscured." Users can also choose to connect their ChatGPT accounts to access paid features, but this is an opt-in feature.<br/>
<br/>
Apple has been clear in its messaging that the new AI capabilities are designed with user privacy at the core. Apple's approach leverages a combination of on-device processing and cloud computing, ensuring that data is not stored in the cloud. Apple's integration of ChatGPT into its operating systems is part of a broader strategy to enhance the AI capabilities of iOS, iPadOS, and macOS. <div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/elon-musk/">Elon Musk</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/10/elon-musk-threatens-to-ban-apple-devices/">Elon Musk Threatens to Ban Apple Devices Over ChatGPT Integration</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/elon-musk-threatens-to-ban-apple-devices-over-chatgpt-integration.2428757/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[With <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a>, iPadOS 18, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sequoia/">macOS Sequoia</a>, Apple has replaced the Private Wi-Fi Address option for Wi-Fi networks with a new Rotate Wi-Fi Address option that's aimed at better minimizing tracking.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/rotate-wifi-address-ios-18.jpg" alt="" width="2553" height="1436" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-954724" /><br/>
Available when accessing the settings of any Wi-Fi network, Apple says the opt-in Rotate Wi-Fi Address feature changes your Wi-Fi address at random times.<br/>
<blockquote>A rotating Wi-Fi address helps reduce tracking by changing your Wi-Fi address at various times. Tracking can happen when your address always appears the same to other devices and people using the same network as you.</blockquote><br/>
The prior Private Wi-Fi Address setting assigned a different MAC address to a device for each Wi-Fi network it connected to.<br/>
<br/>
Rotate Wi-Fi Address, like Private Wi-Fi Address, is separate from the additional Limit IP Address Tracking option that can be turned on for Mail and Safari.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sequoia/">macOS Sequoia</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/10/ios-18-rotate-wifi-address/">iOS 18 and macOS Sequoia Add &#039;Rotate Wi-Fi Address&#039; Option to Cut Down on Tracking</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-18-and-macos-sequoia-add-rotate-wi-fi-address-option-to-cut-down-on-tracking.2428755/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[macOS Sequoia is still compatible with several Intel-based Macs, but it does drop support for 2018 and 2019 models of the MacBook Air.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/sequoia.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-954485" /><br/>
macOS Sequoia is compatible with the following Macs, according to Apple:<br/>
<br/>
<ul><li><strong>MacBook Pro:</strong> 2018 and later</li><br/>
<li><strong>MacBook Air:</strong> 2020 and later</li><br/>
<li><strong>Mac mini:</strong> 2018 and later</li><br/>
<li><strong>iMac:</strong> 2019 and later</li><br/>
<li><strong>iMac Pro:</strong> 2017</li><br/>
<li><strong>Mac Studio:</strong> 2022 and later</li><br/>
<li><strong>Mac Pro:</strong> 2019 and later</li></ul><br/>
<br/>
The upcoming <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/10/apple-intelligence-generative-personal-ai-unveiled-for-iphone-ipad-and-mac/">"Apple Intelligence" suite of AI features</a> will require an Apple silicon Mac with an M1 chip or newer. The new AI features can help you write faster, categorize mail, prioritize notifications, and more. A smarter version of Siri powered by Apple Intelligence will also be limited to Macs with an M1 chip or newer.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/10/apple-announces-macos-sequoia/">iPhone Mirroring</a> will be available on both Apple silicon Macs and Intel-based Macs with the T2 security chip, letting you control your iPhone from your Mac's screen:<blockquote>A user's custom wallpaper and icons appear just like on their iPhone, and they can swipe between pages on their Home Screen, or launch and browse any of their favorite apps. The keyboard, trackpad, and mouse on Mac also let a user interact with their iPhone, and audio even comes through. Users can seamlessly drag and drop between iPhone and Mac, and a user's iPhone remains locked, so nobody else can access or see what the user is doing. It also works great with StandBy, which stays visible, so users can get information at a glance. Additionally, users can review and respond to iPhone notifications directly from their Mac.</blockquote>As for iPadOS 18, the update drops support for the first-generation 10.5-inch iPad Pro, second-generation 12.9-inch iPad Pro, and the sixth-generation low-end iPad.<br/>
<br/>
iPadOS 18 is compatible with the following iPads, according to Apple:<br/>
<br/>
<ul><li>iPad Pro: 2018 and later</li><br/>
<li>iPad Air: 2019 and later</li><br/>
<li>iPad mini: 2019 and later</li><br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple is improving privacy in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a>, introducing a feature that allows apps to be locked or hidden, which makes them inaccessible without a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mask-face-id/">Face ID</a> scan.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/ios-18-lock-apps.jpg" alt="" width="5560" height="3128" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-954703" /><br/>
If someone is using your phone and you've locked an app, when they try to open that app, they'll see a popup that says it can't be accessed without secondary authentication. Locking an app can be done by long pressing on it and selecting the Require &zwnj;Face ID&zwnj; option (or <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/touch-id/">Touch ID</a> on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-se/">iPhone SE</a>).<br/>
<br/>
Not all apps can be locked, with Apple not providing an option for innocuous apps like Maps, Clock, Calculator, and Stocks, but almost every other app can be locked, including third-party apps. When you lock an app, you have the option to hide it as well, which moves it into a locked, hidden apps folder that requires authentication to open.<br/>
<br/>
Locked or hidden apps are not only unable to be opened, but also hidden from search, notifications, and other places across the operating system. Enabling a lock on an app also shows the apps that have access to it, such as apps that are able to write images to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/photos/">Photos</a> app. Hiding an app means that you will not receive incoming notifications or calls from it, and it will only be available from a "Hidden" folder in the App Library.<br/>
<br/>
If you want to turn off the locking feature, you can long press on an app icon and choose the "Don't Require &zwnj;Face ID&zwnj;" option. Turning the lock on and off requires a &zwnj;Face ID&zwnj; scan, so it can't be turned off without your knowledge. Locking and hiding apps is also a feature that works on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>. <div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/10/ios-18-hide-lock-apps/">iOS 18 Lets You Lock and Hide Your Apps for Added Privacy</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-18-lets-you-lock-and-hide-your-apps-for-added-privacy.2428745/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[One of the interesting new features coming in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a> will let you automatically record and transcribe your live phone calls through the Phone app. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/Generic-iOS-18-Phone-App-Icon-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-954687" /><br/>
After answering a call or placing a call, you can enable recording. All call participants are notified that the call is being recorded, so there are no surprises and everyone is aware of the recording from the start. As the call is recorded, the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> is also able to provide a transcript. <br/>
<br/>
The upcoming Apple Intelligence features can generate a summary of key points that were included in the call, so you can look back at what was important at a glance. <br/>
<br/>
Phone call transcription will be available in English (U.S., UK, Australia, Canada, India, Ireland, New Zealand, Singapore), Spanish (U.S., Mexico, Spain), French (France), German (Germany), Japanese (Japan), Mandarin Chinese (China mainland, Taiwan), Cantonese (China mainland, Hong Kong), and Portuguese (Brazil).<br/>
<br/>
Other new features for the Phone app include a search interface for call history, autofill for a number when you start typing in digits, and the option to seamlessly switch SIM cards. <br/>
<br/>
Apple also plans to bring the same audio and transcription features to the Notes app, so you can record audio and get a live transcript on the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 12 and later. <div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/10/ios-18-record-phone-calls/">iOS 18 Can Record and Transcribe Your Phone Calls</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-18-can-record-and-transcribe-your-phone-calls.2428741/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a> introduces a host of new features for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>’s Journal app, including an all-new insights view, advanced search and sort functionalities, and integration with the Health app.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/ios-18-journal-app.jpg" alt="" width="4800" height="2700" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-954669" /><br/>
The all-new insights view offers a comprehensive overview of journaling activities. This includes tracking writing streaks, displaying a calendar with existing entries, and providing fun statistics that encourage users to write more frequently. <br/>
<br/>
The updated Journal app now includes advanced search and sort functionalities. Users can easily locate specific entries and organize their journal for easier accessibility. <br/>
<br/>
Time spent journaling can now be recorded as mindful minutes and users can log their state of mind directly within the Journal app.<br/>
<br/>
Apple has introduced new widgets for the Journal app, available on both the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/home-screen/">Home Screen</a> and Lock Screen. These widgets allow users to quickly start a new entry, view their current streaks, and receive writing prompts throughout the day. <br/>
<br/>
The Journal app also gains automatic transcription for audio recordings, allowing users to capture their thoughts and ideas verbally, with the app converting spoken words into text entries. <br/>
<br/>
The app now supports exporting of journal entries, allowing users to save entries offline or share them in printed form.<br/>
<br/>
The Journal app made its debut on the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; in December 2023, but it remains unavailable in iPadOS 18 and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sequoia/">macOS Sequoia</a>.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/10/ios-18-brings-new-insights-to-journal-app/">iOS 18 Brings New Insights, Widgets, and Health Integration to Apple&#039;s Journal App</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-18-brings-new-insights-widgets-and-health-integration-to-apples-journal-app.2428736/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[All four iPhone 15 models feature a setting that <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/19/iphone-15-80-percent-battery-limit-option/">prevents the devices from charging beyond 80%</a> while toggled on, which can potentially improve an iPhone battery's lifespan by reducing the time that the battery is fully charged. And with iOS 18, Apple has taken this feature a step further by adding new 85%, 90%, and 95% charging limit options.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/iOS-18-Custom-Emoji-Tapback-Feature-2-1.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-954637" /><em>Screenshot: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/author/aaron-perris/">Aaron Perris</a></em></div><br/>
The feature can be found in the Settings app under Battery → Charging.<br/>
<br/>
The charging limit feature remains exclusive to the iPhone 15 lineup on the first iOS 18 beta, with the option not found on the iPhone 14 Pro or older.<br/>
<br/>
The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/10/apple-first-developer-betas-new-software/">first iOS 18 beta</a> is now available for Apple Developer Program members, and a public beta will follow in July.

		<description><![CDATA[<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a> allows users to change the two shortcut buttons on the Lock Screen to an action of their choice for the first time.<br/>

Users can now swap out the two controls at the bottom of the Lock Screen for a different action of their choosing. Shortcuts to functions like Translate, Notes, and music recognition in Shazam, and more are available. The full list of actions is as follows:<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Here are all the options to replace the camera and flashlight buttons on the Lock Screen on iOS 18 <a href="https://t.co/ZS6j5xWQzF">pic.twitter.com/ZS6j5xWQzF</a></p>&mdash; Aaron (@aaronp613) <a href="https://twitter.com/aaronp613/status/1800257722673181161?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 10, 2024</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div><br/>

		<description><![CDATA[With <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a>, Apple is expanding the Emergency SOS via satellite feature to introduce Messages via satellite, a feature that will let you send texts even when you don't have a Wi-Fi or cellular connection.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/messages-via-satellite.jpg" alt="" width="2226" height="1252" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-954617" /><br/>
Available on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-14/">iPhone 14</a> or later, you can send and receive iMessages or SMS messages using a satellite connection. The feature works with all iMessage features such as emoji and Tapbacks, plus with iMessage, conversations are end-to-end encrypted.<br/>
<br/>
Messages via satellite will work on the &zwnj;iPhone 14&zwnj; and later, aka the same devices that support Emergency SOS via satellite. Apple did not specify whether there will be a cost for Messages via satellite, but Emergency SOS via satellite is still free for all &zwnj;iPhone 14&zwnj; users for a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/15/emergency-sos-extra-year-iphone-14/">total of three years</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Apple has said it eventually plans to charge for satellite services, but no pricing has been unveiled. The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a> models also came with two free years of satellite access.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/10/you-can-send-texts-via-satellite-in-ios-18/">You Can Send Texts via Satellite in iOS 18</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/you-can-send-texts-via-satellite-in-ios-18.2428704/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today confirmed that it plans to implement support for Rich Communication Services, or <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/rcs/">RCS</a>, in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a> this fall. Apple software chief Craig Federighi confirmed &zwnj;RCS&zwnj; support when introducing new features for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> at the WWDC keynote event.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/apple-rcs-thumb.jpg" alt="" width="2776" height="1562" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-923042" /><br/>
We've known about Apple's plans to adopt &zwnj;RCS&zwnj; since last November, but Apple only gave a vague "later in 2024" timeline for adoption so it was unclear exactly when the feature might roll out. &zwnj;RCS&zwnj; replaces SMS/MMS as the default communication protocol on the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;. <br/>
<br/>
&zwnj;RCS&zwnj; has already been adopted by Google, U.S. smartphone carriers, and other companies, so Apple is a little late to the party. It doesn't change much for iMessage, but it does overhaul the way iPhones interact with Android devices. &zwnj;RCS&zwnj; improves texting with Android users, adding support for features that have previously been limited to iMessage. Some of the additions: <br/>
<br/>
<ul><br/>
 <li>Support for higher resolution photos and videos.</li><br/>
 <li>Support for larger file sizes and file sharing.</li><br/>
 <li>Audio messages.</li><br/>
 <li>Cross-platform emoji reactions.</li><br/>
 <li>Real-time typing indicators.</li><br/>
 <li>Read receipts.</li><br/>
 <li>Ability to send messages over cellular or Wi-Fi (SMS is cellular only). There is no cost to send an &zwnj;RCS&zwnj; message over Wi-Fi.</li><br/>
 <li>Improved group chats.</li><br/>
</ul><br/>
<br/>
It is not clear if Apple will introduce &zwnj;RCS&zwnj; support during the &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj; beta testing period or hold the feature until the fall public launch of the update, but we do know that it is indeed tied to &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj; at this point. <div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/rcs/">RCS</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/10/rcs-coming-to-messages-in-ios-18/">RCS Coming to Messages in iOS 18 for Improved Texts With Android Users</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/rcs-coming-to-messages-in-ios-18-for-improved-texts-with-android-users.2428700/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/macOS-Sequoia-Passwords-app.jpg" alt="" width="1960" height="1102" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-954590" /><br/>
The Passwords app replaces <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/icloud/">iCloud</a> Keychain, which is currently only accessible via a menu in Settings. Now, passwords are available directly via a standalone app for markedly quicker access, bringing it more in line with rival services.<br/>
<br/>
The Passwords app consolidates various credentials, including passwords, passkeys, and Wi-Fi passwords, into a single, easily accessible location. Users can filter and sort their accounts based on various criteria, such as recently created accounts, credential type, or membership in shared groups. <br/>
<br/>
Passwords is also compatible with Windows via the &zwnj;iCloud&zwnj; for Windows app, extending its utility to users who operate across different platforms. <br/>
<br/>
The developer beta versions of &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj;, iPadOS 18, and &zwnj;macOS Sequoia&zwnj; are available today with official release to the public scheduled for the fall, providing an early look at the Passwords app.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/icloud-keychain/">iCloud Keychain</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/10/apple-introduces-standalone-passwords-app/">Apple Introduces Standalone &#039;Passwords&#039; App</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-introduces-standalone-passwords-app.2428694/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

<br/>
With head gestures, users can control <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a> on the &zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj; with a shake or a nod of the head. If you get a phone call, for example, you can shake your head no if you don't want to answer it, or nod to accept the call. &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; interactions can be used for responding to incoming messages, calls, and notifications.<br/>
<br/>
Apple is adding Voice Isolation to the &zwnj;AirPods Pro&zwnj; to cut down on loud background sounds to make you easier to hear, and there is a new Personalized Spatial Audio feature specific to gaming. Game developers will be able to incorporate spatial audio into their games for a more immersive audio experience.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/">AirPods Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AirPods-Pro">AirPods Pro (Neutral)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/airpods.216">AirPods</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/10/apple-releases-new-airpods-pro-2-beta-firmware/">Apple Releases New AirPods Pro 2 Beta Firmware With Support for iOS 18 Features</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-releases-new-airpods-pro-2-beta-firmware-with-support-for-ios-18-features.2428693/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>
