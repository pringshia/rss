		<description><![CDATA[The Apple Watch Ultra is considerably more popular than the entry-level <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch-se/">Apple Watch SE</a> despite its high price point, according to a <a href="https://cirpapple.substack.com/p/apple-watch-models-trend-toward-the">new report</a> from Consumer Intelligence Research Partners (CIRP).<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/09/apple-watch-ultra-1-1.jpg" alt="" width="3840" height="2160" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-866346" /><br/>
The report provides a detailed look at how the various Apple Watch models are performing in the market. <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch/">Apple Watch Series 9</a>, introduced in September 2023 alongside the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a> lineup, is the most popular model in the lineup as of the June 2024 quarter. It captured 43% of total Apple Watch sales in the United States, making it the top choice among customers. The Series 8, which Apple no longer sells directly but is still available through various retailers, followed with a 19% share. Combined, these two models accounted for nearly two-thirds of all Apple Watch sales during the period.<br/>
<br/>
The Apple Watch Ultra and Ultra 2, which represent the high-end segment of the lineup, contributed 20% of total sales. Despite their advanced features and premium positioning, the Ultra models have a smaller market share compared to the high-end variants of other Apple products like the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>. For instance, premium models in these categories typically account for a quarter or more of total sales. The CIRP report indicates that the Ultra 2 had a slightly higher share than the original Ultra during the June 2024 quarter.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/08/cirp-apple-watch.jpg" alt="" width="1127" height="827" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-961744" /><br/>
The &zwnj;Apple Watch SE&zwnj; held a 12% market share. This model continues to attract buyers who are looking for a more affordable entry point into the Apple Watch, yet its market presence is significantly smaller than that of the higher end models. The Nike-branded version of the Apple Watch, which is essentially a variant of the Series 8 and 9, accounted for a modest 5% of the market.<br/>
<br/>
Apple's strategy of offering a range of models at different price points appears to mirror its approach with the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPad&zwnj;. However, there are some notable differences in consumer behavior across these product lines. While the premium models of &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; often capture a larger share of sales, the Apple Watch lineup sees stronger performance in its mid-range models. The CIRP report suggests that the Series 8 and Series 9, positioned as a mid-tier option in terms of pricing and features, is particularly attractive to consumers, while the Ultra models, despite their higher price and more advanced capabilities, appeal to a smaller segment of the market. The low-cost &zwnj;Apple Watch SE&zwnj; and Nike models appeal to an even smaller segment of the market.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch/">Apple Watch Series 9</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch-se/">Apple Watch SE</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch-ultra/">Apple Watch Ultra 2</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/cirp/">CIRP</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch">Apple Watch (Don't Buy)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch_SE">Apple Watch SE (Don't Buy)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch_Ultra">Apple Watch Ultra (Don't Buy)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-watch.172">Apple Watch</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/15/apple-watch-ultra-more-popular-than-se/">Report: Apple Watch Ultra More Popular Than Apple Watch SE</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/report-apple-watch-ultra-more-popular-than-apple-watch-se.2433700/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

Power.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/02/apple-card-1.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-785924" /><br/>
As highlighted by Apple in a <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2024/08/apple-card-named-best-in-customer-satisfaction-by-jd-power/">press release</a> earlier today, this is the fourth year in a row that the &zwnj;Apple Card&zwnj;, issued by Goldman Sachs, has earned the top spot in J.D. Power's 2024 U.S. Credit Card Satisfaction Study. The study measures overall customer satisfaction by assessing performance across several categories, including Account Management, Customer Service, and New Account Experience. <br/>
<br/>
The &zwnj;Apple Card&zwnj; was first introduced in 2019 and is deeply integrated into the Wallet app on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>, allowing users to track their spending in real time, categorize transactions, and set up payment plans. The &zwnj;Apple Card&zwnj; also offers up to three percent Daily Cash on purchases, which can be used instantly or saved for future expenses. With &zwnj;Apple Card&zwnj; Family, users can share an &zwnj;Apple Card&zwnj; account with other members of their Family Sharing group. The &zwnj;Apple Card&zwnj; also features an integrated a Savings account option, providing users with the ability to automatically deposit their Daily Cash rewards into the account.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-card/">Apple Card</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/15/apple-card-named-best-in-customer-satisfaction/">Apple Card Named Best in Customer Satisfaction for Fourth Year</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-card-named-best-in-customer-satisfaction-for-fourth-year.2433696/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Following a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/08/09/beats-fit-pro-kim-kardashian-colors/">successful 2022 collaboration with Kim Kardashian</a> for a set of three neutral color options for the Beats Fit Pro earphones, the <a href="http://apple.com/beatsxkim">"Beats x Kim" campaign is back</a> to bring the same colors to the Beats Studio Pro headphones.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/08/kim-kardashian-beats-studio-pro.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-961587" /><br/>
As with the Beats Fit Pro, the new Beats Studio Pro color options from Kardashian's signature palette include Moon (light), Dune (medium), and Earth (deep).<blockquote>"I'm so excited we're bringing these three popular, chic colors to Beats' most iconic and advanced headphones," said Kim Kardashian. "Beats Studio have always been a fashion statement, so I can't wait to see how everyone styles them."</blockquote>Beats Studio Pro are the brand's latest over-ear headphones and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/07/19/beats-studio-pro-debut/">were originally released in July 2023</a>. They offer Active Noise Cancellation and Transparency modes, Personalized Spatial Audio with dynamic head tracking, improved audio quality, and up to 40 hours of battery life. Connectivity options include Class 1 Bluetooth, USB-C, and 3.5mm analog.<br/>
<br/>
Apple's Beats brand has been building up to today's launch with an ad campaign featuring Kardashian and Jimmy Fallon vying for the next Beats collaboration, with Kardashian's neutral Beats x Kim colors going up against a mustard-yellow "Beats x Jim" option that apparently did not make the cut.<br/>

		<title>AltStore Pal Now Free Thanks to &#039;MegaGrant&#039; From Epic Games</title>

		<description><![CDATA[<a href="https://altstore.io/">AltStore PAL</a>, the open-source app that is designed to distribute apps in the EU from independent developers, is now free thanks to a grant provided by <em>Fortnite</em> developer <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/epic-games/">Epic Games</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/04/altstore-pal-eu.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-947008" /><br/>
The alternative iOS app store had charged a €1.50 plus tax annual subscription, in order to cover Apple's Core Technology Fee (CTF). Apple's terms for alternative app marketplaces requires developers to pay the CTF for each annual app installation.<br/>
<br/>
However, AltStore Pal will no longer pass on the cost of this fee after the third-party store received a "<a href="https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/megagrants">MegaGrant</a>" from &zwnj;Epic Games&zwnj;. <a href="https://x.com/altstoreio/status/1823826482046886273">AltStore said</a> that existing subscribers won't be charged upon their renewal date, and that the AltStore team plans to "show our appreciation for our existing subscribers in a future update," but didn't go into details.<br/>
<br/>
Developer Riley Testut has been working on AltStore PAL since Apple announced plans to support alternative app marketplaces in iOS 17.4. It is open to all apps, but Testut says that it makes the most sense for "smaller, indie apps that otherwise couldn't exist due to ‌<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a>‌ rules."<br/>
<br/>
AltStore PAL is equipped with Patreon integration to allow developers to monetize their apps. Developers can offer their apps to just their patrons, and this method of distribution also allows for a sub-1 million cap on those who can subscribe to use an app.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple has made available the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/12/apple-seeds-ios-18-1-beta-2-to-developers/">second developer beta</a> of macOS Sequoia 15.1, which includes the ability to test Apple Intelligence features. If you have an Apple silicon Mac and don't live in China, you can try Apple Intelligence features for yourself, even if you're not a developer. Keep reading to learn how.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/08/macOS-Sequoia-Night-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-961501" /><br/>
Apple has split Apple Intelligence into a separate set of betas for Macs because these features will not be available in the initial launch version of ‌macOS Sequoia‌ 15. Apple Intelligence will be available to the public later in the fall with the release of macOS Sequoia 15.1. <br/>
<br/>
This point release will add several of the Apple Intelligence features, such as Writing Tools, an updated Siri design, Safari and Mail summaries, Reduce Interruptions Focus mode, and more. Other features, including Image Playground, Genmoji, and the Siri personal context and onscreen awareness will be coming later and are not in the macOS Sequoia 15.1 beta. You can learn more about what's available and when in our <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sequoia/#apple_intelligence">macOS 15 roundup</a>.<br/>
<br/>
The good news is that Apple has already seeded the second developer beta of macOS 15.1, which means you can try some of the AI features out for yourself by signing up for macOS beta access. Signing up to get the macOS Sequoia beta is simple, and can be done by following the steps below. Be sure to back up your Mac using Time Machine before going on to follow the beta software installation steps, otherwise you won't be able to revert back to your previous version of macOS if you need to.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Things to Remember Before You Start</h2><br/>
<ul><br/>
<li>Back up Your Mac.</li><br/>
<li>Apple Intelligence requires a Mac with an M1 Apple silicon processor or later.</li><br/>
<li>Apple Intelligence is only available in US English.</li><br/>
<li>Apple Intelligence for Mac is not available in China, but appears to be available in the EU and everywhere else when region and language settings are changed to United States (see below).</li><br/>
<li>Apple Intelligence is not available if macOS 15.1 is installed on an external drive.</li></ul><br/>
<br/>
<h2>Register for Developer Beta Access</h2><br/>
You can skip this first set of steps if you have previously joined the Apple Developer Program with your Apple ID. Note that registering in this way is free, and <strong>does not require paying for an Apple Developer Program membership</strong>.<br/>
<ol><br/>
  <li>Go to the Apple Developer website (<a href="https://developer.apple.com/account">developer.apple.com/account</a>) and sign in with your Apple ID.</li><br/>
  <li>Check the box to accept the terms and conditions, then tap the <strong>Submit</strong> button.</li><br/>
</ol><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/08/apple-developer-website.jpg" alt="apple developer" width="1361" height="872" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-961716" /><br/>
<br/>
That's all there is to it. You can now proceed to the next steps to download and install the macOS Sequoia 15.1 developer beta.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Download macOS 15.1 Beta</h2><br/>

</ol><br/>
<br/>
<h2>Activate Apple Intelligence</h2><br/>
The following steps explain how to join the Apple Intelligence waitlist, which usually grants you access to the AI features in just a few minutes.<br/>
<ol><br/>

<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/08/2macos-apple-intelligence.jpg" alt="settings" width="1464" height="1141" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-961720" /><br/>
  <li>Next, go to <strong>System Settings ➝ General ➝ Language & Region</strong>.</li><br/>
  <li>Click the "Region" selector and choose <strong>United States</strong>.</li><br/>
  <li>Under "Preferred Languages," click <strong>+</strong> and add <strong>English (US)</strong>, then set English (US) as the Primary language by dragging it above your other language(s).</li><br/>
  <li>Restart your Mac when prompted.<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/08/1macos-apple-intelligence.jpg" alt="settings" width="1472" height="901" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-961721" /><br/>
  <li>After restarting, go to <strong>Settings ➝ Apple Intelligence & Siri</strong>.</li><br/>
  <li>Click the option to <strong>Join the Apple Intelligence waitlist</strong>. You will be notified when Apple Intelligence features are available for your Mac. In most cases this should take only a few minutes, but don't rule out waiting a couple of hours.</li><br/>
<li>When Apple Intelligence is available, toggle the switch to enable it.<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/08/3macos-apple-intelligence.jpg" alt="settings" width="1475" height="904" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-961722" /><br/>
</ol>Note that Apple Intelligence will not be in the initial launch version of iOS 18 that comes out in September alongside new iPhones. It will instead be introduced in a separate iOS 18.1 update that is likely to come out a few weeks after ‌iOS 18‌ debuts. Have you had a chance to try out Apple Intelligence features on Mac?

While Sonos has been working to address a number of missing features and issues with the new app and has laid out a timeline to keep users updated on the company's progress, <em>The Verge</em> reports that "discussions high up within Sonos" have centered around potentially offering the old app as an interim solution.<blockquote>Letting customers fall back to the older software could ease their frustrations and reduce at least some of the pressure on Sonos to rectify every issue with the new app. At least for now, the redesigned version is all that’s available, which makes it impossible for some customers to avoid its flaws.</blockquote>Just last week, Sonos CEO Patrick Spence <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/08/sonos-delays-product-launces-to-fix-app/">revealed on the company's earnings call</a> that it will be delaying two upcoming product launches due to "challenges with our new app." While Spence did not identify the products in question, one of them is likely to be the successor to the company's flagship Arc soundbar.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/sonos/">Sonos</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/14/sonos-bring-back-old-app/">Sonos Considering Bringing Back Its Old Mobile App Amid Ongoing Issues</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/sonos-considering-bringing-back-its-old-mobile-app-amid-ongoing-issues.2433647/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple is moving forward with its project to develop a tabletop robotic device, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-08-14/apple-pushes-ahead-with-tabletop-home-device-in-shift-to-robotics">according to <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/04/HomePod-G4-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-793597" /><em>MacRumors rendering of a similar device based on the G4 <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/">iMac</a></em></div><br/>
The device would feature a large iPad-like display mounted on a "thin robotic arm" that would allow the display to tilt and up and down and rotate a full 360º, and it would serve as a "smart home command center," a videoconferencing machine such as for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/facetime/">FaceTime</a> calls, and a home security monitoring tool.<br/>
<br/>
The tabletop robot would leverage <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a> and Apple Intelligence, allowing it to respond to an array of verbal commands, recognize different voices, and automatically orient the display to face users in the room. <br/>
<br/>
While Apple has been toying with the idea for some time, Gurman says Apple has recently prioritized development of the device, putting it under the purview of Kevin Lynch, Apple's vice president of technology who has overseen such projects as the Apple Watch and Apple's defunct self-driving car venture.<br/>
<br/>
Apple is now looking to launch the device as soon as 2026 or 2027 and is aiming to get the price down to around &#36;1,000, though plans may change as development proceeds.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/bloomberg-com/">Bloomberg</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/14/apple-tabletop-robotic-home-device-2026/">Apple Aiming to Launch Tabletop Robotic Home Device as Soon as 2026 With Pricing Around &#36;1,000</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-aiming-to-launch-tabletop-robotic-home-device-as-soon-as-2026-with-pricing-around-1-000.2433643/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Amazon today has the Apple Studio Display for <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB09V3GZD32%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1"><strong>&#36;1,299.99</strong></a>, down from &#36;1,599.00, which is a match of the all-time low price on the monitor. This is the standard glass version of the Studio Display with the tilt adjustable stand, and Amazon also has a few other models on sale as well.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/03/apple-studio-display-blue.jpg" alt="" width="2250" height="1266" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-839183" /><em><small>Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with Amazon. When you click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment, which helps us keep the site running.</small></em><br/>
<br/>
You can get the standard glass model with the VESA Mount Adapter for <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB09V3HGN6Q%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1"><strong>&#36;1,299.99</strong></a>, while the tilt- and height-adjustable stand model is available for <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB09V3HMZW5%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1"><strong>&#36;1,599.00</strong></a>, down from &#36;1,999.00. Both of these are record low prices on the display.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB09V3GZD32%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1"target="_blank"><div class="fancybutton"><div class="fancybadge">&#36;299 OFF</div>Standard Glass Apple Studio Display for &#36;1,299.99</div></a></div><br/>
<br/>
If you want to upgrade to the nano-texture glass option, Amazon also has this model of the Studio Display on sale. It's available for <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB09V3HP4KL%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1"><strong>&#36;1,599.00</strong></a>, down from &#36;1,899.00, which is a second-best price on the Studio Display with nano-texture glass.<br/>
<br/>
The Studio Display features a 27-inch 5K retina display with a 5120 x 2880 resolution and up to 600 nits of brightness. Apple says that the standard display is engineered for "extremely low reflectivity," but for rooms where there is a lot of glare, Apple suggests the nano-texture glass option with even less reflectivity.<br/>

		<title>Halide 2.15 Lets Users Take Shots With Zero Computational Processing</title>

		<description><![CDATA[Award-winning iPhone camera app <a href="https://halide.cam">Halide</a> was today updated to version 2.15, which includes a new feature that allows users to take photos devoid of all image processing for a more natural look.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/08/halide-process-zero-update.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-961650" /><br/>
Halide's new image processing pipeline is called "<a href="http://www.lux.camera/introducing-process-zero-for-iphone/">Process Zero</a>," which uses "zero AI, no computational photography whatsoever – offering photographers a counter to the increasingly AI-heavy processing and tooling on smartphones," according to app developer Lux Optics. <br/>
<br/>
Process Zero uses a fast process based on a single exposure RAW file. The file itself is a 12 megapixel image plus a RAW DNG file for additional editing. <br/>
<br/>
"Process Zero is fast, capturing at anywhere from 10 — 25× the speed of a ProRAW capture. Much like film, it can feature natural sensor grain, slight color aberrations, and is much less usable in low light. This makes for its natural look, like taking photos on an older classic digital camera," explain the developers.<br/>
<br/>
Halide 2.15 still allows photographers the choice of process before or during shooting – users can choose processing at setup, or while shooting, picking from ProRAW, standard iPhone photo processing, reduced image processing, or Process Zero. <br/>
<br/>
In addition, the Halide update includes a dial in the app's new Image Lab which lets users re-develop the RAW file with Process Zero for different exposure levels. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/08/halide-Process-Choice.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1173" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-961653" /><br/>
Lux Optics is eager to stress that many of Apple's image processing features still benefit users, but with Process Zero they can see exactly what images look like when it's completely taken away.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/halide-mark-ii-by-lux-camera/id885697368">Halide 2.15</a> is available today from the App Store with a limited 1-week discount on all new Halide memberships for &#36;11.99 per year (usual price is &#36;19.99). There is also a 1-week free trial with a membership, or users can opt for a lifetime purchase of &#36;59.99.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/halide/">Halide</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/14/halide-2-15-lets-users-take-shots-with-zero-computational-processing/">Halide 2.15 Lets Users Take Shots With Zero Computational Processing</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/halide-2-15-lets-users-take-shots-with-zero-computational-processing.2433637/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2024/08/developers-can-soon-offer-in-app-nfc-transactions-using-the-secure-element/">announced</a> that developers will soon be able to offer NFC transactions in their own apps for the first time – something that is mostly exclusive to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-pay/">Apple Pay</a> at present.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/07/Apple-Tap-to-Pay-on-iPhone-avail-UK-transaction.jpg" alt="" width="1960" height="1306" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-903160" /><br/>
Starting with iOS 18.1 later this year, developers will be able to offer in-app contactless transactions, separate from &zwnj;Apple Pay&zwnj; and Apple Wallet, using new APIs. This opens up new possibilities for in-store payments, car keys, closed-loop transit, corporate badges, student IDs, home keys, hotel keys, merchant loyalty and rewards cards, and event tickets, as well as government IDs in the future. The APIs use the Secure Enclave inside the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>, a certified chip that stores sensitive information directly on the device itself.<br/>
<br/>
Users will be able to use an app that features these APIs either by opening the app directly or setting it as their default contactless app in Settings to double-click the Side button and initiate the transaction.<br/>
<br/>
Developers will need to request the NFC and Secure Enclave entitlement, enter into a commercial agreement with Apple, and pay the associated fees. Apple says this ensures that only authorized developers who meet certain regulatory and industry requirements and commit to Apple's security and privacy standards can gain access to the APIs.<br/>
<br/>
The NFC and Secure Enclave APIs will be available to developers in Australia, Brazil, Canada, Japan, New Zealand, the UK, and the U.S. in an upcoming developer seed for iOS 18.1, with more regions to follow.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/nfc/">NFC</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-pay/">Apple Pay</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/14/apple-opening-up-iphones-nfc-chip-to-developers/">Apple Opening Up iPhone&#039;s NFC Chip to Third-Party Developers in iOS 18.1</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-opening-up-iphones-nfc-chip-to-third-party-developers-in-ios-18-1.2433629/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[In <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a>, currently in beta, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> apps have both Light and Dark color options, making it possible to match the color of your icons when you have Dark mode enabled. Keep reading to learn how it works.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/ios-18-dark-mode-icons.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-956931" /><br/>
Apple's built-in apps have both Light and Dark color options in &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj;, and third-party apps will likely provide their own Light and Dark icon alternatives to match your preferred aesthetic when &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj; is released to the public, but until then your &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; will happily generate dark versions of them, too.<br/>
<br/>
The Dark icons are all redesigned with a black background rather than a white or colored background, which makes them blend in better with the ‌<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ios-dark-mode/">Dark Mode</a>‌ setting. In addition, it's possible to turn on Dark icons independently of having ‌&zwnj;Dark Mode&zwnj;‌ enabled, so you can leave Light mode on while using the Dark icon option if you prefer.<br/>
<br/>
To go along with the ‌&zwnj;Dark Mode&zwnj;‌ icons, Apple also introduced a toggle that makes your wallpaper darker. The following steps explain how to switch your icon colors to match Light or Dark mode.<br/>
<ol><br/>
  <li>Press and hold a space on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/home-screen/">Home Screen</a> or an app page to enter jiggle mode.</li><br/>
  <li>Tap <strong>Edit</strong> in the top-left corner.</li><br/>
  <li>Select <strong>Customize</strong> in the dropdown menu.</li><br/>
  <li>Choose <strong>Dark</strong>, <strong>Light</strong>, or <strong>Automatic</strong> in the customization panel. (Automatic will lighten or darken the icons depending on whether Light or Dark mode is enabled.)</li><br/>
<li>Tap anywhere outside the customization panel to close it and exit jiggle mode.</li><br/>
</ol><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/08/change-dark-mode-icons.jpg" alt="" width="4377" height="2796" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-961676" /><br/>
<br/>
Note that the customization panel has other new settings including one to darken your wallpaper (the sun icon), an option to make icons bigger or smaller, and a Tint option that will put a tint over all of your icons (you can even match the tint with a color from your wallpaper using an eyedropper icon).  <br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/ios-make-home-screen-icons-dark/">iOS 18: Make Your iPhone Home Screen Icons Dark</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-18-make-your-iphone-home-screen-icons-dark.2433627/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today shared a new ad titled "The Relay" focused on athletic accessibility with the tagline "designed for every body."<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BPqir3EZolw?si=dVNBIQenl33gev8e" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><br/>
Shared ahead of the 2024 Paralympic Games in Paris, the ad shows some of the routines, training, and competitions undertaken by disabled athletes across a wide range of sports, assisted by Apple devices. It emphasizes inclusivity and the universality of competitive sport, regardless of one's physical disabilities.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote>Apple products are designed for every body. Whether you're a sprinter, wheelchair racer, track cyclist, or swimmer, features like the Workout app on Apple Watch, sleep metrics, and daily exercise goals — along with the ability to record and analyze your performance on iPad and Mac — ensure that all athletes have what they need to train and compete at their best.<br/>
<br/>
And innovative accessibility features like Point and Speak on iPhone, for users with low vision, or AssistiveTouch (which helps those with upper-limb difference use Apple Watch one-handed) further equip adaptive athletes with the ability to excel equally.</blockquote><br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Spotify says it has received approval from Apple to display pricing information in its iOS app for users in the European Union, following its years-long legal struggle with the company.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/06/Apple-vs-Spotify-feature2.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-801789" /><br/>
Spotify says that from Wednesday, iPhone users in the EU will be informed of pricing information in the app and the fact that they can go to the company's website to purchase items directly. <br/>
<br/>
"EU iPhone consumers will now benefit from seeing our end of summer promotional pricing," said Spotify in an <a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2024-03-04/the-european-commission-confirms-apples-anti-competitive-behavior-is-illegal-and-harms-consumers/">updated blog post</a>. "They'll also finally be able to see how much a Premium plan of their choosing costs once the promotion ends."<br/>
<br/>
The music streamer is not opting into Apple's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/08/app-store-external-links-european-union/">complicated new business rules</a> under the Digital Markets Act, but is instead taking advantage of Apple's "entitlement" for music streaming services – a result of the European Commission's decision on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/04/eu-fines-apple-2-billion/">March 4</a> which found that Apple violated the EU's antitrust laws and fined them over €1.8 billion. <br/>
<br/>
Spotify is still not giving users a link to click to make purchases from outside of the App Store, which it could have done under the entitlement terms, but it presumably does not want to give Apple a cut of any off-platform sales, which Apple would likely argue is a reflection of the value the App Store provides.<br/>
<blockquote>"Unfortunately, Spotify and all music streaming services in the EU are still not able to freely give consumers a simple opportunity to click a link to purchase in app because of the illegal and predatory taxes Apple continues to demand, despite the Commission's ruling.<br/>
<br/>
"The fight continues. iPhone consumers everywhere deserve basic information about how much things cost, when they can take advantage of great deals and promotions, and where to go to buy those things online. If the European Commission properly enforces its decision, iPhone consumers could see even more wins, like lower cost payment options and better product experiences in the app."</blockquote>Spotify has been in a legal spat with Apple in the EU <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2019/03/13/spotify-files-complaint-vs-apple-in-europe/">since 2019</a>, when it filed an antitrust complaint over App Store rules. As recently as March Spotify <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/14/spotify-no-apple-approval-subscription-update/">complained</a> to the Commission that Apple was failing to approve a Spotify update that adds information on subscription pricing and links its website.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/spotify/">Spotify</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/european-union/">European Union</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/antitrust/">Apple Antitrust</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/14/apple-allows-spotify-show-pricing-eu-app/">Apple Allows Spotify to Show Pricing Info to EU Users in iPhone App</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-allows-spotify-to-show-pricing-info-to-eu-users-in-iphone-app.2433612/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple is still working on a larger iMac with over a 30-inch display, but the development stage and potential release schedule for the all-in-one computer still remains largely unknown.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/01/iMac-Pro-2022-27-and-24-iMac.jpg" alt="" width="1626" height="914" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-833952" /><br/>
Following the launch of the Mac Studio and 27-inch Studio Display in March 2022, Apple discontinued the Intel-based 27-inch iMac. The company had already consigned the iMac Pro to its discontinued products list the previous March. Then in November 2023, Apple dashed hopes of a future 27-inch iMac when it confirmed to several publications that it had <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/06/no-27-inch-with-apple-silicon/">no plans to release such a machine</a>. <br/>
<br/>
Despite Apple's product reshuffle and its continued attempt to push customers to buy its 24-inch iMac or opt instead for a Mac Studio / Studio Display combo, there have been <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/06/26/imac-with-over-30-inch-display/">persistent rumors of a larger-screened iMac</a> in the works that has a display that's over 30 inches in size. The machine was said to be in the early stages of development in mid-2023, but until recently the rumor mill had gone all but quiet about its progress.<br/>
<br/>
Now, <em>Bloomberg</em> reporter Mark Gurman has offered a ray of hope for fans of a larger model. "A larger iMac remains something Apple is exploring," he wrote in his <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-08-11/iphone-16-preview-bigger-screens-new-colors-camera-button-ai-and-a18-chip-lzpk5495">latest weekly report</a>. However, Gurman still says it is unclear if the device will use Apple's latest M4 processor. Apple plans to update its 24-inch iMac to an M4 processor later this year, but Gurman's comments suggest that this could be too early for the larger model, given its current development phase. <br/>
<ul><li><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/09/m4-macbook-pro-mac-mini-imac-2024/">M4 MacBook Pro, iMac, and Redesigned Mac Mini Coming This Year</a></li></ul><br/>
Gurman in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/06/26/imac-with-over-30-inch-display/">June 2023</a> reported that Apple was in the early stages of developing a new iMac with over a 30-inch display, and that it was "further out," suggesting that it might be at least a year or two away from launching. Then in October 2023, Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said he expected a 32-inch iMac with a mini-LED display to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/17/32-inch-imac-coming-in-2025/">come out in 2025</a>. Kuo did not specify, but such a machine could be positioned as an "‌iMac‌ Pro" to replace the 2017 model that Apple discontinued in 2021.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/12/iMac-Pro-Mock-Graphic-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2250" height="1266" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-877852" /><br/>
So it seems Apple could still release a larger M4 iMac in 2025, alongside planned processor upgrades the MacBook Air, Mac Pro, and Mac Studio next year. Another possibility is that Apple will hold out for its M5 chip, which could see the bigger iMac arrive in 2026 or later. <br/>
<ul><li><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/09/when-to-expect-m4-macbook-air-mac-studio-mac-pro/">When to Expect New M4 MacBook Air, Mac Studio, and Mac Pro Models</a></li></ul><br/>
As the rumors indicate, the actual size of the bigger iMac that Apple is working on is still unclear, but the display is surely going to be over 30 inches. At 32 inches, it would offer the same dimensions as the 6K Pro Display XDR, which Apple sells for &#36;5,000. As for the design, we could perhaps see slimmer bezels and a machine that is ultimately modeled after the Studio Display, with Apple eliminating the chin, but rumors are not clear on this point.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/">iMac</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iMac">iMac (Neutral)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/imac.91">iMac</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/14/apple-still-working-on-larger-imac/">Apple Still Developing Bigger iMac With Over 30-Inch Display</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-still-developing-bigger-imac-with-over-30-inch-display.2433611/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Multiple rumors have suggested that the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a> models are going to have an all-new button that's designed to make it easier to capture photos when the devices are held in landscape mode.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/iPhone-16-Pro-Right-Side-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-928697" /><br/>
Apple calls the button the Capture Button internally, and it is going to be one of the most advanced buttons that's been introduced to date with support for multiple gestures and the ability to respond to pressure. Here's everything the button will be able to do, according to rumors:<br/>
<ul><br/>
 	<li>Lightly press on the button to autofocus while capturing an image or video.</li><br/>
 	<li>Press harder on the button to take a photo.</li><br/>
 	<li>Swipe left and right on the button to zoom in and out.</li><br/>
 	<li>There may also be a gesture for switching between photo mode and video mode, similar to how you can capture a video with a press and swipe in the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> camera app.</li><br/>
</ul><br/>
The ability to autofocus with a light press on the button will be a gesture that DSLR camera owners are used to, as this is often how you autofocus when using a high-end camera.<br/>
<br/>
Apple plans to put the button on the right side of the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;, in the space where the mmWave antenna is on iPhones that are sold in the United States. The mmWave antenna will be moving to the left side of the device to make space.<br/>
<br/>
The Capture Button has been depicted in CAD renders and dummy models of all four &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; devices, but <em>Bloomberg</em>'s <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a> <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-08-11/iphone-16-preview-bigger-screens-new-colors-camera-button-ai-and-a18-chip-lzpk5495">this week suggested</a> that there is a possibility that it will only be available on the Pro models.<br/>
<br/>
With the Capture Button, Apple will be able to encourage users to take images and videos captured in landscape orientation, which are better viewed on the Vision Pro headset.<br/>
<br/>
Along with a Capture Button, the &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; models will feature slightly bigger displays, a new A18 chip that supports Apple Intelligence, and 8GB RAM for all models, which is necessary to power Apple's AI models.

		<description><![CDATA[When introducing the new Pixel 9 models today, Google didn't miss an opportunity to denigrate Apple Intelligence. All of the new Pixel 9 devices are integrated with Google's AI technology, Gemini, and there are a host of new AI features that Google introduced.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ixZAvDCysNw" title="Your personal AI assistant | Gemini" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><br/>
Like Apple Intelligence, Gemini works using on-device processing power, but Google <a href="https://blog.google/products/pixel/google-pixel-9-new-ai-features/#pixel9phones">made sure to point out</a> that Gemini is capable enough to answer complex queries without handing a task off to another AI service. The comment was a dig at Apple's plan to add ChatGPT integration to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a>, as ChatGPT will be able to do things that &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; can't. From Google:<br/>
<blockquote>Gemini is deeply integrated with Google apps and Android and can handle complex queries without hand-off to third-party AI providers you may not know or trust.</blockquote><br/>
Apple will use ChatGPT for things like generating text from scratch, something that Apple Intelligence doesn't do. Apple did add Writing Tools, but it is limited to rewriting content that you've already written to change the tone or style. ChatGPT will also be able to generate images that Image Playground cannot, such as photorealistic content, and it will handle requests like generating meal recipes.<br/>
<br/>
When a user asks &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; something that &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; cannot handle, the personal assistant will ask for permission to hand it over to ChatGPT. ChatGPT integration is entirely optional, and OpenAI is partnering with Apple to bring it to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> users for free.<br/>
<br/>
Rumors suggest that Apple also plans to add Gemini integration to the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;, allowing &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; users to choose their preferred AI service. It's not quite clear if Apple Intelligence is incapable of handling full text generation and photorealistic image creation, or if these are capabilities that Apple feels are a little too questionable to touch given the sentiment about AI-created content.<br/>
<br/>
Google's new Pixel devices have several interesting AI features, including Pixel Studio, a new image generator that uses an on-device diffusion model. It will generate stickers and images using text prompts, similar to Image Playground.<br/>
<br/>
AI will be able to edit photos to add objects that weren't originally in the image, plus Google plans to use it for custom weather reports. The camera app has an option to merge two photos together so that the person taking a group photo can be in the picture, and it can catalog and remember information from screenshots. There's also a feature called Call Notes, which mimics Apple's call recording feature by recording and summarizing phone calls.<br/>
<br/>
Google has also added Gemini Live to the Pixel 9 devices and accompanying earbuds, with Gemini Live allowing users to have full free-flowing conversations with Gemini.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/13/google-gemini-ai-siri-shade/">Google Touts Pixel 9&#039;s Gemini AI Capabilities That Don&#039;t Require &#039;Hand-off to AI Providers You May Not Know or Trust&#039;</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/google-touts-pixel-9s-gemini-ai-capabilities-that-dont-require-hand-off-to-ai-providers-you-may-not-know-or-trust.2433585/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<title>iPhone Mirroring in macOS Sequoia and iOS 18 Now Supports Jiggle Mode for Managing Home Screen</title>

		<description><![CDATA[With the latest betas of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sequoia/">macOS Sequoia</a>, Apple added new functionality to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> Mirroring, the feature that lets you control your &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; from your Mac. When &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; Mirroring first debuted in the betas, there was no support for managing the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/home-screen/">Home Screen</a>, but that's now changed.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/08/iphone-mirroring-jiggle-mode.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-961621" /><br/>
Apple added an option to get into jiggle mode, as noted by <em><a href="https://9to5mac.com/2024/08/13/iphone-mirroring-jiggle-mode-ios-18-mac/">9to5Mac</a></em>. After activating the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; Mirroring app, you can click and hold on the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;'s &zwnj;Home Screen&zwnj; to activate jiggle mode. In this mode, you can do everything you can in jiggle mode on the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; itself, from deleting and rearranging apps to managing widgets.<br/>
<br/>
You can add widgets, change widget sizes, activate app long press functionality, turn on dark mode icons, or opt into icon tinting. There is no option to get to the Lock Screen or Control Center, though, and notifications can only be viewed through the Mac notification center.<br/>
<br/>
Apple added the new jiggle functionality in the &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj;, iOS 18.1, macOS 15, and macOS 15.1 betas, so if you have any of the developer or public betas, you should be able to use the new &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; Mirroring functionality as of now.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-18/">iPadOS 18</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sequoia/">macOS Sequoia</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-18.244">iOS 18</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-18.245">iPadOS 18</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macos-sequoia.246">macOS Sequoia</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/13/iphone-mirroring-jiggle-mode/">iPhone Mirroring in macOS Sequoia and iOS 18 Now Supports Jiggle Mode for Managing Home Screen</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-mirroring-in-macos-sequoia-and-ios-18-now-supports-jiggle-mode-for-managing-home-screen.2433583/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>
