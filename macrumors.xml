<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-783453" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/02/HomePodandMini-feature-green.jpg" alt="" width="1436" height="808" /><br/>
When paired with a device running &zwnj;iOS 17&zwnj; or &zwnj;iPadOS 17&zwnj;, the &zwnj;HomePod&zwnj; can initiate an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airplay/">AirPlay</a> session using a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a> command, making it easier to listen to music services like Spotify on the &zwnj;HomePod&zwnj; over &zwnj;AirPlay&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
The update also adds new call controls for muting or unmuting a call, and there is an Enhance Dialogue feature on the &zwnj;HomePod&zwnj; 2 that can prioritize spoken voices when used with the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a> 4K. Apple's full release notes for the update are below.<blockquote>Software version 17 includes support for your HomePod. This update also includes bug fixes and stability improvements.<br/>
<br/>
- Siri support for AirPlay allows you to start an AirPlay session from your iPhone or iPad directly on your HomePod using just your voice, so you can play an even wider range of third-party music services on HomePod.<br/>
<br/>
- New call controls enable you to mute or unmute a call on HomePod.<br/>
<br/>
- Enhance Dialogue on HomePod (2nd generation) gives you the option to hear spoken voices more clearly over background sounds when paired with Apple TV 4K.</blockquote>‌‌‌‌‌&zwnj;HomePod&zwnj;‌‌‌‌‌‌ software is installed automatically on the ‌‌‌‌‌‌&zwnj;HomePod&zwnj;‌‌ unless the feature is disabled‌‌‌‌, but the ‌‌‌‌‌‌&zwnj;HomePod&zwnj;‌‌‌‌‌‌ can also be manually updated in the Home app by following the instructions in our <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/homepod-software-update/">HomePod‌‌ update how to</a>.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod-mini/">HomePod mini</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod/">HomePod</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Homepod-Mini">HomePod Mini (Neutral)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#HomePod">HomePod (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/homepod-homekit-carplay-home-auto-technology.193">HomePod, HomeKit, CarPlay, Home & Auto Technology</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/18/apple-releases-homepod-17-software/">Apple Releases HomePod 17 Software With Siri AirPlay Enhancement, New Mute Controls and More</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-releases-homepod-17-software-with-siri-airplay-enhancement-new-mute-controls-and-more.2403036/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today released <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/watchos-10/">watchOS 10</a>, the newest version of the watchOS operating system designed to run on the Apple Watch. &zwnj;watchOS 10&zwnj; is compatible with the Apple Watch Series 4 and later.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zkYQdi12gX8" title="watchOS 10: All NEW Features You Need to Know!" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe><em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/macrumors?sub_confirmation=1">Subscribe to the MacRumors YouTube channel</a> for more videos.</em></div><br/>
&zwnj;watchOS 10&zwnj;, which carries build number 21R356, can be downloaded for free through the Apple Watch app on an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> running <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a> by opening it up and going to General > Software Update. To install the new software, the Apple Watch needs to have at least 50 percent battery and it needs to be placed on a charger.<br/>
<br/>
With &zwnj;watchOS 10&zwnj;, Apple overhauled the Apple Watch interface with a renewed focus on widgets. Turning the Digital Crown now brings up the widget Smart Stack, which displays the information that you need most, and it changes throughout the day. The Control Center is now activated with the side button rather than a swipe.<br/>
<br/>
Apple's built-in apps have been simplified with an information-forward design that developers will also be adopting. Maps, Messages, Activity, Heart, Home, and more have been revamped. There are two new watch faces, including the colorful Palette face and the Snoopy face featuring characters from the popular cartoon.<br/>
<br/>
There are updated Activity integrations for cyclists, as well as location features in the Compass app for hikers. The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-maps/">Apple Maps</a> app now shows topography, hiking trails, and points of interest, and there's a new mood tracking feature that can be accessed in the Mindfulness app. Apple's full release notes for the update are below.<blockquote>watchOS 10 is the biggest update since the introduction of Apple Watch, and brings a fresh look for virtually every app, new ways to navigate, and a new Smart Stack to display the information you need, right when you need it, from any watch face. It introduces enhanced capabilities for cycling workouts and hiking, a new mental health experience in the Mindfulness app to reflect on your state of mind, and the ability to track the time you spend in daylight.<br/>
<br/>

- Solar Analog features classic hour marks on a luminous dial with light and shadow that shift throughout the day in response to the position of the sun<br/>

- Cycling Speed view shows current and max speed, distance, heart rate, and/or power<br/>
- Cycle metrics, workout views, and cycling experiences from your Apple Watch can now appear as a Live Activity on iPhone, which can be mounted to the handlebar of your bike<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Activity</strong><br/>
- Icons in the corners provide quick access to Weekly Summary, Sharing, and awards<br/>
- Move, Exercise, and Stand Rings are visible on individual screens by scrolling the Digital Crown along with the ability to adjust goals, view steps, distance, flights climbed, and activity history<br/>
- Weekly Summary now includes Exercise and Stand totals in addition to the Move total<br/>
- Activity Sharing shows photos or avatars of your friends<br/>
- Trainer Tips from the expert trainers at Fitness+ provide guidance on areas like workout techniques, mindfulness, healthy habits, and staying motivated in the Fitness app on iPhone<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<strong>Mindfulness</strong><br/>

<br/>
<strong>Medications</strong><br/>
- Follow-up reminders notify you to log a medication if you haven't logged one 30 minutes after the scheduled time<br/>

<br/>
In tvOS 17, Apple has added a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/facetime/">FaceTime</a> app for &zwnj;FaceTime&zwnj; calls on a larger screen. The feature works through an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> or <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> running <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a>/<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-17/">iPadOS 17</a>, with the iOS device serving as the camera and the TV serving as the display.

		<description><![CDATA[While a tetraprism lens with up to 5x optical zoom is currently exclusive to the iPhone 15 Pro Max, the feature will expand to both the iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max next year, according to supply chain analyst Ming-Chi Kuo.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/03/iPhone-16-Mock-Header-1.jpg" alt="" width="2250" height="1266" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-888175" /><br/>
Kuo briefly revealed this information <a href="https://medium.com/@mingchikuo/iphone-15-pro-max%E7%9A%84%E4%BA%A4%E4%BB%98%E6%99%82%E9%96%93%E5%AE%8C%E5%85%A8%E5%8F%96%E6%B1%BA%E6%96%BC%E5%A4%A7%E7%AB%8B%E5%85%89%E7%8D%A8%E5%AE%B6%E4%BE%9B%E6%87%89%E4%B9%8B%E5%9B%9B%E9%87%8D%E5%8F%8D%E5%B0%84%E7%A8%9C%E9%8F%A1-%E6%BD%9B%E6%9C%9B%E9%8F%A1-%E9%8F%A1%E9%A0%AD%E4%B9%8B%E5%87%BA%E8%B2%A8%E9%87%8F-%E5%9B%9B%E9%87%8D%E5%8F%8D%E5%B0%84%E7%A8%9C%E9%8F%A1%E9%8F%A1%E9%A0%AD%E5%96%AE%E5%83%B9%E9%A1%AF%E8%91%97%E6%8F%90%E5%8D%8720-%E4%BB%A5%E4%B8%8A-iphone-15-pro-max-55a8711abb17">in a Medium post today</a> focused on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/18/kuo-apple-improving-iphone-15-pro-max-production/">iPhone 15 Pro Max production challenges</a> related to the camera.<br/>
<br/>
In the iPhone 15 Pro Max, the tetraprism lens system has a "folded" design that allows it to fit inside the smartphone, enabling <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/12/iphone-15-pro-max-25x-digital-zoom/">up to 5x optical zoom and up to 25x digital zoom</a>. By comparison, the smaller iPhone 15 Pro remains limited to up to 3x optical zoom, in line with the iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max.<br/>
<br/>
It has been rumored that the iPhone 16 Pro will feature a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/08/iphone-16-pro-larger-display-sizes/">larger 6.3-inch display</a>, compared to the 6.1-inch iPhone 15 Pro. This change would increase the overall size of the device, which would provide additional internal space for a tetraprism lens.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple has urgently addressed production challenges related to the iPhone 15 Pro Max's upgraded Telephoto camera system in order to boost supply of the device, according to <a href="https://medium.com/@mingchikuo/iphone-15-pro-max%E7%9A%84%E4%BA%A4%E4%BB%98%E6%99%82%E9%96%93%E5%AE%8C%E5%85%A8%E5%8F%96%E6%B1%BA%E6%96%BC%E5%A4%A7%E7%AB%8B%E5%85%89%E7%8D%A8%E5%AE%B6%E4%BE%9B%E6%87%89%E4%B9%8B%E5%9B%9B%E9%87%8D%E5%8F%8D%E5%B0%84%E7%A8%9C%E9%8F%A1-%E6%BD%9B%E6%9C%9B%E9%8F%A1-%E9%8F%A1%E9%A0%AD%E4%B9%8B%E5%87%BA%E8%B2%A8%E9%87%8F-%E5%9B%9B%E9%87%8D%E5%8F%8D%E5%B0%84%E7%A8%9C%E9%8F%A1%E9%8F%A1%E9%A0%AD%E5%96%AE%E5%83%B9%E9%A1%AF%E8%91%97%E6%8F%90%E5%8D%8720-%E4%BB%A5%E4%B8%8A-iphone-15-pro-max-55a8711abb17">research shared today</a> by supply chain analyst Ming-Chi Kuo.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/f-4d62f49966d4af93a651379f09657fba6cc3c770.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="898" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-910268" /><br/>
Kuo said the iPhone 15 Pro Max's tetraprism camera module <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/12/iphone-15-pro-max-25x-digital-zoom/">with up to 5x optical zoom</a> has been the most significant supply bottleneck for the device. In response, he said Apple has increased the specifications of the tetraprism lens supplied by Largan Precision in order to compensate for this. As a result of this change, and to meet strong demand for the iPhone 15 Pro Max overall, Kuo said Largan Precision has expanded its production lines for the tetraprism lens.<br/>
<br/>
iPhone 15 Pro Max shipping estimates range from 3-4 weeks for some configurations to 6-7 weeks for others. Yesterday, Kuo said iPhone 15 Pro Max demand had <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/17/kuo-iphone-15-pro-max-robust-demand/">outpaced iPhone 14 Pro Max demand</a> during the same period last year.<br/>
<br/>
In addition to the camera-related bottleneck, Kuo previously said that the iPhone 15 Pro Max entered mass production later than the other devices in the iPhone 15 series, which has presumably contributed to the device's lengthy shipping delays. In the U.S., the iPhone 15 Pro Max starts at &#36;1,199 with 256GB of storage.<br/>
<br/>
All of the iPhone 15 models are now available to order and launch this Friday.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/">Ming-Chi Kuo</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-15-Pro">iPhone 15 Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/18/kuo-apple-improving-iphone-15-pro-max-production/">Kuo: Apple Urgently Addressing iPhone 15 Pro Max Production Challenges to Boost Supply</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/kuo-apple-urgently-addressing-iphone-15-pro-max-production-challenges-to-boost-supply.2403015/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a> models are available in a range of color options, with entirely new hues available on both sets of devices, as well as some popular classics. The &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a> lineups have different colors to choose from, so if you have your heart set on a particular shade, you may not be able to get your preferred model in that color. This guide focuses on the &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; models, but for more information about the color options of the &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; Max, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone-15-pro-color-options/">check out our other color options guide</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/iPhone-15-Colors-blue.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="898" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-911673" /><br/>
The &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; Plus are available in a total of five colors, two of which are entirely new for this year's lineup. Although previous standard <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> color options have tended to be bolder and brighter, in 2023, Apple chose to offer a much more muted color palette due to its color-infused frosted glass back. The &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; Plus's color options are as follows:<br/>
<br/>
<ul><br/>
<li>Black</li><br/>
<li>Blue</li><br/>
<li>Green</li><br/>
<li>Yellow</li><br/>
<li>Pink</li><br/>
</ul><br/>
<br/>
Previous years' "Midnight" is now simply "Black" once again. This returns as the standard model's darkest color option, differing from Midnight since it no longer has a slight hint of navy blue. "Starlight," which replaced "White" several years ago, is no longer available, and there is no equivalent to either of these light, neutral color options in the &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; lineup.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/iPhone-15-and-15-Plus-Newsroom.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="630" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-910395" /><br/>
All of the other new colors, Blue, Green, Yellow, and Pink, are pale, muted pastel shades, toning down some of the options available with the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-14/">iPhone 14</a>. While they are quite understated colors, the overall look is very distinctive to the &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj;'s more refined design.<br/>
<br/>
Unlike previous &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; lineups, there is no PRODUCT(RED) &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj;. Apple usually releases a new &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; color option in the spring, so a PRODUCT(RED) &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; could potentially be in the pipeline for early 2024.<br/>
<br/>
<h3 id="how_to_decide_on_a_color">How to Decide on a Color</h3><br/>
If you use your &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; with a case, you may wish to consider which device color will best complement your case. You may prefer a more neutral tone such as Black and use a more colorful case. Alternatively, you could choose a more striking device color like Green or Pink and use a more neutral case. A case is definitely a good option for a bolder look, especially since the &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj;'s color options are generally so muted and pale.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/iphone-15-finewoven-cases.jpg" alt="" width="2984" height="1198" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-910345" /><br/>
Black may age better over time as new devices are released since it is a neutral, monochrome shade, and has effectively been offered across multiple &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; generations. If you do not use a case at all, you may wish to take advantage of a more eye-catching color option such as Yellow.<br/>
<br/>
If you want an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; in a brand new color for this year, Pink and Green are the best options. These colors are the most noticeably new and clearly indicate that you have the latest-generation device.<br/>
<br/>
Your choice of color may also be dependent on how often you upgrade your ‌&zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;‌. If you upgrade every year, you may be more confident in buying a more striking new color. If you upgrade more often, it can be a good idea to get a different color every time. A new finish can certainly add some novelty to purchasing a new ‌&zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;‌ and make it feel more different from your previous device. Alternatively, if you tend to keep your ‌&zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;‌ for many years and upgrade less often, it may be wiser to consider a color that is more similar to one you have enjoyed previously.<br/>
<br/>
Customers with multiple Apple devices may also want to get an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; color that complements their other devices. For example, if you have a Pink <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-watch-series-9/">Apple Watch Series 9</a>, it will be best complemented by the Pink &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj;. Likewise, if you already have a Space Gray MacBook Pro, it will likely be best accompanied by a Black &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj;.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-15">iPhone 15 (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99">iPhone</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone-15-color-options/">iPhone 15 Color Options: Which Did You Choose?</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-15-color-options-which-did-you-choose.2403006/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[At its iPhone 15 event last week, Apple announced <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/12/apple-announces-usb-c-iphone-airpods-earpods/">updated second-generation AirPods Pro</a> with a USB-C charging case, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/12/new-airpods-pro-features/">additional dust resistance</a>, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/13/apple-vision-pro-lossless-new-airpods-pro-2-only/">support for lossless audio with Apple's upcoming Vision Pro headset</a>. Apple still classifies these as second-generation AirPods Pro, and it does not sell the USB-C case separately.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/AirPods-USB-C-Port-Red-Triad.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-911678" /><br/>
The updated AirPods Pro have been available to order since last week, and will begin arriving to customers and launch in stores on Friday. Ahead of time, select media outlets and YouTube channels have shared first impressions of the updated earbuds.<br/>
<br/>
There is minimal commentary about the hardware changes, with most reviews agreeing that there is little reason for existing second-generation AirPods Pro users to upgrade. USB-C is a convenient addition, additional dust resistance is welcomed, and lossless audio support cannot be tested until the Vision Pro launches in the U.S. in early 2024.<br/>
<br/>
iOS 17 adds several features to all second-generation AirPods Pro, including <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ios-17-airpods/">Adaptive Audio, Conversation Awareness, and Personalized Volume</a>. Keep in mind that these software features are also available on the original second-generation AirPods Pro released in September 2022, so there is no need to update to the USB-C model to use them.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="https://www.theverge.com/23878402/apple-airpods-pro-usb-c-adaptive-audio-conversation-awareness-test-review"><em>The Verge</em>'s Chris Welch</a> on Adaptive Audio:<blockquote>Adaptive Audio is meant to be a set-it-and-forget-it mode that blends active noise cancellation and transparency, canceling loud distractions where needed while also helping you stay present in your environment. In my experience so far, this feature rarely cancels my surroundings to the same degree as the full noise cancellation mode (I wouldn’t use it on a plane), but it reduces outside sound enough to not take away from my music — even at lower volumes. To my ears so far, it’s basically an even smarter version of the adaptive transparency that Apple debuted with last year’s AirPods Pro.</blockquote><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/09/18/airpods-pro-get-usb-c-and-a-few-new-tricks/"><em>TechCrunch</em>'s Brian Heater</a> on Conversation Awareness:<blockquote>Conversational Awareness is a nice addition. It uses a combination of different sensors to determine when you’re talking. That includes obvious things like built-in mics, coupled with more surprising elements like the accelerometer, which detects vibration to determine that you are, in fact, the one who is talking, without having to resort to something like voice recognition. When that's triggered, the audio begins to lower, effectively getting out of your way when talking.<br/>
<br/>
I was impressed by the detection. It didn't trigger when I, say, coughed, yawned or cleared my throat. When I started talking, however, the music began to lower. It doesn't stay down for any specific set amount of time. The company says it relies on an algorithm to determine such things. Factors include the length of time you're talking, so it doesn't mistake a break in conversation for the end of one.</blockquote><a href="https://www.thestreet.com/deals/apple-airpods-pro-usb-c-review-adaptive-audio#adaptive-mode-is-a-smart-combination-of-transparency-and-noise-cancellation"><em>TheStreet</em>'s Jacob Krol</a> on both Adaptive Audio and Conversation Awareness:<blockquote>It feels almost magical as it works as intended. For instance, sitting in a bustling hotel lobby, you'll encounter background noise and chatter from other patrons nearby; once I engaged Adaptive, it lowers the brunt of the noise, and with music playing, it all becomes very faint. If a louder noise appears, like a cart being pushed through the space, it will process it in real time and lower it specifically.<br/>
<br/>
Let's take a more likely or commonly occurring scenario—I'm walking around my apartment with AirPods Pro, listening to some music with Adaptive on. It lowers the brunt of my HVAC system, similar to how the ANC performs, but I can hear a faint knock on my door as I'm expecting a package from FedEx. I open the door, and thanks to Conversation Awareness turned on, I can start talking, and AirPods Pro automatically switches to Transparency mode.<br/>
</blockquote><a href="https://www.inverse.com/tech/airpods-pro-2nd-gen-usb-c-review"><em>Inverse</em>'s Raymond Wong</a> on Personalized Volume:<blockquote>Personalized Volume uses machine learning to automatically adjust the volume just for your ears. Apple says Personalized Volume is determined by "environmental conditions and volume selections" over time. I didn't notice any meaningful volume adjustments over a week of testing so I turned it off.</blockquote><h2>Videos</h2><br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Amazon today has a collection of deals on Apple's iPad, including the 9th and 10th generation models. Both sales include matches of all-time low prices on these tablets.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>10th Gen iPad</h2><br/>
Starting with Apple's 10th generation 64GB Wi-Fi iPad, this model is available at the all-time low price of <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0BJLCL22Y%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1"><strong>&#36;399.00</strong></a>, down from &#36;449.00. The soonest the iPad can be delivered is around September 20, but some colors are seeing dates extend into October.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/04/10th-Gen-iPad-Feature-Deals-399-2.jpg" alt="" width="2880" height="1620" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-893587" /><em><small>Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with some of these vendors.

<br/>
Three colors are on sale, including Yellow, Blue, and Pink. You won't need any coupon code in order to get these record low prices, as they have been applied automatically by Amazon.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0BJLCL22Y%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1"target="_blank"><div class="fancybutton"><div class="fancybadge">&#36;50 OFF</div>10th Gen iPad (64GB Wi-Fi) for &#36;399.00</div></a></div><br/>

Only the 64GB Wi-Fi is getting a best-ever discount right now on Amazon, but there are a few solid second-best prices to check out. The 256GB Wi-Fi iPad is on sale for <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0BJLXMVMW%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"><strong>&#36;549.00</strong></a> in every color (&#36;50 off).

<br/>
<h2>9th Gen iPad</h2><br/>
There's also a solid discount on the previous-generation 9th generation iPad this week on Amazon. You can get the 64GB Wi-Fi iPad for <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB09G9CJM1Z%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"><strong>&#36;269.99</strong></a>, down from &#36;329.00.

		<description><![CDATA[It's taken this long, but in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a>, Apple has added support for multiple timers, and has also made it easy to manage several timers on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> with the introduction of labels. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/set-multiple-timers-ios.jpg" alt="timers" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-912030" /><br/>
That's right. Believe it or not, iPhones have not included the ability to set multiple ongoing timers until now. In &zwnj;iOS 17&zwnj;, the Clock app finally enables several timers to be set that will run down at the same time, allowing you to keep track of more than one thing, which is handy when cooking a meal that includes several dishes, for example.<br/>
<br/>
Not only can you have several timers counting down at the same time, you can also label timers, which helps you identify each one in your timer list. That way, you'll always know which timer relates to what, and you can save custom timers without having to remember what they were set up for.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/siri-suggestion-set-a-timer.jpg" alt="siri" width="1339" height="725" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-912032" /><br/>
To quickly set a timer on &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;, swipe down on the Home screen, search "timer," and tap the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a> Suggestion, or to set a timer with a name, say "&zwnj;Siri&zwnj;, set a timer called [name] for [duration]." Alternatively, open the Clock app and tap the Timers tab. In the timer setup options, select a duration, then tap the Label field and type in what you want to call it. <br/>
<br/>
Choose a distinct alert for the timer if it helps you recognize it. Note that in &zwnj;iOS 17&zwnj;, you also have the option of selecting one of several preset durations in the setup screen. When a timer is set, it will be added to your editable list of timers. For added convenience, the list will also include any recently completed timers that you used. <br/>
<br/>

If your &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; has a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/dynamic-island/">Dynamic Island</a>, the last timer you set will appear inside it when you are doing other things on your device. The most recently set timer will also appear as a Live Activity on the Lock Screen, and you can tap to expand it and see any other timers that are running concurrently. <br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/use-label-multiple-timers-ios/">iOS 17: How to Set and Label Multiple Timers</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-17-how-to-set-and-label-multiple-timers.2402991/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[At its "Wonderlust" event in 2023, alongside the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-watch-series-9/">Apple Watch Series 9</a>, Apple announced the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch-ultra/">Apple Watch Ultra 2</a>. The Apple Watch Ultra is a relatively new kind of smartwatch from Apple with a focus on withstanding extreme environments, a high level of durability, extended battery life, and additional features to aid activities like diving and exploration.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/Apple-Watch-Series-9-vs-Ultra-2-Buyers-Guide.jpg" alt="" width="2250" height="1265" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-911647" /><br/>
Both the &zwnj;Apple Watch Series 9&zwnj; and the &zwnj;Apple Watch Ultra 2&zwnj; feature the S9 chip, a second-generation Ultra Wideband chip, an Always-On Retina display, IP6X dust resistance, and more, but there are significant differences between the two devices.<br/>
<br/>
With as little as &#36;50 between the 45mm stainless steel &zwnj;Apple Watch Series 9&zwnj; and the Apple Watch Ultra, some prospective customers will be weighing up whether it is worth spending a little extra to get the 49mm Ultra model. While there is a &#36;400 difference between the 41mm aluminum &zwnj;Apple Watch Series 9&zwnj; and the Apple Watch Ultra, the high-end model offers a set of features to address specific challenges, so it may even be worth it for some of these buyers.<br/>

The Apple Watch Ultra offers specific capabilities to address the requirements of those who need their Apple Watch to provide assistance in challenging environments. If you need a more durable Apple Watch with features like a brighter display, louder speakers, a more reliable GPS, better water resistance, and more, the Apple Watch Ultra is undoubtedly the best choice. <br/>
<br/>
The Apple Watch Ultra is also the largest and most feature-rich Apple Watch option available, not to mention that it offers the first true redesign of the device since its introduction in 2015. For technology enthusiasts, Apple Watch Ultra represents a way to get a new Apple Watch experience with the top specifications. Features like longer battery life and a larger, brighter display are also highly accessible, and will be beneficial to all users. As such, some customers may still be inclined to choose the &zwnj;Apple Watch Ultra 2&zwnj; over the &zwnj;Apple Watch Series 9&zwnj;, even if they do not need it for use in challenging environments.<br/>
<br/>
As the largest Apple Watch model to date, the size of the Apple Watch Ultra will not be for everyone. If you already prefer the 41mm Apple Watch casing size, the Apple Watch Ultra may be far too large for you. If in doubt, it may be worth heading to an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-store/">Apple Store</a> and trying on the Apple Watch Ultra in person to get to grips with the size and determine if it is too big and bulky for you. <br/>
<br/>
Similarly, the Apple Watch Ultra's look may not appeal to some buyers. If you prefer the stainless steel Apple Watch and are looking for a more fashion-focused smartwatch that pairs well with premium bands, the more aggressive, rugged design of the Apple Watch Ultra may not be for you. <br/>
<br/>
If the Apple Watch Ultra is out of your price range but you still want to use your Apple Watch in challenging environments, it is worth bearing in mind that the Series 9 still offers a durable design with a strong front crystal, water resistance, and many of the &zwnj;Apple Watch Ultra 2&zwnj;'s software features like waypoint marking.<br/>
<br/>
The &zwnj;Apple Watch Ultra 2&zwnj; has a lot to offer, especially for the subset of users who can take advantage of all of its capabilities, so it is certainly worth considering when purchasing a new model, but the &zwnj;Apple Watch Series 9&zwnj; is still a compelling all-around option that comes in at a lower price point with a subtler design.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch/">Apple Watch Series 9</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch-ultra/">Apple Watch Ultra 2</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch">Apple Watch (Buy Now)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch_Ultra">Apple Watch Ultra (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-watch.172">Apple Watch</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-watch-series-9-vs-ultra-2/">Apple Watch Series 9 vs. Ultra 2 Buyer&#039;s Guide: 25 Differences Compared</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-watch-series-9-vs-ultra-2-buyers-guide-25-differences-compared.2402984/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[ProRes video recording remains limited to 1080p quality at 30 frames per second on the 128GB model of the iPhone 15 Pro, unless the device is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/13/iphone-15-pro-external-storage-prores/">recording directly to a connected external storage drive</a>, according to Apple. On the 256GB and higher iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max, ProRes video recording is supported in up to 4K quality at 60 frames per second to both internal storage and external storage.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/iPhone-15-Pro-lineup.jpg" alt="" width="2880" height="1620" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-910338" /><br/>
Apple does not mention this information on the iPhone 15 Pro's tech specs page on its website, but the limitation is listed when comparing the iPhone 15 Pro to another iPhone model in the Apple Store app, as seen in the screenshot below.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/iPhone-15-Pro-128GB-ProRes.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-912008" /><br/>
The same limitation applied to iPhone 13 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro models with 128GB of storage, but those devices cannot record ProRes video to external storage, so at least iPhone 15 Pro users have that option this time around. The limitation does not apply to the iPhone 15 Pro Max, as that model starts with 256GB of storage.<br/>
<br/>
ProRes video files are very large. Apple says a one-minute 10-bit ProRes video is approximately 1.7GB in 1080p and 6GB in 4K. Apple likely feels that offering 4K ProRes video recording to internal storage on the 128GB model would be a subpar user experience. With recording to an external storage now an option, it is less of an issue.<br/>
<br/>
Introduced on the iPhone 13 Pro models, ProRes refers to a family of codecs from Apple that can compress videos into smaller file sizes with "impressive image quality preservation." Apple says ProRes is designed as a final delivery format for high-quality videos like commercials, feature films, and broadcasts.<br/>
<br/>
ProRes video recording is still not supported at all on the standard iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-15-Pro">iPhone 15 Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/18/iphone-15-pro-128gb-prores-1080p-only/">Apple Says 128GB iPhone 15 Pro Limited to 1080p ProRes Video Recording Unless External Storage Connected</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-says-128gb-iphone-15-pro-limited-to-1080p-prores-video-recording-unless-external-storage-connected.2402975/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

<br/>

Last year, the biggest new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone-14-vs-iphone-14-pro/">differences between the iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Pro</a> were always-on functionality, the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/dynamic-island/">Dynamic Island</a>, three hours of battery life, and rear cameras with different apertures. With &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj;, both devices share new features like the USB-C port, second-generation Ultra Wideband chip, and next-generation portraits, but Apple's "Pro" and non-Pro &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; models are more different than ever.<br/>
<br/>
Our guide helps to answer the question of how to decide which of these two &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; models is best for you, and serves as a way to clearly see what additional features and upgrades the &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; brings to the table.<br/>

The &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; offers a large number of upgrades over the standard &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj;. With just &#36;200 difference to obtain a display with ProMotion and always-on functionality, the Action Button, and longer battery life, many customers will be able to justify getting the &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; over the &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj;. Other differences, such as the A17 Pro chip and 2GB additional memory are notable, but most significant are perhaps the devices' fundamentally different rear camera setups. The &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; unlocks 10 additional camera features and offers four additional or different pieces of camera hardware. Due to the scale and breadth of the &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj;'s improvements and features, most customers will be happy to choose the high-end model.<br/>
<br/>
The standard &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; still offers many of the &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj;'s most compelling capabilities, such as USB-C, &zwnj;Dynamic Island&zwnj;, and a 48-megapixel main camera, at a lower price point. It will only be worth getting the &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; over the &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; if you want a lighter device, do not care for the "Pro" rear camera setup or features like ProMotion and the always-on display, or cannot justify the &#36;200 to upgrade to the high-end model. In this instance, you will still benefit from the device's generous roster of advanced features. The &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; is still a very well designed and balanced device, especially for average customers and those coming from a much older model.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-15">iPhone 15 (Buy Now)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-15-Pro">iPhone 15 Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99">iPhone</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone-15-vs-iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 vs. iPhone 15 Pro Buyer&#039;s Guide: 35+ Differences Compared</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-15-vs-iphone-15-pro-buyers-guide-35-differences-compared.2402964/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple CEO Tim Cook confirmed in an interview with <em>CBS Sunday Morning</em>'s John Dickerson that the company's Vision Pro headset remains on schedule for release in early 2024, and revealed that he's already using it on a regular basis. <br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/M-FBYmIhRoo?si=Xf7CJ11sifs_ojXP" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><br/>
When asked how he uses the upcoming headset, Cook said he watched "the entire third season of 'Ted Lasso' on the Vision Pro," and admitted there are "some things I have access to that other people don't have access to, so I'm doing that, but that I can't talk to you about."<br/>
<br/>
Cook went on to say that the challenges Apple has faced creating the headset are "more complex" than making something like the iPhone, so it requires "more innovation, not only in the development but also in the manufacturing." However, the Apple chief batted away any suggestion that the company was <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/07/03/apple-vision-pro-drastic-production-cuts/">facing production issues</a> with the Vision Pro, saying the device was "on track" for a launch early next year.<br/>
<br/>
In the course of the interview, Cook also touched on other topics including Apple's environmental initiatives (he hopes other companies "rip it off"), whether Apple should be advertising on X, formerly known as Twitter, when its owner Elon Musk has been accused of promoting anti-Semitism on the platform ("It's something we constantly ask ourselves"), and the post-pandemic return to working in the office. <br/>
<br/>
In between a walk-and-talk around Apple's Austin, Texas campus, Cook was also filmed taking a sales call with a surprised customer. "The caller wanted to upgrade their iPhone," Cook later explained to Dickerson. When asked if he told her to hold out for the iPhone 15, Cook laughed. "I didn't exactly say that."   <br/>

		<description><![CDATA[In iOS 17 and tvOS 17, Apple has added a feature that lets Apple TV users locate a misplaced Siri Remote using their iPhone. Keep reading to learn how it's done.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/find-siri-remote-iphone.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-911918" /><br/>
Prior to the launch of the latest ‌Apple TV‌ 4K, there were rumors that Apple would build ‌Find My‌ functionality into the ‌Siri‌ Remote. That didn't happen, but in its latest major software updates, Apple has introduced a new iPhone option that does essentially the same thing. <br/>
<br/>
In early September, Apple quietly released new firmware for its second and third-generation Siri Remotes. With the new firmware, tvOS 17, and iOS 17, if a ‌Siri‌ Remote becomes lost, the ‌Apple TV‌ remote control available in the Control Center on an ‌iPhone‌ can be used to locate the missing remote.<br/>
<br/>
When enabled, users will see a Find My-like interface on their iPhone that guides them toward the remote, with an onscreen circle that changes in size to guide movement in the right direction. <br/>
<br/>
Note that Find My for the ‌Siri‌ Remote is available on the second and third-generation ‌Siri‌ Remotes, and the feature is limited to the ‌Apple TV‌ 4K models released in 2021 and 2022.<br/>
<br/>
Also, bear in mind that the updated firmware is necessary, and there is no established method for getting the ‌Siri‌ Remote to update. The ‌Apple TV‌ will need to be up to date, on, and connected to the ‌Siri‌ Remote to initiate, but there is no way to force the new firmware to download.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Find Your Siri Remote With Your iPhone</h2><br/>
<ol><li>Bring up the Control Center from your iPhone by swiping down from the upper right corner of the screen (on an ‌iPhone‌ with a Home button, swipe up from the bottom of the screen).</li><br/>
<li>Tap the <strong>Apple TV Remote</strong> button (if it's not there, you can <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/customize-control-center-ios-11/#customize">manually add it to Control Center</a>).</li><br/>
<li>Tap the chevron next to the name of the connected Siri Remote.<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/find-apple-tv-remote-with-iphone1.jpg" alt="control center" width="2738" height="2716" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-911920" /><br/>
<li>Tap the <strong>Find</strong> button next to the misplaced Siri Remote.</li><br/>
<li>Use the onscreen Find My-like interface to locate the remote. The size of the circle increases to guide movement in the correct direction. When your iPhone is right next to the remote, the screen shows a solid white orb.</li><br/>
<li>Tap the <strong>X</strong> button to close the location interface.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[In June, Apple announced <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a> with a wide range of new features and changes for the iPhone. Following over three months of beta testing, the free software update will be released this Monday, September 18 for the iPhone XS and newer.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/iOS-17-and-iPhones-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="1372" height="773" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-898529" /><br/>
Below, we have recapped 10 key features coming to the iPhone with iOS 17, with <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/13/ios-17-features-coming-later-this-year/">additional features coming later this year</a>. The update should be released to users around 10 a.m. Pacific Time / 1 p.m. Eastern Time today, and once it is available, it can be installed from the Settings app under General → Software Update.<br/>
<br/>
<h3>StandBy</h3><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/StandBy-iOS-17.jpg" alt="" width="1960" height="1102" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-898860" /><br/>
StandBy is a new full-screen view that provides glanceable information designed to be viewed from a distance when an iPhone is on its side and charging, according to Apple. The customizable interface can show a clock in various styles, a calendar, favorite photos, the weather forecast, music playback controls, widgets, and more.  <br/>
<br/>
StandBy is designed for an iPhone charging on a nightstand, kitchen counter, or desk, and it supports Live Activities, Siri, incoming calls, and larger notifications. The feature also works with the iPhone 14 Pro's always-on display.<br/>
<br/>
<h3>Contact Posters</h3><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/Contact-Posters-iOS-17.jpg" alt="" width="2612" height="1828" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-898862" /><br/>
iOS 17 lets users create a personalized Contact Poster that appears during an incoming phone call on another person's iPhone. The poster can include a photo or Memoji, and the font and background color can also be customized. The feature is available in the built-in Phone app and will also be available for third-party calling apps.<br/>
<br/>
<h3>NameDrop</h3><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/namedrop.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="894" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-898310" /><br/>
NameDrop allows users to easily share contact information by bringing their iPhones close together. Both individuals can choose the specific phone numbers or email addresses they would like to share, and can also share their Contact Posters.<br/>
<br/>
<h3>Live Voicemail</h3><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/Live-Voicemail-iOS-17.jpg" alt="" width="1306" height="793" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-898863" /><br/>
Live Voicemail provides real-time transcription on the screen as someone leaves a voicemail. If the user considers the voicemail to be important, they can pick up the call while the caller is leaving their message. Apple says calls identified as spam by carriers are not transcribed and will instead be instantly declined.<br/>
<br/>
<h3>Swipe to Reply in iMessage</h3><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/iMessage-Swipe-to-Reply.jpg" alt="" width="1330" height="794" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-898868" /><br/>
In the Messages app, users can now swipe to the right on any message to send an inline reply.<br/>
<br/>
<h3>Interactive Widgets</h3><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/iOS-17-Interactive-Widgets.jpeg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-898611" /><br/>
Interactive widgets are now available on the iPhone across the Home Screen, Lock Screen, and the new StandBy view. Apple gave some examples of what interactive widgets can be used for, including marking a reminder as completed, playing or pausing a song or podcast, and controlling accessories in the Home app, and there will be many more possibilities as third-party apps are updated with support in the coming months.<br/>
<br/>
Home Screen widgets offered limited functionality until now, as Apple did not allow developers to include scrolling, buttons, or animations.<br/>
<br/>
<h3>Improved Autocorrect</h3><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/iOS-17-Autocorrect-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="1080" height="638" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-898562" /><br/>
Apple says iOS 17 includes a state-of-the-art language model for word prediction that will greatly improve autocorrection on the iPhone. When typing, on-device machine learning will intelligently correct mistakes with greater accuracy than ever before. In addition, users will now receive predictive text recommendations inline as they type, allowing for words or complete sentences to be added by tapping the space bar.<br/>
<br/>
Autocorrection has an updated design on iOS 17 that briefly underlines an autocorrected word. Tapping on an underlined word reveals the original word typed, making it easy to quickly revert the change. The system will also learn the user's typing habits over time and avoid some corrections, which Apple's software engineering chief Craig Federighi said is designed for "those moments where you just want to type a ducking word."<br/>
<br/>
<h3>Apple Maps Offline</h3><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/Apple-Maps-Offline.jpg" alt="" width="1324" height="956" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-898866" /><br/>
Apple Maps is catching up on a key Google Maps feature on iOS 17 with the ability to download maps for offline use. Apple says users can download a specific map area and access turn-by-turn navigation, view their estimated time of arrival, find places, and more when an iPhone is not connected to a cellular or Wi-Fi network.<br/>
<br/>
<h3>Stickers Drawer</h3><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/iOS-17-Sticker-Drawer.jpg" alt="" width="2770" height="1628" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-898869" /><br/>
A new stickers drawer on iOS 17 provides access to all stickers, including Live Stickers, emoji, Memoji, and iMessage sticker packs in one place. Live Stickers can be created by touching and holding an object in a photo, such as a cat or a dog.<br/>
<br/>
<h3>"Hey Siri" Shortened to Siri</h3><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/Hey-Siri-vs-Siri.jpeg" alt="" width="1600" height="894" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-898361" /><br/>
Apple has simplified the voice command to invoke Siri on the iPhone and other Apple devices, including the iPad, Mac, HomePod, and newest AirPods Pro. Instead of "Hey Siri," users are now simply able to say "Siri" to activate the voice assistant, and can issue multiple commands in succession without having to say "Siri" again.<br/>

At the time, we said that the removable back glass would likely result in significantly lower repair fees for iPhone 15 Pro models with cracked back glass for customers without AppleCare+ coverage, and this is now confirmed. As noted <a href="https://twitter.com/ianzelbo/status/1703439723400667246">by Ian Zelbo</a>, Apple has <a href="https://support.apple.com/iphone/repair">updated its U.S. website</a> with iPhone 15 repair fees, revealing that it will charge &#36;169 or &#36;199 to repair the iPhone 15 Pro or iPhone 15 Pro Max with back glass damage. By comparison, these fees are set at &#36;499 or &#36;549 for the iPhone 14 Pro or iPhone 14 Pro Max.<br/>
<br/>
The lower fees were also reported <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2023/09/17/replacing-back-glass-iphone-15-pro/">by <em>9to5Mac</em></a>. For customers with AppleCare+ coverage for their iPhone, back glass damage can be repaired for &#36;29.<br/>
<br/>
In the U.S., Apple's battery replacement fee is set at &#36;99 for all four iPhone 15 models, which is unchanged from the iPhone 14 series.

		<description><![CDATA[iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Pro models are capable of up to 27W peak charging speeds with an appropriate USB-C power adapter, according to <a href="https://www.macotakara.jp/iphone/entry-45309.html">Japanese blog <em>Mac Otakara</em></a>. It is unclear where the website sourced this information from, but it seems to confirm that the iPhone 15 Pro models have the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/09/18/iphone-14-and-14-pro-charging-speeds/">same maximum charging speeds as the iPhone 14 Pro models</a>.<br/>
<br/>

In August, <em>9to5Mac</em> reported that at least some iPhone 15 models <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/17/iphone-15-faster-charging-speeds/">could support up to 35W charging speeds</a>, but this rumor appears to be incorrect.<br/>
<br/>
Just like the iPhone 14 models, Apple says all four iPhone 15 models can charge up to 50% in around 30 minutes with a 20W or higher power adapter.<br/>
<br/>
Last year, the website ChargerLAB determined that Apple's <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MY1W2AM/A/30w-usb-c-power-adapter">30W USB-C power adapter</a> was the company's lowest-priced charger that could charge the iPhone 14 Pro models at their maximum charging speeds of up to 27W, and this will likely remain the case for the iPhone 15 Pro models. In the U.S., the adapter is priced at &#36;39 on Apple's online store.<br/>
<br/>
Real-world tests still need to be completed, but for now it appears the 35W rumor was wrong.<br/>
<br/>
All of the new iPhone 15 models launch on Friday, September 22.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/macotakara-jp/">Mac Otakara</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-15-Pro">iPhone 15 Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/17/iphone-15-pro-27w-max-charging-report/">iPhone 15 Pro Models Reportedly Max Out at 27W Charging Speeds Despite 35W Rumor</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-15-pro-models-reportedly-max-out-at-27w-charging-speeds-despite-35w-rumor.2402528/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>
