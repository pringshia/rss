		<description><![CDATA[Apple plans to announce new products with press releases on its website this week, a proven source familiar with the matter told <em>MacRumors</em>. While the products that Apple plans to announce have not been disclosed, there are rumors about new iPads, Macs, and accessories. It is unclear exactly what will be announced this week.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/Apple-Logo-Spotlight.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-912758" /><br/>
<em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman today reiterated that Apple is planning new iPad Pro, iPad Air, and MacBook Air models, along with new Magic Keyboard and Apple Pencil accessories for select iPads. Gurman believes that <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/03/no-apple-event-for-new-ipads-macs-gurman/">Apple is not planning to hold a traditional event</a> to unveil these products, and instead plans to announce them "on its website" and with a "series of online videos and marketing campaigns" at some point in March or April.<br/>
<br/>
The following announcements are expected in this March-April window:<ul><li>Two new iPad Pro models with the M3 chip, OLED displays, a thinner enclosure, a landscape-oriented front camera, a redesigned rear camera bump and other design tweaks, and possibly MagSafe wireless charging</li><br/>
<li>Two new iPad Air models with the M2 chip, including a first-ever 12.9-inch model</li><br/>
<li>A new Magic Keyboard for the iPad Pro with a larger trackpad, a partially-aluminum enclosure, and other design tweaks</li><br/>
<li>At least one new Apple Pencil</li><br/>
<li>New 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Air models with the M3 chip, and the laptops will likely gain support for Wi-Fi 6E and Bluetooth 5.3</li><br/>
<li>A new color option for the iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus has not been definitively rumored, but it is likely based on precedent</li><br/>
<li>New color options for iPhone cases and Apple Watch bands</li></ul>There have also been rumors about <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/01/18/apple-tv-faster-chip-2024-launch/">a new Apple TV</a> and a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/10/homepod-with-7-inch-display-to-launch-in-2024/">HomePod with a screen</a> launching in the first half of 2024, but it is unclear if these products are ready. There are also <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/03/iphone-se-4-design-revealed-in-cad-renders/">alleged CADs for a fourth-generation iPhone SE</a>, but it is likewise unclear if that device is imminent, as 2025 has been a more widely rumored timeframe for it.<br/>
<br/>
If this information from our previously-accurate source proves to be correct, keep an eye on the Apple Newsroom page for announcements this week.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/03/source-apple-product-announcements-this-week/">Source: Apple to Announce New Products This Week</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/source-apple-to-announce-new-products-this-week.2420954/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The rumored design of the fourth-generation <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-se/">iPhone SE</a> was today corroborated in a series of CAD renders shared by Indian tech blog <a href="https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/exclusive-apple-iphone-se-4-cad-renders-new-design/"><em>91Mobiles</em></a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/iPhone-SE-4-render.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="675" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-939241" /><br/>
The images show a 6.1-inch, all-screen design display with a notch housing the TrueDepth camera array for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mask-face-id/">Face ID</a>, flat sides, and a USB-C port in place of Lightning. This design would be a substantial upgrade over the current &zwnj;iPhone SE&zwnj;, which features curved edges, a 4.7-inch display, a Home Button with <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/touch-id/">Touch ID</a>, and large bezels.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/iPhone-SE-4-front-render.jpg" alt="" width="1068" height="529" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-939243" /><br/>
The new &zwnj;iPhone SE&zwnj; is apparently 147mm tall, 71.5mm wide, and 7.7mm thick. This is almost identical to the size of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-14/">iPhone 14</a>, which is 146.7mm tall, 71.5mm wide, and 7.8mm thick.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/iPhone-SE-4-rear-render.jpg" alt="" width="1068" height="529" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-939244" /><br/>
Overall, the images corroborate <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/27/iphone-se-4-details/"><em>MacRumors</em>' reporting from last year</a>, which revealed that the next-generation &zwnj;iPhone SE&zwnj; would largely re-use the design of the &zwnj;iPhone 14&zwnj;, including &zwnj;Face ID&zwnj; authentication and a 6.1-inch OLED display, but with a single rear camera, an Action button, and a USB-C port. The device is expected to launch next year.<br/>
<br/>

<em>91Mobiles</em> previously revealed accurate CAD renders of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/14/iphone-13-pro-thicker-and-larger-rear-camera/">iPhone 13 Pro</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/03/16/iphone-14-pro-cad-renders-no-notch/">iPhone 14 Pro</a>, but its <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/17/apple-watch-series7-cad-larger-display/">Apple Watch Series 7 designs</a> were ultimately incorrect.

		<description><![CDATA[Apple does not plan to hold a traditional event to unveil new iPads and Macs, according to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-03-03/why-was-apple-car-canceled-the-hubris-in-apple-thinking-it-could-outdo-tesla-ltbke5ut"><em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman</a>. Instead, he said Apple plans to announce the products on its website with a "series of online videos and marketing campaigns."<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/iPad-Air-12.9-Inch-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2192" height="1233" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-917813" /><br/>
If this plan is accurate, we can expect the new products to be announced with press releases on the Apple Newsroom website.<br/>
<br/>
Gurman expects Apple to announce the following products:<ul><li>Two new iPad Pro models with the M3 chip and OLED displays</li><br/>
<li>A new Magic Keyboard for the iPad Pro</li><br/>
<li>Two new iPad Air models, including a first-ever 12.9-inch model</li><br/>
<li>At least one new Apple Pencil</li><br/>
<li>New 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Air models with the M3 chip</li></ul>The new iPad Pro models are <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/20/upcoming-oled-ipad-pro-thinner/">expected to be thinner</a>, and they are rumored to be equipped with a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/25/ipad-pro-landscape-face-id-camera/">landscape-oriented front camera</a> like the iPad 10.<br/>
<br/>
March or April are also common months for Apple to release a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/29/iphone-15-productred-possibility/">new iPhone color</a>, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/27/apple-watch-bands-spring-colors/">new colors for iPhone cases and Apple Watch bands</a>.<br/>
<br/>
In terms of timing, Gurman said that Apple is planning to release a "special version" of iOS 17.4 with support for the new hardware at the end of March, leading him to expect the devices to "arrive sometime in March or April." Presumably, there would also be special iPadOS 17.4 and macOS 14.4 versions preinstalled on the new iPads and Macs.<br/>
<br/>
iOS 17.4 includes <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/19/iphone-changes-coming-to-eu-users/">major changes to the App Store and more</a> in the EU, as a result of the Digital Markets Act. Apple has until March 6 to comply with the Digital Markets Act, in order to avoid fines, so the common belief has been that iOS 17.4 will <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/23/ios-17-4-release-date/">likely be released by then</a>. The special version would follow later in the month.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/">iPad Air </a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/">MacBook Air</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPad-Air">iPad Air (Don't Buy)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#11-iPad-Pro">11" iPad Pro (Don't Buy)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#12-9-iPad-Pro">12.9" iPad Pro (Don't Buy)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#15-MacBook-Air">15" MacBook Air (Don't Buy)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Air">13" MacBook Air (Don't Buy)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipad.137">iPad</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macbook-air.122">MacBook Air</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/03/no-apple-event-for-new-ipads-macs-gurman/">Gurman: No Apple Event Planned for Upcoming iPads and Macs</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/gurman-no-apple-event-planned-for-upcoming-ipads-and-macs.2420928/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's former hardware engineering chief Dan Riccio told colleagues he is "nearing retirement" after more than 25 years at the company, according to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-03-03/why-was-apple-car-canceled-the-hubris-in-apple-thinking-it-could-outdo-tesla-ltbke5ut"><em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/Apple-Dan-Riccio.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-939201" /><br/>
John Ternus <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/25/dan-riccio-transitioning-new-project/">succeeded</a> Riccio as Apple's Senior Vice President of Hardware Engineering in 2021. That year, Apple said Riccio would "transition to a new role focusing on a new project," which Gurman said was the Vision Pro headset.<br/>
<br/>
Here is how Apple described Riccio when it announced that transition in 2021:<blockquote>Riccio has been a leader in designing, developing, and engineering almost all of Apple's products. From the first generation iMac to the more recent 5G iPhone lineup, M1-based Macs, and AirPods Max, Riccio built the Hardware Engineering teams and scaled Apple's ability to innovate across multiple new product lines with the highest quality. After joining Apple in 1998 as a leader on the Product Design team, Riccio became vice president of iPad Hardware Engineering in 2010, and in 2012 he joined the executive team as the leader of Hardware Engineering.</blockquote>Here is what Riccio said in that press release:<blockquote>Working at Apple has been the opportunity of a lifetime, spent making the world's best products with the most talented people you could imagine. After 23 years of leading our Product Design or Hardware Engineering teams — culminating with our biggest and most ambitious product year ever — it's the right time for a change. Next up, I'm looking forward to doing what I love most — focusing all my time and energy at Apple on creating something new and wonderful that I couldn't be more excited about.</blockquote>Apple launched the Vision Pro in the U.S. <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/02/apple-vision-pro-launch-day/">in early February</a>, and it said the headset will be released in additional countries later this year.<br/>
<br/>
There is no timeframe for Riccio's retirement, as Gurman said specific details related to his planned departure are still being worked out.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/dan-riccio/">Dan Riccio</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/03/apples-dan-riccio-nearing-retirement-report/">Apple Executive Dan Riccio Reportedly &#039;Nearing Retirement&#039; Following Vision Pro Launch</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-executive-dan-riccio-reportedly-nearing-retirement-following-vision-pro-launch.2420929/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple shocked the world this week by canceling its long-running electric vehicle project into which it invested billions of dollars over the past decade. Rumors indicated the project had been struggling for years, but to see it officially end up on the chopping block is still quite startling.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/top-stories-2mar2024.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-939143" /><br/>
Other news and rumors this week included the pending release of iOS 17.4 and the significant changes for EU users that come along with it, rumors about device support for iOS 18 and iPadOS 18 later this year, and more, so read on below for all the details!<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Apple Cancels Electric Car Project</h2><br/>
Apple this week <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/27/apple-cancels-electric-car-project/">reportedly canceled its long-rumored electric vehicle project</a> after years of setbacks. The report said that some employees on the team will shift to working on generative AI, which is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/16/ios-18-slew-of-new-ai-features/">expected to be a tentpole feature of iOS 18</a>, while others may be laid off.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/12/Apple-car-wheel-icon-feature-teal.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-774148" /><br/>
Following the news, we shared a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-car-history/">detailed recap of the Apple Car's history</a> dating back to the project's inception around 2014, including some of the challenges faced. Dan and Hartley also discussed the developments in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/01/the-macrumors-show-rip-apple-car/">this week's episode of <em>The MacRumors Show</em></a>.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>iOS 17.4 is Coming Soon: Here's Apple's Full Release Notes</h2><br/>
iOS 17.4 includes <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/19/iphone-changes-coming-to-eu-users/">several changes to the App Store</a>, Safari, and more in the EU, as a result of new regulations under the Digital Markets Act.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/iOS-17.4-Feature-Orange.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-932463" /><br/>
For a complete list of other new features and changes coming to the iPhone with iOS 17.4, read <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/27/apple-seeds-ios-17-4-release-candidate/">Apple's full release notes for the update</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Apple is expected to release iOS 17.4 on or before March 6, the deadline for complying with the Digital Markets Act. In advance of the release, Apple has <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/01/apple-whitepaper-alternative-app-marketplaces/">published a deep dive</a> into the steps it has taken to try to keep users safe among the changes, while Spotify, Epic Games, and others have <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/01/spotify-epic-games-apple-dma-complaint/">protested that the changes do not comply</a> with the intent of the act.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>iOS 18 Rumored to Be Compatible With These iPhone Models</h2><br/>
A private X/Twitter account with a proven track record for iOS-related information this week shared alleged <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/29/will-your-iphone-support-ios-18/">iOS 18 and iPadOS 18 compatibility details</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/iOS-18-Roundup-Article.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-924585" /><br/>
We have shared a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/27/ios-18-compatible-iphones-rumor/">full list of iPhone models that are rumored to support iOS 18</a>, as well as a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/27/ipados-18-compatible-ipads-rumor/">full list of iPad models that are rumored to support iPadOS 18</a>. Both software updates are expected to be unveiled at Apple's annual developers conference WWDC in June.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Apple Expands Do-It-Yourself Repair Program to M3 Macs</h2><br/>
Apple this week expanded its self-service repair program in the U.S. and Europe <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/29/apple-self-service-repair-m3-macs/">to support M3 Macs</a>, including the 14-inch MacBook Pro, 16-inch MacBook Pro, and iMac variously equipped with M3, M3 Pro, and M3 Max chips.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/apple-self-service-macbook-1600.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-939134" /><br/>
<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/29/apple-self-service-repair-m3-macs/">Parts, tools, and manuals are now available</a> from Apple for customers who wish to attempt repairing these Macs, but Apple of course still recommends that most customers visit an Apple Store or other authorized repair shop.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>HomePod With 'iPad-Like Display' Rumored to Launch in 2025 at Earliest</h2><br/>
Apple is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/25/homepod-with-ipad-like-screen-2025-rumor/">still working on a new HomePod speaker with an "iPad-like display,"</a> but the device is unlikely to launch until 2025 at the earliest, according to the latest word from <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/04/HomePod-G4-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-793597" /><em>Concept rendering</em></div><br/>
Gurman reiterated that Apple has also explored a device that <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/04/18/apple-work-on-apple-tv-homepod-continues/">combines an Apple TV, HomePod, and FaceTime camera</a>, along with iPad-like smart displays that could be magnetically attached to a wall in a house.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Not-So-FineWoven iPhone Case 'Browning Like a Rotten Banana'</h2><br/>
Apple last year <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/12/apple-announces-finewoven/">stopped selling leather accessories</a>, including iPhone cases. Instead, it introduced a new fabric material called FineWoven.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/finewoven-case-stern.jpeg" alt="" width="3000" height="1999" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-938281" /><br/>
Unfortunately for Apple, the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/26/finewoven-iphone-cases-brown-like-rotten-banana/">FineWoven cases for iPhones have received lots of criticism</a>, with many customers complaining about quality issues after extended usage. <em>The Wall Street Journal</em>'s Joanna Stern said her case is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/26/finewoven-iphone-cases-brown-like-rotten-banana/">"browning like a rotten banana"</a> after just five months.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Goldman Sachs today increased the Apple Card savings account's balance limit to &#36;1 million, with cardholders being notified by email.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/apple-card-savings-account-feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-928948" /><br/>
From the updated <a href="https://www.goldmansachs.com/terms-and-conditions/Deposits-Account-Agreement.pdf">Apple Card cardholder agreement</a>, effective March 1:<blockquote>The maximum balance limit for your Account is &#36;1,000,000, based on your Current Balance (including interest and Daily Cash deposits).</blockquote>The account's previous balance limit was &#36;250,000, which is the maximum amount that the U.S. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) would cover in the event that Goldman Sachs were to become insolvent. Any deposits above &#36;250,000, up to the new &#36;1 million limit, would not be covered by the FDIC in the event of bank failure.<br/>
<br/>
Some other high-yield savings accounts in the U.S. offer balance limits above &#36;250,000. For example, Goldman Sachs' other high-yield savings account Marcus allows a maximum balance of &#36;1 million per account, up to a total of &#36;3 million.<br/>
<br/>
Apple launched its savings account <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/17/apple-card-savings-account-launching-today/">in April 2023</a>, in partnership with Goldman Sachs. The account can be opened and managed in the Wallet app on the iPhone, and it has no fees, no minimum deposits, and no minimum balance requirements. You must have an Apple Card, be a U.S. resident, and be at least 18 years old to open an account.<br/>
<br/>
The account allows Apple Card holders to earn interest on their Daily Cash cashback balance, and on funds deposited via a linked bank account or an Apple Cash balance. Apple's savings account <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/26/apple-savings-account-apy-increase/">currently offers a 4.5% APY</a> following an increase in late January.<br/>
<br/>
To open a savings account in the Wallet app, tap on your Apple Card, tap on the circle with three dots at the top of the screen, tap Daily Cash, and select Set Up Savings.<br/>
<br/>
Goldman Sachs reportedly plans to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/28/apple-goldman-sachs-partnership-ending/">end its partnership with Apple</a>, but it is unclear how this might impact the Apple Card and the savings account.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Spotify, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/epic-games/">Epic Games</a>, Deezer, Paddle, and several other developers and EU associations today <a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2024-03-01/a-letter-to-the-european-commission-on-apples-lack-of-dma-compliance/">sent a joint letter</a> to the European Commission to complain about Apple's "proposed scheme for compliance" with the Digital Markets Act (DMA).<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/App-Store-Unfair-Feature-2.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-939125" /><br/>
The 34 companies and associations do not believe Apple's plans "meet the law's requirements." Apple's changes "disregard both the spirit and letter of the law" and if left unchanged, will "make a mockery of the DMA," according to the letter. Several specific components of Apple's plan are highlighted, including the Core Technology Fee, the Notarization process, and the terms that developers must accept.<br/>
<ul><br/>
 	<li>Apple's requirement to stay with the current <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a> terms or opt in to new terms provides developers with "an unworkable choice" that adds complexity and confusion. The letter suggests that neither option is DMA compliant and would "consolidate Apple's stronghold over digital markets."</li><br/>
 	<li>The Core Technology Fee and transaction fees will hamper competition and will prevent developers from agreeing to the "unjust terms."</li><br/>
 	<li>Apple is using "unfounded privacy and security concerns" to limit user choice. The "scare screens" that Apple plans to show users will "mislead and degrade the user experience."</li><br/>
 	<li>Apple is not allowing sideloading, and it is making the installation and use of new app stores "difficult, risky and financially unattractive for developers."</li><br/>
</ul><br/>
The companies and associations are urging the European Union to take "swift, timely and decisive action against Apple." The way the European Commission responds to Apple's proposal "will serve as a litmus test of the DMA and whether it can deliver for Europe's citizens and economy."<br/>
<br/>
Apple is required to comply with the Digital Markets Act by March 7, and the app ecosystem changes baked are baked in to iOS 17.4. We are expecting to see iOS 17.4 released early next week, and that is when alternative app marketplaces, alternative payment methods, and the new terms that Apple has designed for developers will go into effect.<br/>
<br/>
In support of the changes that it is implementing, Apple today <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/01/apple-whitepaper-alternative-app-marketplaces/">published a whitepaper</a> outlining the risks that it is attempting to mitigate with the Notarization process and other requirements alternative app marketplaces and the apps installed through those marketplaces must submit to.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/spotify/">Spotify</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/european-union/">European Union</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/epic-games/">Epic Games</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/01/spotify-epic-games-apple-dma-complaint/">Spotify, Epic Games, and Others Argue Apple&#039;s App Store Changes Do Not Comply With DMA</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/spotify-epic-games-and-others-argue-apples-app-store-changes-do-not-comply-with-dma.2420823/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today published a whitepaper [<a href="https://developer.apple.com/security/complying-with-the-dma.pdf">PDF</a>] detailing the privacy and security protections that it is implementing in the European Union to keep users as safe as possible while also complying with the requirements of the Digital Markets Act.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/App-Store-vs-EU-Feature-2.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-932826" /><br/>
As a recap, with the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ios-17-4-beta-features/">upcoming iOS 17.4 update</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> users in the European Union will be able to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/25/ios-17-4-alternative-app-marketplaces-eu/">install apps through alternative app marketplaces</a> rather than the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a>. Several companies are working on marketplaces, with <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/29/setapp-alternative/">Setapp</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/16/epic-games-store-ios-eu/">Epic Games</a> confirming plans to offer an &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; alternative.<br/>
<br/>
Apps installed through marketplaces are essentially "sideloaded" and are not subject to the standard &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; review process. In an effort to minimize the risk of malware and fraud, Apple has implemented a Notarization process that app marketplaces and the apps sold through those marketplaces must submit to.<br/>
<br/>
Notarization includes both an automated scan and human review to ensure that apps do not contain malware, function as advertised, and do not engage in "egregious fraud" attempts. An app can't be installed on an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; using sideloading unless it is signed by Apple through Notarization, and Apple is requiring developers to have a Developer account and provide legitimate details like name, address, and phone number. Apps will need to explain why they need access to sensitive data like the microphone, camera, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mask-face-id/">Face ID</a>, health data, and more, and user consent will also be required for these functions to work after an app is installed.<br/>
<br/>
What Notarization won't do is look at the content of apps. Apps installed through alternative marketplaces can have adult content, copyrighted content, drug-related content, and other features that would not be allowed in the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj;. Apple will attempt to stop apps that impersonate other apps or that have undocumented features, but the company warns that sideloaded apps will not be as secure as those installed through the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
Alternative app marketplaces need to adhere to baseline criteria that requires them to commit to monitoring for and removing malicious apps and providing support to users. Refunds, for example, will need to be provided by the app marketplace because marketplaces use alternative payment methods rather than in-app purchases. Alternative payment methods are also accepted in &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; apps under the DMA.<br/>
<br/>
European users who install an app outside of the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; will be presented with an app installation sheet that provides the app name, developer name, app description, screenshots, and ratings. Sheets can be turned off for a marketplace in the Settings app, and they also disappear if a marketplace is set as the default store.<br/>
<br/>
Similar disclosures are also offered up for apps that use alternative payment methods. Apple provides warnings that features like easy subscription cancelation and Ask to Buy are not available, and that there is no protection from predatory pricing.<br/>
<br/>
Apple says that it has received numerous emails from European users and government agencies that are concerned with the risks of alternative app marketplaces, and Apple promises to "work tirelessly" to protect users "to the extent possible under the law." There is no way for users to opt out of the DMA changes, and Apple suggests that some people may have to use alternative apps against their will. Employers and schools may require an app that is only available through a marketplace, for example.<br/>
<br/>
Much of Apple's whitepaper walks through the risks that &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; users will need to contend with and the work that alternative app marketplace operators will need to do in order to keep users safe.<br/>
<br/>
Notably, Apple says that the changes that it is making have been discussed with the European Commission, and there have been no concerns raised. The DMA does recognize the privacy risks associated with alternative app marketplaces, and Apple says it is aiming to do what it can to protect and educate users under the new guidelines.<br/>
<br/>
&zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; owners in the European Union who have additional concerns about alternative app marketplaces can <a href="https://developer.apple.com/security/complying-with-the-dma.pdf">read through Apple's full PDF</a> to get a complete picture of the security and safety protections that Apple has put in place and the risks that still remain.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/european-union/">European Union</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/01/apple-whitepaper-alternative-app-marketplaces/">Apple Does Deep Dive Into Security Protections and Risks With Alternative App Marketplaces</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-does-deep-dive-into-security-protections-and-risks-with-alternative-app-marketplaces.2420813/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Sjq0sTUSQb0?si=fugJH-oY5WYgqqQ5" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe><em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@themacrumorsshow?sub_confirmation=1">Subscribe to The MacRumors Show YouTube channel</a> for more videos</em></div><br/>
Despite Apple's reputation for innovation, the company struggled to achieve the breakthroughs necessary to offer a viable self-driving car. The project's ambitious scope and shifting focus led to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-car-history/">repeated setbacks</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Earlier this week, <em>Bloomberg</em>'s <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a> <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/27/apple-cancels-electric-car-project/">broke the news</a> that Apple has officially canceled its plans to launch a car, informing approximately 2,000 employees working on the project of the decision. Many of the staff working on the car will apparently move to Apple's artificial intelligence division. The company apparently <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/28/apple-car-10-billion-spent/">spent over &#36;10 billion</a> on the project <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-car-history/">over the period of a decade</a>. <br/>
<br/>
We discuss the multifaceted reasons behind the Apple car's cancelation and its implications for the future of the company and the wider automotive industry. We talk through the strategic missteps and missed opportunities that characterized the vehicle's development, such as Apple's failure to secure a partnership with an established automaker or to acquire a company like Tesla.<br/>
<br/>
Our conversation also touches on the competitive dynamics of the automotive industry, such as the reluctance of some automakers to adopt the next-generation <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/carplay/">CarPlay</a> experience. Despite these challenges, the project's cancelation opens new avenues for Apple to reallocate its resources toward  improving its existing product lineup and emerging technologies such as generative AI.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Following intense criticism, Apple <a href="https://developer.apple.com/support/dma-and-apps-in-the-eu">today walked back its plan</a> to disable <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/home-screen/">Home Screen</a> web apps in the European Union starting with iOS 17.4.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/iOS-17.4-Feature-Triad.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-932464" /><br/>
Following the release of the second beta version of iOS 17.4, it emerged that Apple had <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/08/ios-17-4-nerfs-web-apps-in-the-eu/">restricted the functionality of iOS web apps in the EU</a>. Web apps could no longer launch from the &zwnj;Home Screen&zwnj; in their own top-level window that takes up the entire screen, relegating them to a simple shortcut with an option to open within Safari instead.<br/>
<br/>
The move was heavily criticized by groups like <a href="https://open-web-advocacy.org/blog/its-official-apple-kills-web-apps-in-the-eu/">Open Web Advocacy</a>, which <a href="https://letter.open-web-advocacy.org">started a petition</a> in an effort to persuade Apple to reverse the change, and it even <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/26/disabled-web-apps-attract-eu-scrutiny/">caught the attention of the European Commission</a>. Now, Apple has backtracked and says that &zwnj;Home Screen&zwnj; web apps that use WebKit in the EU will continue to function as expected upon the release of iOS 17.4. In an <a href="https://developer.apple.com/support/dma-and-apps-in-the-eu">update posted on Apple's developer website</a>, the company said:<blockquote>Previously, Apple announced plans to remove the Home Screen web apps capability in the EU as part of our efforts to comply with the DMA. The need to remove the capability was informed by the complex security and privacy concerns associated with web apps to support alternative browser engines that would require building a new integration architecture that does not currently exist in iOS.<br/>
<br/>
We have received requests to continue to offer support for Home Screen web apps in iOS, therefore we will continue to offer the existing Home Screen web apps capability in the EU. This support means Home Screen web apps continue to be built directly on WebKit and its security architecture, and align with the security and privacy model for native apps on iOS. <br/>
<br/>
Developers and users who may have been impacted by the removal of Home Screen web apps in the beta release of iOS in the EU can expect the return of the existing functionality for Home Screen web apps with the availability of iOS 17.4 in early March.</blockquote><br/>
<br/>
Apple previously claimed that <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/15/ios-17-4-web-apps-removed-apple/">it had to make the change to how web apps work</a> in iOS to comply with the EU's Digital Markets Act (DMA), arguing that third-party browsers used with web apps in Europe could expose users to unlawful security and privacy risks. It believed that the adjustment would only affect a small number of users. Apple still needs to make a range of changes to its platforms in the European Union, such as allowing third-party app stores, by the DMA's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/19/iphone-changes-coming-to-eu-users/">deadline of March 6</a>.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/european-union/">European Union</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/01/apple-walks-back-decision-to-disable-eu-web-apps/">Apple Walks Back Decision to Disable Home Screen Web Apps in the EU</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-walks-back-decision-to-disable-home-screen-web-apps-in-the-eu.2420805/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-maps/">Apple Maps</a> has been providing navigational guidance to Apple users for almost 13 and a half years now, and much has changed about the app in that time. However, according to data from Canalys, the overwhelming majority of iPhones in the U.S. still have Google Maps downloaded as an alternative to &zwnj;Apple Maps&zwnj;, which comes preinstalled on all iPhones. We want to hear from <em>MacRumors</em> readers. Which do you prefer to get you from A to B?<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/Apple-Maps-vs-Google-Maps-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-939046" /><br/>
Launched in September 2012, &zwnj;Apple Maps&zwnj; was quickly <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2012/09/20/apples-new-ios-6-maps-app-drawing-significant-criticism/">criticized</a> for having incomplete and inaccurate mapping data, which led some <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> users on dangerous routes. Apple CEO <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tim-cook/">Tim Cook</a> offered a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2012/09/28/tim-cook-publishes-open-letter-on-maps-for-ios-6/">rare public apology</a> for the frustration it caused customers, and iOS chief Scott Forstall was <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2012/10/29/scott-forstall-reportedly-forced-out-of-apple/">ousted</a> just one month later.<br/>
<br/>
Since then, Apple has made significant improvements to &zwnj;Apple Maps&zwnj;, building in new features and correcting lingering errors. Real-time traffic information and navigation options for pedestrians were added to Maps in 2013, which is also the same year Maps was extended to OS X. In 2015, Maps was updated with "Nearby," a feature that offers up local points of interest and transit directions in a handful of cities.<br/>
<br/>
In early 2020, Apple completed an overhaul of its maps in the United States, adding significantly greater detail including updated buildings, parks, sports fields, pools, and more. A Look Around feature in select cities is similar to Google's Street View, and the updated maps have been rolling out to more countries in the time since. In iOS 15, Apple introduced immersive walking directions shown in augmented reality, curated guides for select cities, real-time transit updates, and more road details for enhanced driving navigation. In iOS 16 it gained multi-stop routing. And in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a>, Apple made it possible to download maps for offline use – something Google Maps users have been able to do for quite some time.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/Apple_Apple-Maps_New-Ways_09272021_big.jpg.large_2x.jpg" alt="" width="1960" height="1290" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-939053" /><br/>
Have Apple's incremental improvements been enough for it to be considered an equal to Google Maps in users' eyes? Of course, Google developers have not stood idly by watching &zwnj;Apple Maps&zwnj;' gradual evolution. Google has introduced several enhancements aimed at enriching the user experience through advanced AI technology and more immersive visualization tools, and has even taken a leaf or two out of Apple's book.<br/>
<br/>
One notable recent update in this regard is the Immersive View for Routes, which provides a comprehensive preview of a user's journey, whether they are driving, walking, or cycling. Launched last year, the tool combines billions of Street View and aerial images to create an intricate digital representation of the world, allowing users to visually navigate through bike lanes, sidewalks, intersections, and parking spaces along their route. It also includes a dynamic time slider indicating how conditions such as air quality and weather change throughout the day, helping users plan their trips with more precision.<br/>
<br/>
Another significant improvement is the integration of Lens in Maps, an evolution of the Search with Live View feature. Leveraging AI and augmented reality, Lens in Maps helps users get their bearings in a new location by providing information about nearby amenities like ATMs, transit stations, and dining options. The feature has since been expanded to over 50 cities.<br/>
<br/>
Google Maps has also rolled out updates to make navigation maps more reflective of real-world conditions. These include more detailed and realistic representations of buildings and improved lane guidance on highways. For electric vehicle owners, Google Maps also offers information on charging stations, including compatibility details, charger speed, and the last usage time.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/google-maps-immersive-view.jpg" alt="" width="1060" height="666" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-939059" /><br/>
Despite these concurrent improvements to Google Maps, their combined effect hasn't stopped users coming away impressed by how far Apple's navigational guidance has come. Based on anecdotal reports, the app is increasingly recommended by users for its cleaner view versus the more cluttered design of Google Maps.<br/>
<br/>
Likely thanks to its disastrous launch, &zwnj;Apple Maps&zwnj; still gets a bad rap among some users, but Apple's continued efforts to improve the app appear to have helped reverse some of those opinions. "Maps has come a long way, and people have noticed," Craig Federighi, Apple's head of software, said at WWDC 2023. Are you more or less likely to use &zwnj;Apple Maps&zwnj; these days?

This is not the first time that Apple has added movies from other studios to its video streaming service, but it does seem to be the biggest single addition of a collection of classic movies. The entire <a href="https://tv.apple.com/us/collection/limited-time-great-movies-on-apple-tv/edt.col.65de7e7a-b668-4e8f-97ba-20be203b91e9">"Great Movies on Apple TV+" collection</a> is available for a limited time for subscribers in the United States only.<br/>
<br/>
Ridley Scott's historical action epic "Napoleon" is also <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/19/napoleon-apple-tv-plus-march-1/">now streaming</a> on &zwnj;Apple TV+&zwnj; following its run in theatres.

		<description><![CDATA[The chip details of 16 new Apple devices have been discovered, according to technical information posted on X earlier today by a private account with a proven track record of sharing accurate information about Apple's plans.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/10/Apple-Silicon-Teal-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-767478" /><br/>
Eight unreleased Apple devices with the A14 Bionic, A17 Pro, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m2/">M2</a> chips were among the list of chip identifiers (CPIDs). There are two upcoming A14 Bionic and A17 Pro devices, and four upcoming &zwnj;M2&zwnj; devices. <em>MacRumors</em> believes they relate to the following products:<br/>
<br/>
<ul><br/>
<li><strong>A14 Bionic</strong>: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> (11th-generation) in Wi-Fi and Wi-Fi + Cellular configurations. The model number does not correlate to what the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; (11th-generation) is expected to have, so it may be a modified &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; (10th-generation) in Wi-Fi and Wi-Fi + Cellular configurations instead, or potentially a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod/">HomePod</a> with a display.</li><br/>
<li><strong>A17</strong>: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-mini/">iPad mini</a> (seventh-generation) in Wi-Fi and Wi-Fi + Cellular configurations. This may be the A17 Pro chip or an A17 variant.</li><br/>
<li><strong>M2</strong>: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/">iPad Air</a> (sixth-generation) in 10.9- and 12.9-inch display sizes and in Wi-Fi and Wi-Fi + Cellular configurations.</li><br/>
</ul><br/>
<br/>
If they relate to a new entry-level &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; model, the chip identifiers suggest that the device will not receive a chip upgrade in its next incarnation. The current, 10th-generation &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; already contains an A14 Bionic chip. The chances of this device being a &zwnj;HomePod&zwnj; with a display are slim due to model number trends, but the possibility cannot be ruled out.<br/>
<br/>
The current, sixth-generation &zwnj;iPad mini&zwnj; model contains the A15 Bionic and some previous speculation suggested that the device would be most likely to feature the A16 Bionic in its next generation, so an A17 chipset would be a significant upgrade. <br/>
<br/>
There were also eight more identifiers for two unreleased chips that likely relate to the four models in the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a> lineup and the next-generation <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a> in 11- and 13-inch display sizes. The next-generation &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; is widely rumored to launch later this month and feature the M3 chip that Apple first introduced in October 2023. However, the sequence of identifiers raises the unexpected possibility of the &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; containing the M4 chip.<br/>
<br/>
The information suggests that the entire &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; lineup will feature the same A18 chip, corroborating <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/27/iphone-16-lineup-a18-a18-pro-chips-analyst-says/">previous reports</a>. The source who posted the information told <em>MacRumors</em> that the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/">iPhone 16 Pro</a> and &zwnj;iPhone 16 Pro&zwnj; Max will still likely feature a chip branded as an "A18 Pro," even though the entire lineup of chips features the same CPID. The standard "A18" chip in the &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; Plus may have some binned or disabled modules to differentiate it.<br/>
<br/>
Earlier this week, the source posted which <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/27/ios-18-compatible-iphones-rumor/">iPhone</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/27/ipados-18-compatible-ipads-rumor/">iPad</a> models will be supported by <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a>. The account prefers to keep a low profile, but much of its previously posted information and many of its claims have been proven to be true.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/">iPad Air </a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-mini/">iPad mini</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/">iPhone 16 Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-silicon/">Apple Silicon</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPad">iPad (Caution)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPad-Air">iPad Air (Don't Buy)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#11-iPad-Pro">11" iPad Pro (Don't Buy)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#12-9-iPad-Pro">12.9" iPad Pro (Don't Buy)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPad_Mini">iPad Mini (Don't Buy)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipad.137">iPad</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/01/chip-details-of-16-upcoming-apple-devices-revealed/">Chip Details of 16 Upcoming Apple Devices Revealed</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/chip-details-of-16-upcoming-apple-devices-revealed.2420792/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Earlier this week, Apple supplier ams OSRAM announced it would "re-assess its microLED strategy" after a "cornerstone project" was "unexpectedly cancelled." Counterpoint Research's Display Supply Chain Consultants informed <em>MacRumors</em> that this project <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/29/microled-apple-watch-ultra-canceled-for-now/">related to the rumored Apple Watch with a microLED display</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/Apple-Watch-Ultra-2-hero-feature-white.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-911671" /><br/>
Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo today <a href="https://twitter.com/mingchikuo/status/1763552745280426119">commented</a> on the matter, saying that Apple has indeed canceled the project for the "foreseeable future." The analyst said that microLED production costs are currently "too high" for the project to be "economically viable."<br/>
<br/>
"My latest survey indicates that Apple has canceled the Micro LED Apple Watch projects because Apple thinks that Micro LED can't add significant value to this product, and the production costs are too high to make it economically viable," said Kuo.<br/>
<br/>
ams OSRAM was Apple's exclusive LED chip supplier for the project at the time it was canceled, according to Kuo. Apple has "no plans" to mass-produce microLED devices for the "foreseeable future," the analyst said.<br/>
<br/>
Kuo described the cancellation as a "major setback" for Apple, and he said many employees involved with microLED development have been laid off.<br/>
<br/>
While the project may be shelved for now, Apple likely still hopes to eventually transition to microLED technology in the future. Taiwanese research firm <a href="https://www.trendforce.com/presscenter/news/20240301-12054.html">TrendForce today said</a> that while ams OSRAM was Apple's "sole chip supplier" for the Apple Watch Ultra project, Taiwan and South Korea have a "robust lineup of manufacturers for Micro LED chips, backplanes, and related transfer processes," so there are other suppliers that Apple could partner with in the future. In any case, it appears that Apple's first microLED device is several years away.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch-ultra/">Apple Watch Ultra 2</a></div><div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/">Ming-Chi Kuo</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/trendforce/">TrendForce</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/microled-apple-watch/">microLED Apple Watch</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch_Ultra">Apple Watch Ultra (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-watch.172">Apple Watch</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/01/kuo-says-microled-apple-watch-ultra-canceled/">Kuo: Apple Watch Ultra With MicroLED Display Indeed Canceled</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/kuo-apple-watch-ultra-with-microled-display-indeed-canceled.2420791/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Google has <a href="https://blog.google/products/chrome/google-chrome-update-february-2024/">announced</a> a trio of new Chrome browser features for desktop and mobile that aim to provide more helpful suggestions when searching the web, even over poor data connections.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/06/Chrome-Feature-22.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-851161" /><br/>
On desktop, users who are signed into Chrome and open a new tab will now see suggestions in the search field related to their previous searches based on similar things others are looking for. For example, if you recently searched for "Japchae," you might see suggestions for other popular Korean dishes.<br/>
<br/>
Elsewhere, Google says it has also improved image results. Previously, Chrome only displayed images for search suggestions in the address bar that matched a specific product users were looking for. Now on iOS and Android, Chrome will show images for broader shopping categories and products based on simple searches. <br/>
<br/>
Lastly, Chrome on Android and iOS now has improved on-device capabilities that will give users search suggestions even when they have a poor network conntection. Google claims this will also mean more helpful suggestions when Incognito Mode is enabled.<br/>
<br/>
Google says the three new features are now gradually being rolled out to Chrome users. The changes follow last week's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/22/google-chrome-mac-help-me-write-ai/">launch</a> of a new generative AI-based "Help me Write" feature that is available for Chrome browser for desktops.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/google/">Google</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/chrome/">Chrome</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/01/google-chrome-new-web-search-features/">Google Boosts Chrome&#039;s Web Search Suggestions on Mobile and Desktop</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/google-boosts-chromes-web-search-suggestions-on-mobile-and-desktop.2420784/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple will this month release iOS 17.4, its biggest iPhone software update of the year so far, featuring a number of features and changes that users have been anticipating for quite a while.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/iOS-17.4-Everything-New-Your-iPhone-Can-Do-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-938472" /><br/>
Below, we've listed 10 new things that your iPhone will be able to do after you've installed the update, which is projected to arrive by March 7. When the day arrives, be sure to check Settings ➝ General ➝ Software Update on your device to get downloading.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>1. Generate Podcast Transcripts</h2><br/>
Apple is adding <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/view-search-transcripts-podcasts-app/">audio transcripts to the Podcasts app</a> for iPhone, meaning you'll be able to read along to your favorite podcasts as they are spoken. If you're familiar with lyrics in Apple Music, it's very similar.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/podcast-app-transcript.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-932875" /><br/>
You can also search the auto-generated podcast transcripts for specific words or phrases and jump to that point in the conversation, where you can then tap to skip to the audio track.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>2. Protect Messages Against Quantum Attacks</h2><br/>
Apple is bringing a new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/23/ios-17-4-adds-groundbreaking-imessage-feature/">cryptographic security feature</a> to iMessage called PQ3. This "groundbreaking" and "state-of-the-art" protocol provides "extensive defenses against even highly sophisticated quantum attacks," according to Apple. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/07/General-Apps-Messages.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1407" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-808613" /><br/>
Apple's iMessage service already supports end-to-end encryption, but Apple recognizes that existing cryptographic protocols used by messaging apps rely on mathematical problems that could potentially be solved by future quantum computers. The PQ3 protocol is Apple's solution to mitigate that risk.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>3. Support for Next-Generation CarPlay</h2><br/>
<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/25/ios-17-4-next-generation-carplay/">Next-generation CarPlay</a> is set to launch in the U.S. later in 2024, and iOS 17.4 brings support for a slew of new apps, including climate control, tire pressure, rear-view camera feed, electric vehicle charging status, and more.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/Apple-CarPlay-Dash.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-934995" /><br/>
When Apple first announced next-generation CarPlay, it said committed automakers included Acura, Audi, Ford, Honda, Infiniti, Jaguar, Land Rover, Lincoln, Mercedes-Benz, Nissan, Polestar, Porsche, Renault, and Volvo. Apple has not yet said if any next-generation CarPlay features will be made available in vehicles with classic CarPlay support. <br/>
<br/>
<h2>4. Siri Reads Incoming Messages in Other Languages</h2><br/>
Previously in iOS 17, ‌Siri‌'s interaction with Messages was limited to one option – the ability for ‌Siri‌ to automatically send your dictated messages without asking you to confirm them first.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/ios-17-4-messaging-with-siri.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-932819" /><br/>
In iOS 17.4, however, ‌Siri‌ can also <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/siri-read-messages-another-language/">read messages to you in another language</a> different to the primary language that ‌Siri‌ listens to and responds in. It's a neat option to have if you are bilingual, for example, or you're learning a new language.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>5. Stolen Device Protection Away From Home</h2><br/>
To make it harder for a thief to access passcode-protected data on a stolen iPhone, Apple in iOS 17.3 included Stolen Device Protection. With the feature enabled, Face ID or Touch ID is required to access passwords in iCloud Keychain, Lost Mode settings, options for erasing the device, and making purchases in Safari.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/ios-17-4-stolen-device-protection.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-932874" /><br/>
In addition to the new biometric requirements, the feature also imposes a one-hour security delay on actions like changing an Apple ID password. New in iOS 17.4 is a supplemental option that only requires a security delay when your device is located <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/enable-stolen-device-protection/">away from familiar locations</a>, such as your home or office.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>6. Live Activity for Stopwatch</h2><br/>
For some reason, Apple previously never offered Live Activity support for when you start a stopwatch in the Clock app, until now.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/ios-17-4-stopwatch.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-933379" /><br/>
In iOS 17.4, any running Stopwatch now shows up in the Dynamic Island and on the Lock Screen, where there are controls for pausing the Stopwatch, clearing it, and starting a new lap.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>7. Generate Apple Cash Virtual Card Numbers</h2><br/>
iPhone owners running iOS 17.4 will be able to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/12/ios-17-4-beta-apple-cash-virtual-number/">generate a virtual card number</a> for spending Apple Cash when Apple Pay isn't an online option.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/apple-cash-virtual-card-number.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-935966" /><br/>
An Apple Cash pre-paid card allows users to send peer-to-peer Apple Pay payments to friends and family, transfer money to bank accounts, pay off their Apple Card, or spend money online via Apple Pay. With the new virtual card feature, Apple Cash users will be able to spend their balance even if Apple Pay is not supported by an online store.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>8. App Support for Cloud Gaming Services</h2><br/>
With iOS 17.4, streaming game apps will finally be allowed on the ‌App Store‌ worldwide, which means services like Xbox Cloud Gaming and Nvidia GeForce NOW can be offered as standalone ‌iPhone‌ and ‌iPad‌ apps.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/06/xbox-cloud-gaming-thumb.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-806504" /><br/>
Apple previously only allowed cloud gaming services to be offered via the web, but dedicated apps that let users stream games from servers will soon be permitted. Mini-app, mini-games, chatbots, and plug-ins will also be able to use the in-app purchase system.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>9. Set a Contactless Payment Provider</h2><br/>
In iOS 17.4, third-party payment applications and banks can utilize the NFC chip in iPhones to enable contactless payments directly through the device in the European Economic Area, bypassing the need for Apple Pay or the Wallet app. Users in this region will have the ability to choose a primary contactless payment service, which is triggered at payment terminals or by double-pressing the iPhone's Side button.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2019/11/apple-pay-contactless-terminal.jpg" alt="" width="1064" height="499" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-718443" /><br/>
Within the EU, the Settings app will allow users to select and manage their preferred contactless payment provider. This area also lists all apps that have been authorized for contactless payment functionality. Additionally, users in the EU will have the option to replace the default Wallet application on their iPhones.<br/>
<br/>
