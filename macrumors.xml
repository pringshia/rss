		<description><![CDATA[Apple today released iOS 17.3, iPadOS 17.3, tvOS 17.3, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sonoma/">macOS Sonoma</a> 14.3, and it's a good idea to update as soon as possible to the new operating systems because the software patches an actively exploited vulnerability.<br/>
<br/>

The updates fix a bug in WebKit that could allow maliciously crafted content to lead to arbitrary code execution. Apple says on its <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT214059">security support page</a> that it is aware of a report that the issue may have been exploited.<br/>
<br/>
Apple's software releases also address several other security vulnerabilities that were not known to have been used in the wild. iOS 17.3, for example, fixes bugs with the Neural Engine, kernel, Mail, Safari, Shortcuts, and more.<br/>
<br/>
Details on all of the security fixes for each update can be found on Apple's <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201222">security support site</a>.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-17/">iPadOS 17</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-17.241">iOS 17</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-17.242">iPadOS 17</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macos-ventura.239">macOS Ventura</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/22/ios-17-3-webkit-vulnerability-patch/">iOS 17.3 and macOS Sonoma 14.3 Patch WebKit Vulnerability That May Have Been Exploited</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-17-3-and-macos-sonoma-14-3-patch-webkit-vulnerability-that-may-have-been-exploited.2417120/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today released iOS 17.3 and iPadOS 17.3, the third major updates to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-17/">iPadOS 17</a> operating system updates that initially came out in September 2023. The software comes more than a month after Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/11/apple-releases-ios-17-2-and-ipados-17-2/">released iOS 17.2 and iPadOS 17.2</a> with the Journal app.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xUIzfDkQqqo" title="iOS 17.3 Out Now - Everything New!" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe><em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/macrumors?sub_confirmation=1">Subscribe to the MacRumors YouTube channel</a> for more videos.</em></div><br/>
iOS 17.3 and iPadOS 17.3 can be downloaded on eligible iPhones and iPads over-the-air by going to Settings > General > Software Update. Apple has also released iOS 15.8.1 and iOS 16.7.5 for those running older versions of iOS.<br/>
<br/>
With iOS 17.3, Apple is adding Stolen Device Protection to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>, limiting access to private information just in case someone gets ahold of both your &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; and your passcode. It requires biometric authentication to do things like access passwords, turn off Lost Mode, make purchases in Safari, and more.<br/>
<br/>
The update also includes support for AirPlaying content directly to some hotel room TVs, creating collaborative <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/">Apple Music</a> playlists with friends and family, and more. Apple's full release notes for the update are below.<br/>
<blockquote><b>Stolen Device Protection</b><br/>
- Stolen Device Protection increases security of iPhone and Apple ID by requiring Face ID or Touch ID with no passcode fallback to perform certain actions<br/>
- Security Delay requires Face ID or Touch ID, an hour wait, and then an additional successful biometric authentication before sensitive operations like changing device passcode or Apple ID password can be performed<br/>
<br/>
<b>Lock Screen</b><br/>
- New Unity wallpaper honors Black history and culture in celebration of Black History Month<br/>
<br/>
<b>Music</b><br/>
- Collaborate on playlists allows you to invite friends to join your playlist and everyone can add, reorder, and remove songs<br/>
- Emoji reactions can be added to any track in a collaborative playlist<br/>
<br/>
<b>This update also includes the following improvements:</b><br/>
- AirPlay hotel support lets you stream content directly to the TV in your room in select hotels<br/>
- AppleCare &amp; Warranty in Settings shows your coverage for all devices signed in with your Apple ID<br/>
- Crash detection optimizations (all iPhone 14 and iPhone 15 models)</blockquote><br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today released tvOS 17.3, the third major update to the tvOS 17 operating system that came out last September. tvOS 17.3 comes over a month after tvOS 17.2, an update that brought the revamped <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a> app.<br/>
<br/>

tvOS 17.3 can be downloaded using the Settings app on the ‌&zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj;‌. Go to System &gt; Software Update to get the new software. ‌&zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj;‌ owners who have automatic software updates activated will be upgraded to tvOS 17.3 automatically.<br/>
<br/>
tvOS updates are typically minor in scale compared to other operating system updates, focusing primarily on bug fixes and smaller improvements rather than notable outward-facing changes. No new features were found in the tvOS 17.3 beta testing process.<br/>
<br/>

Today's update comes over a month after the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/11/apple-releases-homepod-17-2/">release of the HomePod 17.2 update</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Apple does not specify what's included in the &zwnj;HomePod&zwnj; 17.3 software, and the generic release notes only say that it brings stability and performance improvements. <br/>
<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today posted an ad specifically focused on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a> Plus, the larger version of the standard &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; model. In the spot, Apple focuses on the battery life of the device, which is equipped with a higher capacity battery than the &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; due to its larger size.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe title="iPhone 15 Plus Battery One More Apple" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Tcwtq9NrVd4" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div><br/>
In the humorous ad, a man takes a video of a child who is attempting to break a wood plank with his hand. The attempts are unsuccessful well into the night, and the &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; Plus battery is able to record for hours. "Battery goes on and on," reads the tagline at the end of the video.<br/>
<br/>
This is in fact the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/24/iphone-15-plus-battery-life-ad/">second iPhone 15 Plus battery ad</a> that Apple has uploaded in recent months. The first spot featured a sad receptacle that was missing being able to charge the &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; Plus.<br/>
<br/>
According to Apple's technical specifications page, the &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; Plus is able to provide up to 26 hours of offline video playback and 100 hours of audio playback.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-ads/">Apple Ads</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/22/iphone-15-plus-battery-ad/">Latest Apple Ad Highlights iPhone 15 Plus Battery</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/latest-apple-ad-highlights-iphone-15-plus-battery.2417102/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

Apple has three other stores in Sweden, but one will be permanently closing eventually. In a statement shared <a href="https://feber.se/mac/apple-kommer-oppna-i-mall-of-scandinavia/461372/">with Swedish publication <em>Feber</em></a> last week, Apple said it will not be renewing its lease for its <a href="https://www.apple.com/se/retail/valacentrum/">Väla Centrum store</a> in Ödåkra, Sweden. Apple has yet to disclose an exact closure date for that location.<br/>
<br/>
This news comes after Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/08/apple-store-hongdae-special-wallpaper/">opened a new store in Seoul, South Korea</a>, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/20/two-apple-stores-permanently-close-today/">permanently closed its Infinite Loop and Royal Hawaiian stores</a>, all on January 20.<br/>
<br/>
Apple operates 528 retail stores worldwide as of today.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-store/">Apple Store</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/22/new-apple-store-opening-in-sweden/">Apple Opening New Store in Sweden, But Permanently Closing Another</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-opening-new-store-in-sweden-but-permanently-closing-another.2417100/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple Music Classical was updated today with what appeared to be CarPlay support, but this was quickly reversed in a follow-up update.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/Apple-Music-Classical-Carplay-Feature-2-1.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-932168" /><br/>
Apple Music Classical showed up on CarPlay starting with version 1.2 today, but support was removed in version 1.2.1 just hours later, after the app failed to load when opened on CarPlay. It's unclear if or when CarPlay support will return.<br/>
<br/>
Apple Music Classical <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/27/apple-music-classical-begins-rolling-out/">first launched in March 2023</a>, offering users with a standard Apple Music subscription access to over five million classical music tracks at no additional cost. The streaming app features advanced search functionality, exclusive artwork, extensive metadata, curated listening recommendations, and more. <br/>
<br/>
The app is available on the iPhone, iPad, and Android devices. It is built upon Primephonic, a classical music streaming service <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/30/apple-acquires-primephonic-classical-music-service/">acquired by Apple in 2021</a>.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple sold between 160,000 and 180,000 Vision Pro headsets during its first pre-order weekend, according to Apple analyst <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/">Ming-Chi Kuo</a>. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/Apple-Vision-Pro-Dual-Loop-Band-Orange-Feature-2.jpg" alt="" width="1960" height="1102" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-929937" /><br/>
In a new <a href="https://medium.com/@mingchikuo/vision-pro首週末預購檢視-符合預期但隱憂浮現-vision-pros-first-weekend-pre-order-review-expectations-in-line-0450c1effe66">post on Medium</a>, Kuo said that the headset sold out soon after the pre-order process opened, with shipping times for all models <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/19/vision-pro-delivery-dates-slip/">slipping by five to seven weeks</a>. While the instant sell-out and extended shipping times appear to be positive at first glance, Kuo cautioned that shipping dates remain unchanged 48 hours after pre-orders opened, indicating that demand may be quickly tapering off after core enthusiasts placed their orders.<br/>
<br/>
For comparison, new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> models similarly sell out soon after pre-orders open, but they usually continue to see a steady increase in shipping dates in the following days, indicating ongoing demand. Kuo believes that shipping 500,000 Vision Pro units this year "should not be challenging," but demand is a key question as "Vision Pro is still a very niche product."<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/">Ming-Chi Kuo</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AppleVisionPro">Vision Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-vision-pro.209">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/22/apple-already-sold-up-to-180000-vision-pros/">Kuo: Apple Has Already Sold Up to 180,000 Vision Pro Headsets</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/kuo-apple-has-already-sold-up-to-180-000-vision-pro-headsets.2417074/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Ahead of the Apple Vision Pro launching <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/19/apple-vision-pro-now-available-for-pre-order/">on February 2</a>, developers are in the process of preparing their apps for the mixed reality headset. So far, over 250 apps with native support for visionOS have been submitted to Apple, according to a source.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/Box-Vision-Pro.jpeg" alt="" width="2160" height="1215" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-932100" /><div class="center-wrap"><em>Box</em></div><br/>
By natively supporting visionOS, apps can take full advantage of "spatial" design elements and offer more immersive features.<br/>
<br/>
In addition to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/19/vision-pro-pre-installed-apps/">some Apple apps</a>, well-known third-party apps that will natively support visionOS at launch include Airmail, Box, CARROT Weather, Fantastical, Facades, JigSpace, MUBI, Night Sky, OmniPlan 4, Parcel, PCalc, Red Bull TV, Sky Guide, Tides, Webex, Zoom, and more, according to data compiled by <a href="https://appfigures.com/">app analytics firm Appfigures</a>.<br/>
<br/>

Microsoft will offer a variety of native visionOS apps at launch, such as Excel, PowerPoint, Word, and Teams, based on App Store marketing images shared by developer <a href="https://mastodon.social/@stroughtonsmith">Steve Troughton-Smith on Mastodon</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/M1Astra">@M1Astra on X/Twitter</a>. Additional images show native apps for Crunchyroll, J.Crew, LEGO Builder's Journey, Lowe's, and others.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/Microsoft-PowerPoint-Vision-Pro.jpeg" alt="" width="3840" height="2160" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-932103" /><div class="center-wrap"><em>Microsoft PowerPoint</em></div><br/>
<br/>

In addition to native apps, iPhone and iPad apps will automatically be available on the Vision Pro, unless a developer <a href="https://developer.apple.com/help/app-store-connect/manage-your-apps-availability/manage-availability-of-iphone-and-ipad-apps-on-apple-vision-pro">opts out</a> using the App Store Connect tool. As a result, Apple says more than one million apps will be available for the headset at launch.<br/>
<br/>
Apple last week listed some additional <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/16/vision-pro-streaming-services-and-sports-apps/">entertainment apps that will be available</a> on the Vision Pro at launch, including Disney+, ESPN, NBA, MLB, PGA Tour, Max, Discovery+, Amazon Prime Video, Paramount+, Peacock, Pluto TV, Tubi, Fubo, IMAX, and TikTok. Some of the apps will be native, while others will be compatible iPad apps.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/Disney-Plus-Vision-Pro-1.jpg" alt="" width="1960" height="1102" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-930910" /><div class="center-wrap"><em>Disney+</em></div><br/>
Disney+ will natively support the Vision Pro at launch, and its app will offer users a selection of 3D movies to watch on the headset, such as <em>Avatar: The Way of Water</em>, <em>Avengers: Endgame</em>, <em>Star Wars: The Force Awakens</em>, <em>Elemental</em>, and <em>Encanto</em>.<br/>
<br/>
"At launch, viewers can transform their space into one of four Disney+ environments, bringing them even closer to the story," said Disney, in a <a href="https://thewaltdisneycompany.com/disney-on-apple-vision-pro-ushers-in-a-new-era-of-storytelling-innovation-and-immersive-entertainment/">press release</a> last week. "Each environment includes animations and sounds that make the space feel alive, and Easter eggs from films and franchises that will surprise and delight fans."<br/>
<br/>
Some popular apps will not offer Vision Pro apps of any kind at launch, including Netflix, Spotify, and YouTube, according to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-01-18/youtube-and-spotify-join-netflix-in-not-launching-apple-vision-pro-apps"><em>Bloomberg</em></a>, but users can still access these services via Safari. It's also unclear if Meta-owned apps such as Facebook, Instagram, Threads, and WhatsApp will be available on the headset at launch.<br/>
<br/>
With around two weeks remaining until the Vision Pro launches, there is still time for developers to prepare their apps, so expect more to follow soon.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/visionos/">visionOS</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AppleVisionPro">Vision Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-vision-pro.209">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/21/apple-vision-pro-third-party-apps/">These Third-Party Apps Are Optimized For Apple Vision Pro So Far</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/these-third-party-apps-are-optimized-for-apple-vision-pro-so-far.2417048/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple plans to release new iPad Air, iPad Pro, and MacBook Air models in the spring this year, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-01-21/apple-vision-pro-lack-of-netflix-youtube-app-store-tensions-threaten-device-lrnjwjb3">according to <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman</a>. Based on this timeframe, the devices could be released as early as this March or April. After the devices are released, he said attention will shift to Apple's annual developers conference WWDC in June.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/iPad-Air-12.9-Inch-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2192" height="1233" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-917813" /><br/>
Below, we outline rumored features and expectations for these upcoming devices.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>iPad Air</h2><br/>
The next iPad Air is expected to be available with 10.9-inch and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/10/12-9-inch-ipad-air-display-shipments/">12.9-inch display sizes</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Rumored and/or likely features for the next iPad Air models include Apple's M2 chip for faster performance, a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/20/next-gen-ipad-air-with-12-9-inch-display-and-redesigned-camera-unit-revealed-in-cad-renders/">redesigned rear camera bump</a>, Wi-Fi 6E support, and Bluetooth 5.3. No major external design changes are expected.<br/>
<br/>
The current fifth-generation iPad Air with the M1 chip was released in March 2022.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>iPad Pro</h2><br/>
The next 11-inch and 13-inch iPad Pro models are widely expected to be the first iPads equipped <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/16/oled-ipad-displays-enter-production/">with OLED displays</a>.<br/>
<br/>
OLED technology would enable the next iPad Pro displays to offer increased brightness, higher contrast ratio, lower power consumption, and other benefits compared to existing models with LCD panels. Apple already uses OLED displays for the latest iPhone and Apple Watch models, excluding the lower-end iPhone SE.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/M3-iPad-Feature-3.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-917548" /><br/>
Due to the switch to OLED, the next iPad Pro models are expected to be more expensive.<br/>
<br/>
iPad Pro models released in 2017 and later support ProMotion, allowing for a variable refresh rate between 24Hz and 120Hz. The switch to OLED would likely allow for the refresh rate to drop down even further to 10Hz or lower to save battery life. iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro models can reach as low as 1Hz while in always-on display mode.<br/>
<br/>
Other rumored and/or likely features for the next iPad Pro models include Apple's latest M3 chip for faster performance, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/18/ipad-pro-magsafe-charging/">MagSafe wireless charging</a>, and a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/03/gurman-new-ipad-magic-keyboard-to-feature-aluminum/">redesigned Magic Keyboard</a> with a larger trackpad and an aluminum top casing. As with the iPad Air, changes to the rear camera bump are also possible for the iPad Pro.<br/>
<br/>
The current iPad Pro models with the M2 chip were released in October 2022.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>MacBook Air</h2><br/>
Gurman said Apple plans to release multiple MacBook Airs with the M3 chip in the spring, so it sounds like the next 13-inch and 15-inch models will be released simultaneously this year, rather than separately like in the past.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/15inch-macbook-air-purple.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-916649" /><br/>
With the M3 chip, the next MacBook Air models will gain hardware-accelerated ray tracing and mesh shading for improved graphics rendering in games, including more accurate lighting, reflections, and shadows. Apple already updated the 14-inch MacBook Pro, 16-inch MacBook Pro, and 24-inch iMac with the M3 chip last year.<br/>
<br/>
No major design changes are expected for the MacBook Air this year, but the laptop will likely gain support for Wi-Fi 6E like other Macs.<br/>
<br/>
Apple last updated the 13-inch MacBook Air in July 2022, while the first-ever 15-inch MacBook Air was released in June 2023.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/">iPad Air </a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/">MacBook Air</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPad-Air">iPad Air (Don't Buy)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#11-iPad-Pro">11" iPad Pro (Don't Buy)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#12-9-iPad-Pro">12.9" iPad Pro (Don't Buy)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#15-MacBook-Air">15" MacBook Air (Neutral)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Air">13" MacBook Air (Don't Buy)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipad.137">iPad</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macbook-air.122">MacBook Air</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/21/new-ipads-and-macbook-airs-spring-2024-rumor/">New iPad Air, iPad Pro, and MacBook Air Models Likely to Launch in March or April</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/new-ipad-air-ipad-pro-and-macbook-air-models-likely-to-launch-in-march-or-april.2417019/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today premiered an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a> ad entitled "New Driver" on its YouTube channel, using the stress of being a parent of a new teenage driver to highlight the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/use-check-in-feature-ios-messages/">Check In feature of the Messages app</a> in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/U-7ibjo1xHc?si=iXyVOrX8o_Sp0BFL" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><br/>
Check In allows you to automatically notify a friend or family member when you've arrived at your destination, reassuring them of your safety. In the new ad, an anxious father watches as his daughter awkwardly backs a car out the family's driveway, hitting a skateboard and a garbage cart on her way.<br/>
<br/>
The scene then transitions to the father nervously sitting at the family's dining room table until he receives a Check In alert letting him know his daughter has arrived at school. The father breathes a sigh of relief as the tagline "Relax, it's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>" appears onscreen.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-ads/">Apple Ads</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/20/new-driver-iphone-15-ad/">&#039;New Driver&#039; iPhone 15 Ad Highlights Automatic Check In</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/new-driver-iphone-15-ad-highlights-automatic-check-in.2416910/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The design of Apple's upcoming 12.9-inch <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/">iPad Air</a> model has today allegedly been revealed in new CAD renders shared by <em><a href="https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/exclusive-12-9-inch-ipad-air-design-revealed-fresh-renders/">91Mobiles</a></em>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/12-9-ipad-air-render-back.jpg" alt="" width="3625" height="1801" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-931871" /><br/>
As expected, the renders show an overall appearance that is very similar to the &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; design used for the fourth- and fifth-generation models, but simply scaled up to accommodate a larger display.<br/>
<br/>
The most striking difference on the device is a redesigned rear camera unit, which now protrudes from the rear in a longer pill-shape, unlike the single, round protruding cutout on the current &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj;. This new design seems to be somewhat reminiscent of the rear camera unit of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> X and &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; XS.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/12-9-ipad-air-render-front.jpg" alt="" width="3625" height="1801" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-931872" /><br/>
On the front of the tablet, the &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; looks very similar to the current 12.9-inch <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a>, but with noticeably thicker bezels, just like how the 10.9-inch &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; has thicker borders around the display compared to the 11-inch &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
The device is expected to be targeted at those who want a bigger tablet than the current, 10.9-inch &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj;, but have no need for the high-end features of the 12.9-inch &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; such as ProMotion or a LiDAR scanner. This is similar to Apple's approach with the 13.6- and 15.3-inch <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/">MacBook Air</a>, as well as the 6.1-inch <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a> and 6.7-inch &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; Plus.<br/>
<br/>
<em>91Mobiles</em> also reiterated reports that the next-generation &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; will feature the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m2/">M2</a> chip. The device is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/12/larger-ipad-air-launching-early-2024/">rumored to enter production</a> in the first quarter of 2024, so it could already be underway. It is expected to launch "<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/06/ipad-air-ipad-pro-2024-refresh/">early</a>" this year, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/10/12-9-inch-ipad-air-display-shipments/">likely in March</a>.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/">iPad Air </a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/91mobiles-com/">91Mobiles</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPad-Air">iPad Air (Don't Buy)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipad.137">iPad</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/20/next-gen-ipad-air-with-12-9-inch-display-and-redesigned-camera-unit-revealed-in-cad-renders/">Next-Gen iPad Air With 12.9-Inch Display and Redesigned Camera Unit Revealed in CAD Renders</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/next-gen-ipad-air-with-12-9-inch-display-and-redesigned-camera-unit-revealed-in-cad-renders.2416895/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[After years of rumors and months of waiting following its unveiling, Apple's headset is finally just about here, with pre-orders going live in the U.S. ahead of an early February launch.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/top-stories-20jan2024.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-931799" /><br/>
While Vision Pro was the biggest news of the week, there were also big developments in the ongoing Apple Watch blood oxygen patent dispute, with Apple being forced to start selling Series 9 and Ultra 2 models with the sensor disabled for the time being.<br/>
<br/>
We also got a release time frame for upcoming iOS 17.3 and associated updates, while Apple is now begrudgingly allowing developers to offer non-Apple Store payment options for in-app purchases, so read on below for all the details!<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Apple Vision Pro Now Available for Pre-Order</h2><br/>
Apple is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/19/apple-vision-pro-now-available-for-pre-order/">now accepting pre-orders for the Apple Vision Pro</a>, the company's first spatial computing device. Orders are live in the U.S. online store ahead of the February 2 launch date with the Vision Pro limited to the United States for the time being, although shipping estimates for new orders <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/19/vision-pro-delivery-dates-slip/">quickly began slipping into March</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/Vision-Pro-Pre-Orders-Feature-2.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-931603" /><br/>
Alongside the start of pre-orders, Apple shared some additional details about the Vision Pro, including <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/19/apple-vision-pro-tech-specs/">full tech specs</a> such as storage options up to 1TB, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/19/applecare-plus-for-vision-pro/">AppleCare+ pricing</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/19/apple-releases-vision-pro-accessories/">available accessories</a>, and more.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Apple Begins Selling Series 9 and Ultra 2 Watches Without Blood Oxygen Feature in U.S. Amid Dispute</h2><br/>
<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/17/apple-watch-series-9-ultra-2-without-blood-oxygen/">Apple Watch Series 9 and Apple Watch Ultra 2 models sold in the U.S. no longer have a functional Blood Oxygen app</a> starting this week, allowing Apple to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/17/apple-watch-sales-ban-reinstated/">sidestep a sales ban</a> on these models. Previously-sold watches and models sold in other countries are not affected.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/09/apple-watch-series-6-blood-oxygen-monitoring-1.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="897" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-759072" /><br/>
The U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) last year <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/27/us-trade-tribunal-apple-watch-ban-masimo/">ordered an import and sales ban</a> on Apple Watch models with blood oxygen sensing after ruling that Apple violated Masimo's pulse oximetry patents. Masimo has accused Apple of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/18/apple-masimo-legal-battle/">stealing trade secrets and poaching employees</a>.<br/>
<br/>
As a longer-term solution, Apple is reportedly working on changes to the Blood Oxygen app's algorithm in an attempt to avoid Masimo's patented technology, but it's unclear when these changes will be ready.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Apple Releasing iOS 17.3 Next Week With These New Features</h2><br/>
In its press release <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/17/apple-watch-black-unity-band-2024/">unveiling a new Black Unity Sport Band</a> for the Apple Watch, Apple confirmed that <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/17/apple-releasing-ios-17-3-next-week/">iOS 17.3 will be released next week</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/12/iOS-17.3-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-926334" /><br/>
The software update includes a few new features and additions for the iPhone, including <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/12/ios-17-3-stolen-device-protection-feature/">Stolen Device Protection</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/13/ios-17-3-collaborative-playlist-emoji/">collaborative Apple Music playlists</a>, the ability to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/17/ios-17-3-airplay-hotel-room-tvs/">connect an iPhone to select hotel room TVs via AirPlay</a>, a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/17/apple-watch-black-unity-band-2024/">Unity Bloom wallpaper</a> for the Lock Screen, and more.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>U.S. Developers Can Now Offer Non-App Store Purchasing Option, But Apple Will Still Collect Commissions</h2><br/>
In adherence with a U.S. court ruling, Apple is now allowing App Store apps to feature a single link to a developer website that <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/16/us-app-store-alternative-purchase-option/">leads to an alternative payment option for in-app purchases</a>, but Apple plans to continue to collect a 12 to 27 percent commission on content bought in this manner.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/01/iOS-App-Store-General-Feature-JoeBlue.jpg" alt="" width="2250" height="1266" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-833073" /><br/>
This change comes after the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/16/supreme-court-declines-to-hear-apple-vs-epic-case/">U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear both Apple's and Epic Games' appeals</a> in their trial related to App Store rules, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/17/apple-wants-epic-games-legal-expenses/">Apple now wants Epic to pay its legal fees</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Kuo: Apple Vision Pro to Launch Internationally Before WWDC</h2><br/>
Apple supply chain analyst Ming-Chi Kuo believes the Vision Pro <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/16/vision-pro-to-launch-internationally-before-wwdc/">will launch in additional countries beyond the U.S. by WWDC 2024 in June</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/Apple-Vision-Pro-Dual-Loop-Band-Teal-Feature-2.jpg" alt="" width="1960" height="1102" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-929939" /><br/>
Apple previously announced that the Vision Pro would be released in additional countries later this year, but it did not list any specific countries. Canada, the UK, and other English-speaking nations are reportedly among the places where the headset is likely to launch next.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Apple Vision Pro Virtual Keyboard Blasted As 'Complete Write-Off'</h2><br/>
Vision Pro's keyboard floats in mid-air, allowing you to input text in your spatial computing environment while wearing the device.<br/>

However, anyone planning to ditch their physical keyboard may want to hold onto it for a little while longer. According to <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman, the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/15/apple-vision-pro-virtual-keyboard-criticism/">virtual keyboard experience in visionOS 1.0 is "a complete write-off,"</a> and most people will want to use a Bluetooth keyboard instead.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[As previously announced, Apple will be permanently closing its <a href="https://www.apple.com/retail/infiniteloop/">Infinite Loop</a> and <a href="https://www.apple.com/retail/royalhawaiian/">Royal Hawaiian</a> retail stores in the U.S. later today. Apple said all employees at both stores would be given the opportunity to remain with the company.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/12/Apple-Infinite-Loop-Store.jpeg" alt="" width="2880" height="1612" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-927735" /><div class="center-wrap"><em>Apple Infinite Loop</em></div><br/>
Infinite Loop served as Apple's headquarters in Cupertino, California from 1993 until 2017, when Apple Park opened nearby. The store on the campus is located at street level near the entrance to the main office building, and it has sold a mix of Apple products and Apple-branded merchandise, such as shirts, reusable bottles, mugs, and notebooks.<br/>
<br/>
After the <a href="https://www.apple.com/retail/appleparkvisitorcenter/">Apple Park Visitor Center</a> opened in 2017, the Infinite Loop store became redundant. The newer and larger Visitor Center carries Apple-branded merchandise, and it features a café, a rooftop terrace, and an augmented reality model of Apple Park. Apple also has a store <a href="https://www.apple.com/retail/valleyfair/">at the Valley Fair shopping mall</a> to serve customers in the area.<br/>
<br/>
"After many years of serving customers at our stores in the Bay Area, we plan to close our store at Infinite Loop," said Apple, in a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/21/apples-infinite-loop-store-closing-next-month/">statement shared last month</a>. The store will permanently close its doors at 6 p.m. local time today.<br/>
<br/>
Apple's store at Infinite Loop first opened in 1993 as The Company Store, and it mostly sold Apple-branded merchandise. The location became a more traditional Apple retail store in 2015 following renovations, but it still lacked a Genius Bar.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/Apple-Royal-Hawaiian.jpeg" alt="" width="2880" height="1612" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-929600" /><div class="center-wrap"><em>Apple Royal Hawaiian</em></div><br/>
Apple Royal Hawaiian in Honolulu will follow suit and permanently close its doors at 9 p.m. local time today, after over 15 years of operations.<br/>
<br/>
"Apple continuously evaluates its retail footprint to ensure it is in the best possible position to provide exceptional customer service and support for its customers," the company said in a letter to Hawaii's Department of Labor and Industrial Relations last year. Apple has two other stores in Honolulu at <a href="https://www.apple.com/retail/alamoana/">Ala Moana</a> and <a href="https://www.apple.com/retail/kahala/">Kahala</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Apple operates 271 other retail stores across the U.S., and it opened a new store in Seoul, South Korea earlier today.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-store/">Apple Store</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/20/two-apple-stores-permanently-close-today/">Two Apple Stores in U.S. Permanently Closing Today</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/two-apple-stores-in-u-s-permanently-closing-today.2416887/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<title>Apple Offers to Open NFC Payment Technology to Third-Party Developers in Europe</title>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple has proposed opening its NFC payment technology to third-party developers in Europe, allowing direct rivals to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-pay/">Apple Pay</a> to operate on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> for the first time.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/apple-pay-feature-dynamic-island.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-921515" /><br/>
Historically, the use of Apple's NFC chip in iPhones and Apple Watches for payments has been exclusively utilized by &zwnj;Apple Pay&zwnj;, limiting the ability of banks and other financial services to offer their own contactless payment solutions on Apple's platforms. In a statement to <em><a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/eu-commission-seeks-feedback-apple-offer-let-rivals-access-tap-and-go-tech-2024-01-19/">Reuters</a></em>, Apple said:<blockquote>We have offered commitments to provide third-party developers in the European Economic Area with an option that will enable their users to make NFC contactless payments from within their iOS apps, separate from Apple Pay and Apple Wallet.</blockquote>The concession comes as part of Apple's efforts to address antitrust charges levied by the European Commission, which accuse the company of stifling competition by restricting third-party access to NFC capabilities on iOS devices.<br/>
<br/>
Under the proposed commitments, developers of payment, banking, and digital wallet applications in the European Economic Area (EEA) will be able to integrate their own solutions with the NFC chip on Apple devices. This change means that consumers could have the option to use NFC-enabled apps from other providers, alongside or instead of &zwnj;Apple Pay&zwnj;. The commitment reportedly includes additional functionalities such as defaulting to preferred payment apps and integrating with Apple's security features like <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mask-face-id/">Face ID</a>.<br/>
<br/>
While the focus of these changes is within the EEA, a region broader than the European Union, the implications of the shift could have a broader impact on the mobile payments market globally. The EEA covers the overwhelming majority of the European market, and Apple's decision could set a precedent for its operations in other areas of the world in the future as antitrust scrutiny increases.<br/>
<br/>
As part of the review process, the European Commission is currently seeking feedback from rival companies and customers on Apple's proposed concessions. The final decision will consider the responses from these stakeholders. If approved, the implementation of Apple's proposed commitments will be monitored by a trustee reporting to the Commission.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/european-union/">European Union</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/european-commission/">European Commission</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/nfc/">NFC</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/europe/">Europe</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/antitrust/">Apple Antitrust</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-pay/">Apple Pay</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/20/apple-offers-to-open-nfc-in-europe/">Apple Offers to Open NFC Payment Technology to Third-Party Developers in Europe</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-offers-to-open-nfc-payment-technology-to-third-party-developers-in-europe.2416882/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<title>Belkin and Spigen Debut Apple Vision Pro Accessories</title>

		<description><![CDATA[With pre-orders now available for the Vision Pro, the first accessories for the upcoming device are starting to come out. So far, both Belkin and Spigen have announced Vision Pro-related products.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/vision-pro-battery-pack-holder.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1200" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-931847" /><br/>
Belkin worked with Apple to <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/HRDR2ZM/A/belkin-battery-holder-for-apple-vision-pro">design a Battery Holder</a> for the Vision Pro Battery Pack. Priced at &#36;50, the Belkin Battery Holder for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a> is the only non-Apple accessory that Apple is selling for Vision Pro at this time.<br/>
<br/>
The Vision Pro battery fits inside the Battery Holder, which can be worn with a cross-body strap or a cable clip that clips on to a belt or pants. Apple is selling the accessory as an add-on for those that do not have a pocket to put the battery in while wearing the Vision Pro.<br/>
<br/>
Spigen has debuted <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FSpigen-Klasden-Pouch-Designed-Vision%2Fdp%2FB0CNDX83NQ">a Vision Pro pouch</a> that offers protection for the device when it's not in use. Priced at &#36;90, Spigen's case is more than &#36;100 cheaper than the <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MW2F3LL/A/apple-vision-pro-travel-case">&#36;200 Vision Pro Travel Case</a> that Apple is selling.<br/>
<br/>

Spigen's case features a nylon exterior, leather carrying strap, and an EVA shell for protection. There's a padded interior that secures the Vision Pro in place, along with a secret <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airtags/">AirTag</a> compartment for tracking the Vision Pro. It also appears to have space for the Vision Pro battery pack, cable, and ZEISS lens inserts. The case is set to deliver between February 21 and 23, so it won't be available right at launch day.<br/>
<br/>

Other accessory makers like Speck <a href="https://speckproducts.com/pages/apple-vision-pro">have started teasing</a> Vision Pro products ranging from carrying cases to battery holders, so it shouldn't be long before we see a whole range of Vision Pro accessory options.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AppleVisionPro">Vision Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-vision-pro.209">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/19/apple-vision-pro-accessories-spigen-belkin/">Belkin and Spigen Debut Apple Vision Pro Accessories</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/belkin-and-spigen-debut-apple-vision-pro-accessories.2416841/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The Vision Pro comes with a number of Apple apps that are also available on the iPhone and the iPad. We've seen some of the apps over the past few months in tidbits of information that Apple has provided, but the <a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-vision-pro/specs/">Vision Pro technical specifications</a> that went live today alongside pre-orders list every app that the device comes with.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/visionos-home-screen-mt-hood.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-900011" /><br/>
<br/>
Pre-installed apps optimized for Vision Pro:<br/>
<ul><br/>
 	<li>App Store</li><br/>
 	<li>Encounter Dinosaurs</li><br/>
 	<li>Files</li><br/>
 	<li>Freeform</li><br/>
 	<li>Keynote</li><br/>
 	<li>Mail</li><br/>

 	<li>Notes</li><br/>

 	<li>Safari</li><br/>
 	<li>Settings</li><br/>
 	<li>Tips</li><br/>
 	<li>TV</li></ul><br/>
<br/>
Pre-installed apps not optimized for Vision Pro:<br/>
<br/>
 	<ul><li>Books</li><br/>
 	<li>Calendar</li><br/>
 	<li>Home</li><br/>
 	<li>Maps</li><br/>
 	<li>News</li><br/>
 	<li>Podcasts</li><br/>
 	<li>Reminders</li><br/>
 	<li>Shortcuts</li><br/>
 	<li>Stocks</li><br/>
 	<li>Voice Memos</li></ul><br/>
</ul><br/>
Curiously, while there is a Keynote app that's pre-installed, Apple does not list the other iWork apps like Pages and Numbers. Find My is not on Apple's list, nor are the Health, Clock, Contacts, and Weather apps. FaceTime is not on the list, but the fine print confirms that there is indeed a FaceTime app and also a Capture app for taking video and photos on the device.<br/>
<br/>
There may be some Apple apps that are not pre-installed but able to be downloaded from the App Store after launch, and there will be a number of third-party apps designed for the Vision Pro.<br/>
<br/>
We'll be sharing a list of Vision Pro apps closer to when the headset debuts, and it is also worth noting that many iOS apps will run on the device automatically unless developers opt out.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AppleVisionPro">Vision Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-vision-pro.209">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/19/vision-pro-pre-installed-apps/">Here Are All the Apps Pre-Installed on the Apple Vision Pro</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/here-are-all-the-apps-pre-installed-on-the-apple-vision-pro.2416836/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>
