		<description><![CDATA[There was definitely "something in the air" this week as Tim Cook promised, with Apple making a number of product announcements to breathe new life into several of its Mac and iPad products.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/03/top-stories-2025-03-08.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-993670" /><br/>
Some aspects of the announcements were expected while others were a bit of a surprise as was Apple looking to entice potential customers with some interesting choices for its new products, so read on below for all the details!<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Everything Apple Announced This Week</h2><br/>
It was a busy week for Apple with multiple new products announced on both Tuesday and Wednesday. We're now caught up on what's been rumored for a spring launch, so <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/05/everything-apple-announced-this-week/">check out our recap and video going over everything Apple announced</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/03/Everything-M3-iPad-Air-M4-MacBook-Air-Mac-M4-Studio-Thumb-3-2.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-993415" /><br/>
All of the new products are available for pre-order now and will launch on Wednesday, March 12.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Apple Announces New MacBook Air With M4 and 'Sky Blue' Color Option</h2><br/>
Apple on Wednesday announced <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/05/apple-announces-new-macbook-air-with-m4-and-sky-blue-color-option/">refreshed 13- and 15-inch MacBook Air models</a> featuring the M4 chip, an upgraded Center Stage camera, and a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/05/sky-blue-macbook-air-photos/">new Sky Blue color option</a> to replace Space Gray.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/03/Apple-MacBook-Air-hero.jpg" alt="" width="3840" height="2160" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-993128" /><br/>
The M4 chip features a 10-core CPU, an up to 10-core GPU, and support for up to 32GB of unified memory, and Apple says the new ‌MacBook Air‌ is up to 2x faster than the M1 model.<br/>
<br/>
The M4 MacBook Air also comes with a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/05/apple-m4-macbook-air-price-cut/">lower &#36;999 starting price</a>, allowing Apple to simplify the lineup by <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/05/apple-discontinues-m2-m3-macbook-air/">eliminating both the M2 and M3 models</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Apple Announces New Mac Studio With M4 Max and M3 Ultra Chips, Thunderbolt 5, and More</h2><br/>
Wednesday's other big announcement was an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/05/new-mac-studio-with-m4-max-and-m3-ultra/">updated Mac Studio</a> with M4 Max and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/05/apple-introduces-m3-ultra-chip/">M3 Ultra</a> chip options, Thunderbolt 5 ports, and more.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/mac-studio-green.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-901496" /><br/>
The M4 Max chip was already released last year in the 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro, and it can be configured with up to a 16-core CPU, up to a 40-core GPU, and up to 128GB of unified memory. The all-new M3 Ultra chip features up to a 32-core CPU with 24 performance cores and eight efficiency cores, up to 80 GPU cores, and up to 512GB of memory.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Apple Announces New iPad Air With M3 Chip, Updated Magic Keyboard</h2><br/>
Apple on Tuesday introduced <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/04/apple-announces-new-ipad-air-with-m3-chip/">new 11-inch and 13-inch iPad Air models</a> with the M3 chip, along with an updated Magic Keyboard for the device.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/03/M3-iPad-Air.jpg" alt="" width="1960" height="1102" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-992557" /><br/>
With the M3 chip, the new iPad Air should offer <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/06/ipad-air-m3-chip-benchmark-results/">up to 20% faster performance</a> compared to the previous-generation model with the M2 chip, which was released in May 2024. In addition, the M3 chip brings hardware-accelerated ray tracing to the iPad Air for the first time, providing improved graphics rendering in games.<br/>
<br/>
The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/04/apple-announces-redesigned-ipad-air-magic-keyboard/">new Magic Keyboard for the iPad Air</a> features a larger trackpad and function keys for easy access to features like display brightness and volume controls.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Apple Unveils 11th-Gen iPad With A16 Chip and More Storage</h2><br/>
Alongside the M3 iPad Air, Apple on Tuesday also <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/04/new-ipad-with-a16-and-more-storage/">announced the 11th-generation iPad</a>, now featuring the A16 chip and more storage.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/03/ipad-11-feature.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-992618" /><br/>
While the new iPad won't support Apple Intelligence, the A16 chip represents a significant upgrade over the A14 Bionic chip in the previous model, and the new iPad offers a better value as Apple has doubled the starting storage to 128GB. There's also a new 512GB tier at the high end.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple announced the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-studio/">Mac Studio</a> and Studio Display three years ago today.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/03/apple-studio-display.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="893" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-838874" /><br/>
The &zwnj;Mac Studio&zwnj; and Studio Display were unveiled as the final major announcements of Apple's "Peek Performance" event. Apple CEO <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tim-cook/">Tim Cook</a> introduced them as a completely new Mac product category and a powerful new display designed for creative professionals.<br/>
<br/>
The &zwnj;Mac Studio&zwnj; is positioned between the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-mini/">Mac mini</a> and the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-pro/">Mac Pro</a>. The first model featured the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m1-max/">M1 Max</a> or the newly introduced <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m1-ultra/">M1 Ultra</a> chip, offering the best performance of any Mac at the time. The base &zwnj;M1 Max&zwnj; model started at &#36;1,999, while the &zwnj;M1 Ultra&zwnj; variant began at &#36;3,999. Fully configured, the &zwnj;M1 Ultra&zwnj; model could exceed &#36;8,000. Many saw the &zwnj;Mac Studio&zwnj; and Studio Display as the spiritual successor to the 27-inch <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/">iMac</a>, which was discontinued on the same day as the &zwnj;Mac Studio&zwnj;'s launch.<br/>
<br/>
In June 2023, during the Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC), Apple announced <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m2/">M2</a> Max and &zwnj;M2&zwnj; Ultra chip options for the &zwnj;Mac Studio&zwnj;. Enhancements included support for up to six 6K monitors and improved connectivity options, such as Bluetooth 5.3 and Wi-Fi 6E.   <br/>
<br/>
Earlier this week, Apple introduced the latest iteration of the &zwnj;Mac Studio&zwnj;, now featuring the M4 Max and M3 Ultra chips. The M4 Max offers a 16-core CPU and up to a 40-core GPU, starting with 36GB of RAM, while the M3 Ultra boasts a 32-core CPU and up to an 80-core GPU, with configurations supporting up to 512GB of RAM. Both models include Thunderbolt 5 ports.<br/>
<br/>
The Studio Display marked Apple's reentry into the consumer display market after more than a decade of absence. Prior to its release, Apple only offered one high-end professional monitor in the form of 2019's Pro Display XDR, which was aimed at a niche audience with a price tag of &#36;4,999, without a stand. The Studio Display introduced a more accessible option for the wider range of users looking for a high-quality, premium external monitor that works well with Apple devices.<br/>
<br/>
Rumors suggest that Apple is developing a new Studio Display model with mini-LED backlighting, expected to be released later in 2025 or early 2026. <div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-studio/">Mac Studio</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Mac-Studio">Mac Studio (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/mac-studio.237">Mac Studio</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/08/mac-studio-and-studio-display-turn-three-today/">Mac Studio and Studio Display Turn Three Today</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/mac-studio-and-studio-display-turn-three-today.2452480/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<title>What Does the Siri Apple Intelligence Delay Mean for Apple&#039;s Rumored Smart Home Command Center?</title>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple is delaying some of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/07/apple-intelligence-siri-features-delayed/">Apple Intelligence Siri features</a> that it expected to be able to introduce as part of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a>, and it's not clear what that means for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-command-center/">rumored smart home hub</a> that the company is working on.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/11/Apple-AI-Command-Center-Concept-Mock-5.png" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-978087" /><br/>
The hub has been described as a "Command Center" for controlling Wi-Fi connected smart home products, and rumors suggest that <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a>'s planned feature set is meant to play a major role in the device's functionality. &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; is supposed to be getting smarter, able to learn more about users and to do more in and between apps, which would go a long way toward making a smart home control device more appealing.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/12/apple-home-command-center-march-2025/">Back in November</a>, <em>Bloomberg</em>'s <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a> said the device had been designed around App Intents, the more advanced app and task control feature set that is delayed. Gurman also said that it would be marketed as a way to chat with &zwnj;Siri&zwnj;, and that the device is "designed to bring &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/">Apple Intelligence</a> to life in a way that hasn't happened before."<br/>
<br/>
Gurman initially said the device could launch as soon as March 2025, but in January, he suggested Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/13/apple-smart-home-hub-launch-possibly-delayed/">would not make</a> that timeline due to &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; delays. With the &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; &zwnj;Apple Intelligence&zwnj; features being pushed back even further, it's entirely possible Apple's "Command Center" won't be ready to go until 2026.<br/>
<br/>
Apple's acknowledgement of the delay suggests that the &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; capabilities aren't going to be introduced until <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-19/">iOS 19</a>, and the timing remains unclear.<br/>
<br/>
The smart home hub is expected to look something like a mini <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>, and it will be square in shape with a six-inch display. In addition to controlling smart home products, it will have a selection of Apple apps so people will be able to make video calls, look up recipes, listen to music, access their calendars, view photos, and more.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-command-center/">Apple Command Center</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/07/siri-delay-smart-home-command-center/">What Does the Siri Apple Intelligence Delay Mean for Apple&#039;s Rumored Smart Home Command Center?</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/what-does-the-siri-apple-intelligence-delay-mean-for-apples-rumored-smart-home-command-center.2452457/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<title>Apple Likely Targeting iOS 19 for Delayed Siri Features</title>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today shared a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/07/apple-intelligence-siri-features-delayed/">somewhat vague statement</a> announcing that some of its planned <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/">Apple Intelligence</a> <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a> features will take longer than expected to develop, and it's sounding like those &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; capabilities aren't going to be implemented until <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-19/">iOS 19</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/apple-intelligence-black.jpeg" alt="" width="1400" height="788" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-963902" /><br/>
Apple's statement, for context:<blockquote>"Siri helps our users find what they need and get things done quickly, and in just the past six months, we've made Siri more conversational, introduced new features like type to Siri and product knowledge, and added an integration with ChatGPT. We've also been working on a more personalized Siri, giving it more awareness of your personal context, as well as the ability to take action for you within and across your apps. It's going to take us longer than we thought to deliver on these features and we anticipate rolling them out in the coming year."</blockquote>"In the coming year" isn't exactly concrete, and could be interpreted as in the next 12 months, or as 2026. If it's taken as in the next 12 months, that leaves room for a launch that's still part of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a>, but 2026 is firmly &zwnj;iOS 19&zwnj;. Direct Apple acknowledgements of product delays are uncommon, and if Apple was on track to introduce the &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; features in &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj;, would the company bother to make a delay announcement at all? It seems unlikely. For that reason alone, there's a good chance Apple has pushed the feature set to &zwnj;iOS 19&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
<em><a href="https://daringfireball.net/2025/03/apple_is_delaying_the_more_personalized_siri_apple_intelligence_features">Daring Fireball</a></em>'s John Gruber has come to a similar conclusion, suggesting Apple's "years" refer to product years that start at WWDC. It is his opinion that Apple is subtly suggesting an &zwnj;iOS 19&zwnj; launch timeline.<br/>
<blockquote>Reading between the lines, and based on my PhD-level fluency in Cupertino-ese, what Apple is saying here is that these "more personalized Siri" features are being punted from this year's OS cycle to next year's: to iOS 19 and MacOS 16. Apple's years in this context aren't calendar years, but Apple's OS product years. Those years effectively start at WWDC.</blockquote><br/>
Further, both <em><a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/apple-says-some-ai-improvements-siri-delayed-2026-2025-03-07/">Reuters</a></em> and <em><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/07/apple-delays-siri-ai-improvements-to-2026.html">CNBC</a></em> interpreted Apple's statement as a delay of the &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; features until 2026, and wrote headlines stating as much. If Apple was only counting on a delay of a couple of months, it's likely the company would correct the 2026 assumption, but Apple has offered no further clarification nor has it asked for those sites to change their wording.<br/>
<br/>
We'll get the first &zwnj;iOS 19&zwnj; update in September 2025 alongside new iPhones, so if 2026 ends up being accurate, the &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; features might not even come in the &zwnj;iOS 19&zwnj; release. They'll instead be slated for a future &zwnj;iOS 19&zwnj; update, perhaps iOS 19.2 or iOS 19.3.<br/>
<br/>
The vague wording of Apple's statement gives it some runway to tweak launch timing. The company has up to 12 months to provide the promised &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; functionality after admitting to a delay, so there's a good chance Apple is aiming for the September &zwnj;iOS 19&zwnj; release, but tempering expectations in case it takes longer.<br/>
<br/>
Apple announced the personalized &zwnj;Apple Intelligence&zwnj; &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; features at WWDC 2024, and initially said the functionality would come in &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj;. Rumors suggested Apple was aiming for an iOS 18.4 release, but couldn't meet that timeline. Until now, there was still hope for a launch in iOS 18.5 or iOS 18.6, but there are strong implications that the feature set is going to be bundled into &zwnj;iOS 19&zwnj; or an update to &zwnj;iOS 19&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
The &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; features that we're waiting on include personal context to allow &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; to keep track of emails, messages, files, photos, and more, and deeper app integration that lets &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; do more in and across apps.<br/>
<br/>
Apple is also working on an LLM version of &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; similar to ChatGPT and Google Gemini, and while that was initially planned for the &zwnj;iOS 19&zwnj; update, it now seems Apple is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/02/ios-19-delayed-feature/">going to hold it until iOS 20</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Update:</b> <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-07/apple-confirms-delay-of-ai-infused-personalized-siri-assistant"><em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman</a> says that the &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; features "won't be released until next year at the earliest." Some people in Apple's AI division think the features could even be "scrapped altogether and rebuilt from scratch.<br/>
<br/>
There are some concerns that fixing &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; could require more powerful hardware, which would mean Apple needs to reduce its feature set or make the models run more slowly on current devices. <div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-19/">iOS 19</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/07/apple-ios-19-siri-delay/">Apple Likely Targeting iOS 19 for Delayed Siri Features</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-likely-targeting-ios-19-for-delayed-siri-features.2452451/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today scored another victory in the ongoing lawsuit that AliveCor levied <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/05/26/alivecor-apple-watch-antitrust-lawsuit/">against it in 2021</a>, with the federal appeals court confirming the invalidation of three patents that AliveCor claimed Apple violated with the Apple Watch. As a result, the court has <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/12/06/apple-alivecor-patents-invalidated/">vacated an ITC ruling</a> that could have led to an Apple Watch import ban.<br/>
<br/>

In a statement to <em>MacRumors</em>, Apple thanked the court for its work and said that it will continue to develop new Apple Watch health features.<br/>
<blockquote>We thank the Federal Circuit for its careful consideration in this case. Apple's teams have worked tirelessly over many years to develop industry-leading health, wellness and safety features that meaningfully impact users' lives, and we intend to stay on this path."</blockquote><br/>
After AliveCor sued Apple, the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) initially found that Apple had violated three AliveCor patents related to heart rate monitoring and ECG technology. Apple then asked the USPTO's Patent Trial and Appeal Board (PTAB) <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/12/06/apple-alivecor-patents-invalidated/">to review the patents</a>, and the board found that several claims were not patentable, ultimately invalidating the patents and weakening AliveCor's case against Apple.<br/>
<br/>
The International Trade Commission (ITC) still went on to recommend a limited exclusion order and a cease-and-desist for the Apple Watch, which Apple appealed given that the patents involved in the case were invalidated. The order was suspended while appeals on both sides played out, with Apple seeking an appeal of the ITC ruling and AliveCor appealing the PTAB ruling invalidating the patents.<br/>
<br/>
The federal appeals court upheld the ruling invalidating the patents, and vacated the ITC's decision as a result, so there will be no Apple Watch import ban in the AliveCor case. In a statement to <em>MacRumors</em>, AliveCor said it was disappointed with the decision. <blockquote> We are deeply disappointed by the Court’s decisions this morning and that the Court did not review the available secondary considerations, which the ITC found to be persuasive in their finding of validity. Today's ruling does not affect our business or ability to continue innovating for our growing base of millions of customers.<br/>
<br/>
These cases go beyond AliveCor; these cases represent every small company and every future innovation that is at risk of being suppressed by a Goliath. Our fight against Apple is necessary to preserve innovation, fair competition, and the ability to ensure that inventors - both today and of the future - have the IP protection needed to build and scale new technologies.<br/>
<br/>
We will continue to explore all available legal options, including potential appeals, to defend our position that our patents are valid and that Apple infringed our intellectual property rights. As we move forward, our focus remains on transforming the industry with clinically validated, AI-powered solutions that help democratize access to cardiac care.</blockquote>Last year, AliveCor's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/06/apple-wins-alivecor-antitrust-fight/">antitrust lawsuit</a> against Apple was also dismissed, a decision that AliveCor is appealing.<br/>
<br/>
Apple has not been as successful in a different legal battle against blood oxygen company Masimo, and Apple Watch models in the United States are still subject to an import ban. Apple has <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/18/apple-website-apple-watch-blood-oxygen-removal/">disabled blood oxygen sensing</a> technology in Apple Watch models sold in the U.S., and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/05/masimo-apple-california-trade-secret-trial/">has not yet been able</a> to reinstate it.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/alivecor/">AliveCor</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/itc/">ITC</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/07/apple-alivecor-itc-win/">Apple Watch Won&#039;t Face Import Ban as Apple Wins AliveCor ITC Battle</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-watch-wont-face-import-ban-as-apple-wins-alivecor-itc-battle.2452450/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It's been a week since Apple released the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16e/">iPhone 16e</a>, its new low-cost (but not as low-cost as before) smartphone. The &zwnj;iPhone 16e&zwnj; has many of the same capabilities as Apple's flagship iPhones, but it is lacking in some key areas to save money. So, is it worth the savings? <em>MacRumors</em> videographer Dan Barbera spent a week with the &zwnj;iPhone 16e&zwnj; as his main <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> to see what he could live without.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe title="One Week with iPhone 16e: I Was WRONG!" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/43L8j9F88WA" width="1187" height="668" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe><em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/macrumors?sub_confirmation=1">Subscribe to the MacRumors YouTube channel</a> for more videos.</em></div><br/>
At &#36;599, the &zwnj;iPhone 16e&zwnj; is quite a bit more expensive than the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; SE 3 that it replaces, but it offers a current-generation A18 chip, an all-display design with <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mask-face-id/">Face ID</a> instead of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/touch-id/">Touch ID</a> and OLED technology, a 48-megapixel single-lens rear camera, long battery life, USB-C, and safety features like Emergency SOS via Satellite and Crash Detection, all of which were not in the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; SE.<br/>
<br/>
Most iPhones have had two or more cameras for several years now, so the single-lens camera on the &zwnj;iPhone 16e&zwnj; is surprisingly subtle and makes for a clean, minimal design where the camera isn't the dominant feature drawing the eye. There's also less weight with the slimmed down camera setup, so it doesn't feel heavy in the hand. You can only get the &zwnj;iPhone 16e&zwnj; in black or white, but they're classic colors.<br/>
<br/>
Since Apple slimmed down the bezels with the flagship <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a> lineup, the bezels on the &zwnj;iPhone 16e&zwnj; are more noticeable, but that's something that will mostly only come up when it's right next to an &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj;. Apple modeled the &zwnj;iPhone 16e&zwnj; after the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 14, so it's also got a notch instead of a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/dynamic-island/">Dynamic Island</a>. The OLED display doesn't support 120Hz, and it's not quite as bright as what you get with the &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj;. You're also not going to get the always-on display, and if that's something you're used to, you might miss it. But if you've never had that functionality, you won't know the difference.<br/>
<br/>
There's no Camera Control button, but you do get an Action Button and support for all of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/">Apple Intelligence</a> features, including <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/visual-intelligence/">Visual Intelligence</a>. It's just activated from the Control Center or Action Button instead of Camera Control. The Camera Control button isn't something most people will likely care about. The A18 chip is basically the same chip you get in the &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj;, but with one less GPU core, a change that's not super noticeable.<br/>
<br/>
Apple added a USB-C port for charging, but one major absence is support for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe/">MagSafe</a> and Qi2. There is no magnetic ring in the &zwnj;iPhone 16e&zwnj;, so it does not work with all of the magnetic accessories that have come out for iPhones over the last several years. It's also limited to 7.5W charging speeds instead of the 15W you can get with &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; or Qi2, and that's a big downside.<br/>
<br/>
If you've never had &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj;, you won't mind charging primarily with a cable, but if you have &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; accessories already, it's going to be a downgrade.<br/>
<br/>
The 48-megapixel camera is about the same as the camera in the &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj;, and it can take 1x and 2x photos. You don't get a Telephoto lens with 5x zoom or an Ultra Wide lens with 0.5x zoom and macro photo capabilities, but those are more niche camera features that are more nice to have than essential.<br/>
<br/>
The &zwnj;iPhone 16e&zwnj; has one unique component, and that's Apple's C1 modem. So far, it seems to be performing about the same as Qualcomm's modem chip, though there is no support for the faster mmWave 5G networks. We didn't see any notable speed difference between the &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPhone 16e&zwnj; when testing the devices on Verizon's network, but the C1 modem actually seemed to be more reliable in some instances where signal was low.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple is delaying some of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/">Apple Intelligence</a> <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a> features that it expected to release in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a>, an Apple spokesperson said in a statement to <em><a href="https://daringfireball.net/2025/03/apple_is_delaying_the_more_personalized_siri_apple_intelligence_features">Daring Fireball</a></em>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/Apple-Intelligence-General-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-956491" /><br/>
Apple says that it is going to take longer than expected to roll out the more personalized &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; experience, and that these features will be rolled out "in the coming year."<blockquote>"Siri helps our users find what they need and get things done quickly, and in just the past six months, we've made Siri more conversational, introduced new features like type to Siri and product knowledge, and added an integration with ChatGPT. We've also been working on a more personalized Siri, giving it more awareness of your personal context, as well as the ability to take action for you within and across your apps. It's going to take us longer than we thought to deliver on these features and we anticipate rolling them out in the coming year."</blockquote>The personalized &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; features that Apple is talking about were demonstrated at WWDC when introducing &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj;, and they were expected to come out in an update to &zwnj;iOS 18&zwnj;. The functionality includes personal context, onscreen awareness, and improved app integration. A quick summary:<br/>
<br/>
<h3 id="personal_context">Personal Context</h3><br/>
With personal context, &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; will be able to keep track of emails, messages, files, photos, and more, learning more about you to help you complete tasks and keep track of what you've been sent.<br/>
<ul><br/>
 <li>Show me the files Eric sent me last week.</li><br/>
 <li>Find the email where Eric mentioned ice skating.</li><br/>
 <li>Find the books that Eric recommended to me.</li><br/>
 <li>Where's the recipe that Eric sent me?</li><br/>
 <li>What's my passport number?</li><br/>
</ul><br/>
<h3 id="onscreen_awareness">Onscreen Awareness</h3><br/>
Onscreen awareness will let &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; see what's on your screen and complete actions involving whatever you're looking at. If someone texts you an address, for example, you can tell &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; to add it to their contact card. Or if you're looking at a photo and want to send it to someone, you can ask &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; to do it for you.<br/>
<br/>
<h3 id="deeper_app_integration">Deeper App Integration</h3><br/>
Deeper app integration means that &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; will be able to do more in and across apps, performing actions and completing tasks that are just not possible with the personal assistant right now. We don't have a full picture of what &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; will be capable of, but Apple has provided a few examples of what to expect.<br/>
<ul><br/>
 <li>Moving files from one app to another.</li><br/>
 <li>Editing a photo and then sending it to someone.</li><br/>
 <li>Get directions home and share the ETA with Eric.</li><br/>
 <li>Send the email I drafted to Eric.</li><br/>
</ul><br/>
<br/>
Rumors suggested that Apple initially planned to introduce these features in iOS 18.4, but ahead of the first iOS 18.4 betas, there were reports that the functionality simply wasn't ready. Apple will debut an iOS 18.5 update after iOS 18.4, so we could see the new &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; features in that update, but it's possible we'll be waiting even longer. "In the coming year" is a bit vague, but it looks like the new &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; functionality will come sometime in the next 12 months. <br/>
<br/>
Apple did already update &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; with a new Type to &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; feature, a refreshed look, ChatGPT integration, and more natural language understanding as part of its &zwnj;Apple Intelligence&zwnj; improvements, with more to come in the future.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/05/apple-introduces-m3-ultra-chip/">new M3 Ultra chip</a> can be configured with a massive 80-core GPU, and an early benchmark result offers a look at its graphics performance.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/03/M3-Ultra-Chip.jpg" alt="" width="1960" height="1092" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-993147" /><br/>
In <a href="https://browser.geekbench.com/v6/compute/3785744">one Geekbench 6 result</a> for the new Mac Studio, the M3 Ultra with an 80-core GPU achieved a Metal score of 259,668, up from 222,582 for the M2 Ultra chip with a 76-core GPU in the previous-generation Mac Studio. If that single result is accurate, then the M3 Ultra offers up to 16% faster graphics performance than the M2 Ultra.<br/>
<br/>
This means the M3 Ultra offers the best graphics performance of any Apple chip ever.<br/>
<br/>
In the 16-inch MacBook Pro, the highest-end M4 Max chip with a 40-core GPU has an average Metal score of 187,460, so the M3 Ultra appears to offer up to 38% faster graphics performance than the M4 Max based on the one result.<br/>
<br/>
A few other Geekbench 6 results for the M3 Ultra chip with an 80-core GPU show Metal scores in the 195,000 range. We believe those results are inaccurate, as it would not make any sense for the score to be that low. <br/>
<br/>
As for CPU performance, we previously reported that the M3 Ultra is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/06/m3-ultra-chip-first-benchmark-result/">up to 10% faster than the previous-fastest M4 Max chip</a>.<br/>
<br/>
The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/05/new-mac-studio-with-m4-max-and-m3-ultra/">new Mac Studio</a> is available to pre-order now on Apple's online store, and it will launch in stores on Wednesday, March 12. In the U.S., pricing starts at &#36;1,999 for M4 Max configurations, and at &#36;3,999 for M3 Ultra configurations.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-studio/">Mac Studio</a></div><div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/benchmarks/">Benchmarks</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/geekbench/">Geekbench</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Mac-Studio">Mac Studio (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/mac-studio.237">Mac Studio</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/07/m3-ultra-chip-gpu-benchmark/">M3 Ultra Chip&#039;s Massive 80-Core Graphics Performance Revealed in Benchmark Result</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/m3-ultra-chips-massive-80-core-graphics-performance-revealed-in-benchmark-result.2452431/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

<br/>
Now that the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16e/">iPhone 16e</a> is available, we explore first-hand impressions of the device, including its design, camera, display, and custom modem. Apple this week unveiled a new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/">iPad Air</a> featuring the M3 chip, a refreshed entry-level &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; with the A16 chip, and a redesigned Magic Keyboard for the &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj;. The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/">MacBook Air</a> now offers the M4 chip and an all-new "Sky Blue" color option, now starting at just &#36;999. Meanwhile, the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-studio/">Mac Studio</a> has been refreshed with M4 Max and M3 Ultra chip options.<br/>
<br/>
We take a look at why the &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj;'s refresh is relatively small and who should buy it, the entry-level &zwnj;iPad&zwnj;'s peculiar omission of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/">Apple Intelligence</a> support, and differences between the &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj;'s Magic Keyboard and that of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a>. We also discuss thoughts on the &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj;'s unexpected new finish, as well as the unusual chip generation difference among the new &zwnj;Mac Studio&zwnj;'s options.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Amazon this week has Apple's AirPods Pro 2 for <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0D1XD1ZV3%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"><strong>&#36;169.99</strong></a>, down from &#36;249.00. This is the lowest price that we've tracked so far in 2025, and Amazon is providing an early March delivery estimate for most residences in the United States.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Although we saw a better deal over the holiday season, it's very unlikely that all-time low price will return any time soon. Amazon's price today is still a solid deal on the AirPods Pro 2, which feature USB-C charging and Active Noise Cancellation.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Now that Apple has announced its new more affordable iPhone 16e, and new MacBook Air and Mac Studio models with M4 and M3 Ultra chips, we thought we'd provide a quick recap of what else we are expecting from the company in the summer months ahead. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/03/Apple-Summer-2025-Feature-1.jpg" alt="" width="2250" height="1265" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-993869" /><br/>
There are at least three product categories that we are hoping to see some movement in before summer is over, but of course, nothing is guaranteed. Keep reading to learn what they are.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Smart Home Command Center</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/11/Apple-AI-Command-Center-Concept-Mock-Gray-3.5.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-978083" /><br/>
Apple is working on a new Home accessory that is designed to serve as a central hub or "Command Center" for smart home management. Apple's upcoming iPad-like smart home accessory could be released <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/30/apple-launch-smart-home-display-next-year/">as soon as early 2025</a>, according to <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman‌. However, he recently said that Apple might not be able to launch it until <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/13/apple-smart-home-hub-launch-possibly-delayed/">later in the year</a> due to its reliance on features coming in iOS 18.4 and iOS 19. Kuo believes the device will not be released until the second or third quarter of 2025. In February, Gurman said that the smart home hub launch is "<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/10/apple-home-hub-still-months-away/">still months away</a>."<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Mac Pro</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/01/Mac-Pro-Feature-Teal.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-880543" /><br/>
Apple will refresh the Mac Pro in the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/09/when-to-expect-m4-macbook-air-mac-studio-mac-pro/">summer of 2025</a>, according to a report from <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman. The next-generation Mac Pro was expected to use a new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/03/what-to-expect-from-m4-ultra-chip/">M4 Ultra chip</a>, but the recent debut of the M3 Ultra chip in the Mac Studio has <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/05/apple-confirms-m4-max-lacks-ultrafusion/">put that claim into question</a>. Apple has already said that its M4 Max chip lacks an UltraFusion connector, which would eventually have allowed for a doubled-up M4 Ultra chip in the future. As things stand, the next Mac Pro could end up getting the M3 Ultra chip, which Apple says is the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/05/apple-introduces-m3-ultra-chip/">fastest Mac chip it has ever released</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>AirTag 2</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/AirTag-2-Mock-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-917578" /><br/>
Apple is aiming to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/24/airtag-2-mid-2025-rumor/">release a new AirTag in mid-2025</a>, according to <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman, while another leaker has claimed Apple will launch the device in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/24/airtag-2-in-may-or-june-rumor/">May or June this year</a>. The next-generation AirTag will include an upgraded chip that enhances location tracking, claims Gurman. This could mean Apple plans to equip the device with the second-generation Ultra Wideband chip, first introduced in the iPhone 15 lineup last year.<br/>
<br/>
As part of its efforts to prevent stalking, Apple is also expected to make the AirTag's built-in speaker more difficult to remove. However, the overall design is likely to remain largely unchanged, so major visual differences from the current model are not anticipated. Additionally, the new AirTag is rumored to offer improved range, potentially extending the effectiveness of the Precision Finding feature over greater distances.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>iOS 19</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/11/Generic-iOS-19-Feature-Mock-Light.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-978991" /><br/>
Apple plans to unveil iOS 19 at the Worldwide Developers Conference in June 2025, but the official release won't happen until sometime in September, when the new iPhone 17 lineup is expected to be announced. <br/>
<br/>
Rumors suggest that Apple's continued work on iOS 18 features is pushing back development on iOS 19, so we may see new capabilities come out on a rolling basis like we did for iOS 18. iOS 19 could feature a revamped Camera app with a design inspired by visionOS, according to one rumor. The design of Apple's most recent apps, Invites, Apple Sports, and Apple Playground, hint at the visionOS-like redesign we could see in iOS 19. The apps have more translucent user interface elements, expanding buttons, and an emphasis on content. We could also see other visionOS-style app redesigns, but the Camera app is the only redesign rumored as of now. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/01/iOS-19-Alleged-Camera-App-Render.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="797" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-985953" /><br/>
Apple is developing a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/21/apple-llm-siri-2026/">much smarter version of Siri</a> that utilizes advanced large language models or LLMs, allowing the personal assistant to better compete with AI-powered chatbots like ChatGPT. However, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/02/ios-19-delayed-feature/"><em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman</a> recently said Apple is no longer planning to unveil the more conversational Siri at WWDC 2025 in June this year, and it appears that the feature is no longer on track to launch as part of iOS 19.4 in March or April next year. Instead, he said that some Apple software engineers believe that the Siri overhaul will not launch until at least iOS 20.<br/>
<br/>
In the meantime, iOS 18.5 should be released in May, and with it, Siri is expected to gain on-screen awareness, understanding of personal context, and deeper per-app controls. <br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/07/new-apple-products-rumored-summer-2025/">Here Are the New Apple Products We&#039;re Expecting This Summer</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/here-are-the-new-apple-products-were-expecting-this-summer.2452427/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[In a move that probably won't make headlines but should delight detail-oriented Mac users everywhere, Apple has quietly corrected a 26-year-old design inconsistency on its keyboards.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/03/Apple-MacBook-Air-hero.jpg" alt="" width="3840" height="2160" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-993128" /><br/>
The Mute key, a staple on Mac keyboards since the PowerBook G3 'Lombard' debuted in 1999, has finally received a logical redesign on the new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/">MacBook Air</a> with M4 chip. As spotted by <em><a href="https://www.iculture.nl/nieuws/mute-toets-mac/">iCulture</a></em>, the key now displays a speaker with a strike through it – matching the actual on-screen indicator that appears when you press it in macOS.<br/>
<br/>
For over two decades, the Mute key has confusingly shown just a speaker icon, providing no obvious visual indication that it silences your Mac. Meanwhile, pressing it would display a completely different but more accurate symbol on screen: a speaker with a line through it. To be fair, it is a toggle key that both mutes and un-mutes audio, but the new mute icon more recognizably informs what the key does – just like on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a> Remote.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/03/old-mac-keyboard-mute.jpeg" alt="" width="1500" height="949" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-993726" /><div class="center-wrap"><em>Mute key symbol on previous Mac keyboards</em></div><br/>
This small but meaningful correction resolves a surprising design inconsistency that has persisted through countless keyboard iterations across dozens of Mac models.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/03/new-mac-keyboard-mute.jpeg" alt="" width="1500" height="949" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-993727" /><div class="center-wrap"><em>Mute key symbol on new &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj;</em></div><br/>
The redesigned Mute key isn't limited to the &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj;, either. The new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/">iPad Air</a>'s Magic Keyboard also incorporates the corrected icon. In fact, you could call this a "double upgrade" for &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; users, as previous Magic Keyboard models have lacked function keys entirely.<br/>
<br/>
The keyboard change is typical of Apple's meticulous attention to detail, even if it took more than a quarter-century to implement.<br/>
<br/>
It seems likely that all future Mac models will adopt this revised Mute key design. The next expected release, a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro/">MacBook Pro</a> with M5 chip anticipated around October, will presumably incorporate the updated key icon. <div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/">MacBook Air</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#15-MacBook-Air">15" MacBook Air (Buy Now)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Air">13" MacBook Air (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macbook-air.122">MacBook Air</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/07/new-macbook-air-corrects-design-mistake/">New MacBook Air Quietly Fixes This Decades-Long Design Oversight</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/new-macbook-air-quietly-fixes-this-decades-long-design-oversight.2452424/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[OpenAI has updated the <a href="https://openai.com/chatgpt/download/">ChatGPT app for macOS</a> with the ability to directly edit code in popular development environments including Xcode, VS Code, and JetBrains tools.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/03/chatgpt-macos-edit-xcode.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="902" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-993732" /><br/>
The new feature allows the AI chatbot to make changes to code without requiring users to copy and paste between applications. ChatGPT can now read code from these environments and make edits directly within them.<br/>
<br/>
An optional "auto-apply" mode enables ChatGPT to implement changes without additional clicks. Alexander Embiricos, a member of OpenAI's product team, <a href="https://x.com/OpenAIDevs/status/1897700857833193955">shared a demonstration of the feature</a> on social media and noted that the capability will come to Windows "soon."<br/>
<br/>
The direct code editing functionality is currently available to ChatGPT Plus, Pro, and Team subscribers who update their macOS app. OpenAI plans to roll out the feature to Enterprise, Education, and free users next week.<br/>
<br/>
This update builds on ChatGPT's "work with apps" capability launched in beta <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/14/openai-chatgpt-xcode-for-mac/">last November</a>, which allowed the AI to read code from development environments but not directly modify it.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">ChatGPT for macOS can now edit code directly in IDEs.

		<description><![CDATA[Apple has increased the thickness of the upcoming iPhone 17 Pro Max compared to the current generation iPhone 16 Pro Max, claims the Chinese leaker known as <a href="https://weibo.com/5673255066/PhqFQjY5b">Ice Universe</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/02/iphone-17-pro-asherdipps.jpg" alt="" width="3840" height="2160" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-990412" /><br/>
Apple is said to have increased the depth of the iPhone 17 Pro Max to 8.725mm, up from 8.25mm on the iPhone 16 Pro Max, which would be a 0.475mm difference in thickness. The increase "surely means a larger battery," according to the leaker. Apart from depth, the iPhone 17 Pro Max's frame reportedly <a href="https://weibo.com/5673255066/PhqQrs9PB">remains unchanged</a>, and is otherwise identical to the iPhone 16 Pro Max.<br/>
<br/>
Up until now, we have not heard any rumors about a battery life increase for the iPhone 17 Pro Max or a change in dimensions, so if Ice Universe's information is accurate, this would be a new development. <br/>
<br/>
iPhone 17 Pro‌ models are expected to have a large rectangular camera bump with rounded corners, though Apple apparently plans to stick with a triangular arrangement for the rear camera lenses.<br/>
<br/>
Apple's premium devices are also rumored to have an aluminum frame, whereas the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro models have a titanium frame. The back of the devices will supposedly also have a new "part-aluminum, part-glass" design.<br/>
<br/>
Ice Universe also claimed today that the iPhone 17 Pro Max and Apple's all-new ultra-thin iPhone 17 Air <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/07/iphone-17-air-same-size-iphone-16-pro-max/">share identical dimensions</a> apart from the differing thickness of the devices. <div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17-pro/">iPhone 17 Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ice-universe/">Ice Universe</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/07/iphone-17-pro-max-thicker-larger-battery/">iPhone 17 Pro Max Said to Be Thicker to Accommodate Larger Battery</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-17-pro-max-said-to-be-thicker-to-accommodate-larger-battery.2452321/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's all-new ultra-thin iPhone 17 Air shares the same dimensions as the iPhone 17 Pro Max, with the only difference being in the thickness of the devices, according to the leaker Ice Universe.<br/>
<br/>

Posting to their <a href="https://weibo.com/5673255066/PhqSED0hS">Weibo account</a>, the Chinese leaker today claimed that the iPhone 17 Air and iPhone 17 Pro Max have identical body length, width, screen size, and bezels. "The only difference is the thickness," added the leaker. "The iPhone 17 Air is 5.5mm thick, while the iPhone 17 Pro Max is 8.725mm thick." <br/>
<br/>
If these dimension are accurate, they also suggest that the iPhone 17 Pro Max will itself be <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/07/iphone-17-pro-max-thicker-larger-battery/">substantially thicker</a> than the existing iPhone 16 Pro Max.<br/>
<br/>
Aside from the alleged 5.5mm thickness for the iPhone 17 Air, which we have heard before, Ice Universe's claims are quite a significant development and contrast with previous rumors. Last year, display industry analyst Ross Young said the iPhone 17 Air would have a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/06/iphone-17-slim-to-feature-6-55-inch-display/">6.55-inch display</a>, or a 6.6-inch display when rounded up. <br/>
<br/>
Notably, this display size was challenged last month by YouTube creator Jon Prosser, who claimed that the iPhone 17 Air will be equipped with a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/20/iphone-17-air-now-rumored-to-feature-6-7-inch-display/">larger 6.7-inch display</a>. (Young has since <a href="https://x.com/DSCCRoss/status/1892716912091472071">reiterated</a> his 6.55-inch display size claim for the iPhone 17 Air.)<br/>
<br/>
However, if Prosser is correct and the iPhone 17 Air has a 6.7-inch display, that's still far off the expected 6.9-inch display size of the iPhone 17 Pro Max. Apple increased the display size of the iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max last year, and they are expected to remain the same for the iPhone 17 Pro models. Indeed, Ice Universe today said that the frame of iPhone 17 Pro Max has not changed, and is "just like iPhone 16 Pro Max."<br/>

Ice Universe has previously revealed accurate dimensions of iPhones before they are released, including the sizes of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/08/iphone-16-pro-max-design-dimensions/">iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max</a>. Still, we are taking this particular rumor with a grain of salt for now until other sources can corroborate the claims. Apple is expected to launch the iPhone 17 lineup around its usual mid-September time frame. <div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17-pro/">iPhone 17 Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ice-universe/">Ice Universe</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/07/iphone-17-air-same-size-iphone-16-pro-max/">iPhone 17 Air and 17 Pro Max Allegedly Same Size Apart From Thickness</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-17-air-and-17-pro-max-allegedly-same-size-apart-from-thickness.2452320/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The first <a href="https://browser.geekbench.com/v6/cpu/10898551">alleged benchmark result</a> for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/05/apple-introduces-m3-ultra-chip/">Apple's new M3 Ultra chip</a> has surfaced in the Geekbench 6 database tonight, allowing for more performance comparisons. The high-end chip is available in the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/05/new-mac-studio-with-m4-max-and-m3-ultra/">new Mac Studio</a>, introduced earlier this week.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/03/M4-Max-and-M3-Ultra.jpg" alt="" width="1960" height="1102" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-993312" /><br/>
Apple said the M3 Ultra chip is the "highest-performing chip it has ever created," and the unverified benchmark result seems to confirm that. In the single result, the 32-core M3 Ultra chip achieved a multi-core CPU score of 27,749, which makes it around 8% faster than the 16-core M4 Max chip that previously held the performance record. The result also reveals that the M3 Ultra chip is up to 30% faster than the 24-core M2 Ultra chip.<br/>
<br/>
As expected, the M4 Max chip tops the M3 Ultra chip in terms of single-core CPU performance by nearly 20%, according to the result. This is due in part to the M4 Max chip being manufactured with TSMC's second-generation 3nm process, whereas the M3 Ultra is likely based on TSMC's first-generation 3nm process.<br/>
<br/>
We now await additional M3 Ultra benchmark results to see if these scores are accurate, as they seem to be on the lower side compared to what was expected. For example, Apple advertised the M3 Ultra chip as being up to 1.5x faster than the M2 Ultra chip, so that 30% increase mentioned above should seemingly be closer to the 50% mark. Apple never said how the M3 Ultra chip's performance compares to the M4 Max chip, though.<br/>
<br/>
As always, real-world performance may vary somewhat, but synthetic benchmark tools like Geekbench 6 provide a useful baseline for comparisons.<br/>
<br/>
Watch this space, as we would not be surprised if additional Geekbench 6 results for the M3 Ultra chip end up having higher performance scores.<br/>
<br/>
The benchmark was <a href="https://x.com/jimmyjames_tech/status/1897847411050955010">spotted by @jimmyjames_tech</a> and <a href="https://x.com/VadimYuryev/status/1897849477706481701">shared by Vadim Yuryev</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Update:</strong> <a href="https://browser.geekbench.com/v6/cpu/10904797">Three</a> <a href="https://browser.geekbench.com/v6/cpu/10903294">more</a> <a href="https://browser.geekbench.com/v6/cpu/10903239">M3 Ultra results</a> have surfaced in the Geekbench 6 database, and the average multi-core CPU score has increased to 28,160. This means the M3 Ultra chip is around 10% faster than the M4 Max chip, up from the original 8% figure. Overall, it looks like the M3 Ultra chip is indeed not much faster than the M4 Max.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-studio/">Mac Studio</a></div><div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/benchmarks/">Benchmarks</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/geekbench/">Geekbench</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Mac-Studio">Mac Studio (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/mac-studio.237">Mac Studio</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/06/m3-ultra-chip-first-benchmark-result/">M3 Ultra Chip is Only 10% Faster Than M4 Max in Benchmark Results</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/m3-ultra-chip-is-only-10-faster-than-m4-max-in-benchmark-results.2452256/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple has a staggering marketing claim for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/05/apple-announces-new-macbook-air-with-m4-and-sky-blue-color-option/">new MacBook Air</a> with the M4 chip.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/03/Apple-MacBook-Air-hero.jpg" alt="" width="3840" height="2160" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-993128" /><br/>
Specifically, Apple <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/03/apple-introduces-the-new-macbook-air-with-the-m4-chip-and-a-sky-blue-color/">says</a> the new MacBook Air is up to 23x faster than the last Intel-based model. However, there are some details in the fine print to be aware of.<br/>
<br/>
First, Apple said it compared a new 2025 MacBook Air with a 10-core M4 chip and 32GB of RAM to a 2020 MacBook Air with a quad-core Intel Core i7 processor and 16GB of RAM. Both of the MacBook Air models were configured with a 2TB SSD. These are the best specifications that are or were available for each of these MacBook Air models.<br/>
<br/>
So, Apple compared the new model to the fastest-ever Intel-based MacBook Air. That's fair.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/03/MacBook-Air-23x.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="675" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-993659" /><br/>
Second, Apple said its test consisted of using the Super Resolution feature on a 4.4MB image in image editing app Pixelmator Pro — which it <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/11/apple-completes-pixelmator-acquisition/">now owns</a>. The feature uses machine learning to increase the resolution of images, while preserving sharpness and details.<br/>
<br/>
So, the up to 23x faster performance claim is tied to quite a specific task. <br/>
<br/>
Here is what Apple's fine print says in full:<blockquote>Testing conducted by Apple in January 2025 using preproduction 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Air systems with Apple M4, 10-core CPU, 10-core GPU, and 32GB of RAM, as well as production 1.2GHz quad-core Intel Core i7-based MacBook Air systems with Intel Iris Plus Graphics and 16GB of RAM, all configured with 2TB SSD. Tested using Super Resolution with Pixelmator Pro 3.6.14 and a 4.4MB image. Performance tests are conducted using specific computer systems and reflect the approximate performance of MacBook Air.</blockquote>What about other tasks? Apple provided some more comparisons:<blockquote>- Spreadsheet calculation performance in Microsoft Excel is up to 4.7x faster than the fastest Intel-based MacBook Air, and up to 1.6x faster than the 13-inch MacBook Air with M1.<br/>
- Video editing in iMovie is up to 8x faster than the fastest Intel-based MacBook Air, and up to 2x faster than the 13-inch MacBook Air with M1.<br/>
- Photo editing in Adobe Photoshop is up to 3.6x faster than the fastest Intel-based MacBook Air, and up to 2x faster than the 13-inch MacBook Air with M1.<br/>
- Web browsing is up to 60 percent faster when compared to a PC laptop with an Intel Core Ultra 7 processor, and more demanding tasks get up to 2x faster performance.</blockquote>Those claims seem more realistic for most users.<br/>
<br/>
Ultimately, while the 23x claim might be overselling things a bit, it is true that any MacBook Air with an M1 chip or newer is dramatically faster than any Intel-based model. If you have been holding off on upgrading, you are in for a treat.<br/>
<br/>
You can pre-order the new MacBook Air now on Apple's online store, and it will begin arriving to customers on Wednesday, March 12.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/">MacBook Air</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#15-MacBook-Air">15" MacBook Air (Buy Now)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Air">13" MacBook Air (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macbook-air.122">MacBook Air</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/06/m4-macbook-air-up-to-23x-faster-vs-intel/">Apple Says New MacBook Air Up to 23x Faster Than Intel-Based Model, But Read the Fine Print</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-says-new-macbook-air-up-to-23x-faster-than-intel-based-model-but-read-the-fine-print.2452243/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>
