		<description><![CDATA[Apple today held an earnings call for the fourth fiscal quarter of 2023 (third calendar quarter), with Apple CEO <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tim-cook/">Tim Cook</a> and Apple CFO Luca Maestri sharing details on recent product sales, services growth, Apple's future plans, and more.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-834994" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/01/Apple-Logo-Cash-Feature-Yellow.jpg" alt="" width="2676" height="1504" /><br/>
We've highlighted the most interesting takeaways from Apple's earnings call.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Services</h2><br/>
Apple's quarterly revenue was down one percent year over year at &#36;89.5 billion, but services revenue hit a new all-time revenue record. Services revenue was &#36;22.3 billion, up 16 percent from &#36;19.2 billion in the year-ago quarter.<br/>
<br/>
Across all of 2023, Apple's services category brought in &#36;85 billion, up from &#36;78 billion in 2022.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a>, advertising, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/icloud/">iCloud</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/applecare/">AppleCare</a>, payment services, and video hit all-time revenue records, while <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/">Apple Music</a> saw an all-time revenue record for the September quarter.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>iPhone Sales</h2><br/>
<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> revenue was up during the quarter, coming in at &#36;43.8 billion, up from &#36;42.6 billion in the year-ago quarter. &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; revenue was down for the year, though, at &#36;200.6 billion, down from &#36;205.5 billion last year.<br/>
<br/>
Apple's &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; revenue set a September quarter revenue record.<br/>
<br/>
According to Apple CEO &zwnj;Tim Cook&zwnj;, the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a> models sold better than the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-14/">iPhone 14</a> models, but supplies of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a> and Pro Max were constrained, which impacted Apple's total &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; revenue.<br/>
<br/>
Cook said that Apple is "working hard" to make more &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; and Pro Max devices, and that the company expects to reach supply/demand balance at the end of the holiday quarter. &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; revenue is expected to grow year-over-year in the December quarter.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Mac Sales</h2><br/>
Mac sales <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/02/mac-revenue-down-m3-sales-improvements/">were way down</a> in Q4 2023, with Macs bringing in &#36;7.6 billion, down 34 percent &#36;11.5 billion in the year-ago quarter. Mac revenue for all of 2023 was &#36;29.4 billion, down from &#36;40.2 billion in 2022.<br/>
<br/>
Last year, September Mac sales were up because of supply chain issues in June, a situation that Apple could not compete with this year. Cook expects Mac revenue to improve next quarter thanks to the October introduction of the M3 Macs, and he said that the negative 34 percent growth should not be seen as representative of the underlying performance of the Mac.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>iPad Sales</h2><br/>
<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> sales did not fare quite as badly as Mac sales, but &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; revenue was also down. The &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; category brought in &#36;6.4 billion, down from &#36;7.1 billion in the year-ago quarter. Apple has not released any new iPads this year, so the drop in &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; revenue does not come as a surprise.<br/>
<br/>
Across 2023, &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; revenue came in at &#36;28.3 billion, down from &#36;29.3 billion in 2022. Apple CFO Luca Maestri said that year over year performance for the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; will "decelerate significantly" because of changes in product launch timing. Apple last year launched a new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a> during the December quarter, and no new iPads are planned in 2023.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Wearables, Home and Accessories</h2><br/>
Wearables revenue dropped as well, coming in at &#36;9.32 billion for the quarter, down from &#36;9.65 billion in the year-ago quarter. Wearable revenue for 2022 was at &#36;39.9 billion, down from &#36;41.2 billion last year.<br/>
<br/>
Year over year revenue for the wearables category is expected to drop in the December quarter.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Research and Development Spending</h2><br/>
Apple spent a total of &#36;30 billion on research and development in 2023, up from &#36;26.3 billion in 2022. Apple CEO &zwnj;Tim Cook&zwnj; said that Apple's increased spending is due to Vision Pro, AI, machine learning, and silicon investments.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Active Install Base</h2><br/>
Apple CFO Luca Maestri said that Apple's active installed base of devices has hit a new all-time high across all products and all of Apple's geographic segments.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Vision Pro</h2><br/>
Apple CEO &zwnj;Tim Cook&zwnj; was asked whether he thinks the Vision Pro launch and consumer education process will ultimately be similar to the AirPods and Apple Watch, but he said no, because of the purchasing experience.<blockquote>"I would say no. There's never been a product like the Vision Pro, so we're purposely bringing it out in our stores only so we can really put a great deal of attention on the last mile of it. We'll be offering demos in the stores and it'll be a very different process than a normal grab-and-go kind of process."</blockquote>Cook went on to say that Apple is seeing a "tremendous amount of excitement around Vision Pro." Cook has tested some of the apps that developers are working on, and he claims that some "real blow away kind of things are coming out."<br/>
<br/>
The Vision Pro will be sold solely in the United States to begin with, and Cooks comments suggest that customers might be required to visit a retail store to make a purchase. Apple's Vision Pro website says that the headset will be available for purchase both online and in retail stores, but Apple could ask customers to come to a retail store to pick up an online purchase in order to ensure a proper fit.<br/>
<br/>
<em>Bloomberg</em>'s <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a> <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/22/apple-to-host-secretive-vision-pro-training-event/">recently said</a> that Apple will assemble Vision Pro headsets for customers in its stores, giving each user the appropriate headband, light seal, and prescription lenses if necessary.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Generative AI</h2><br/>
Cook was asked how Apple might be able to monetize generative AI, which he of course declined to comment on, but he said that Apple is "investing quite a bit" in AI and that there are going to be product advancements <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/02/tim-cook-generative-ai-comments/">that involve generative AI</a> in the future.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Apple silicon</h2><br/>
An analyst asked Cook if it would ever be feasible for Apple to purchase "from the industry." Cook said that Apple silicon is "at the heart of the primary technologies" that Apple likes to control in its devices, and so he does not see the company "going back to buying off of the shelf."<br/>
<br/>
"I am happier today than I was yesterday than I was last week that we made the transition that we've made and I see the benefit every day of it," said Cook.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Apple's Search Deal With Google</h2><br/>
Cook was asked to comment on its web search partners, with a specific focus on the ongoing antitrust lawsuit that Google is facing from the U.S. Department of Justice.<br/>
<br/>
Cook said that Apple has "important relationships" with its web sear partners, but that he would not get into "commercial relationships" on the call. Cook said that he sees them "as important" and that Apple makes "decisions that we feel are in the best interests of our users."<br/>

Apple CEO <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tim-cook/">Tim Cook</a> was questioned about how Apple might be able to monetize generative AI, which he of course declined to comment on, but he said that Apple is "investing quite a bit" in AI and that there are going to be product advancements that involve generative AI.<br/>

<blockquote>If you zoom out and look at what we've done with AI and machine learning and how we've used it, these are fundamental technology integral to every product we ship.<br/>
<br/>
When we shipped iOS 17, it included features like Personal Voice and Live Voicemail. AI is at the heart of these features. You can go all the way to the life-saving features on the watch and phone, like Fall Detection, Crash Detection, and ECG on the watch. These would not be possible without AI. We don't label them as such, because we labeled them as to what their consumer benefit is, but the fundamental tech behind it is AI and machine learning.<br/>
<br/>
In terms of generative AI, we obviously have work going on. I'm not going to get into detail about it because we really don't do that, but you can bet we're investing. We're investing quite a bit. We're going to do it responsibly. You will see product advancements over time where those technologies are at the heart of it.</blockquote>Cook said that Apple is planning to be "responsible" when it delves into generative AI technology, and he suggested that features will roll out over time. Current rumors suggest that Apple's is planning <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/22/apple-generative-ai-features-and-smarter-siri/">some major AI updates</a> for 2024, some of which could use generative AI.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today shared its earnings results for the fourth fiscal quarter of 2023 (third calendar quarter), and Mac revenue saw a major drop compared to last year.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/m3-macbook-pro-blue.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-919851" /><br/>
Mac sales came in at &#36;7.6 billion in Q4 2023, down 34 percent from &#36;11.5 billion in the year-ago quarter. Mac revenue for all of 2023 was &#36;29.4 billion, down from &#36;40.2 billion in 2022.<br/>
<br/>
Apple CFO Luca Maestri attributed the drop to challenging market conditions and challenging compares to last year's Mac lineup. Because of supply chain issues during the June 2022 quarter, Mac sales spiked in the September 2022 quarter, which did not happen this year. Apple also updated the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/">MacBook Air</a> in June 2023 rather than September, which impacted September quarter sales compared to last year.<br/>
<br/>
Apple did release new M3, M3 Pro, and M3 Max Macs in late October, but sales of those devices will be reflected in the December quarter. Apple CEO <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tim-cook/">Tim Cook</a> told <em><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/11/02/apple-aapl-earnings-report-q4-2023.html">CNBC</a></em> that he expects Mac performance to improve over the holidays.<br/>
<br/>
"I think the Mac is going to have a significantly better quarter in the December quarter," said Cook. "We've got the M3, we've got the new products, and we don't have the compare phenomenon on a year-over-year basis," Cook said.<br/>
<br/>
Apple began allowing customers to purchase the new M3 Macs on Monday, with shipments to begin arriving next week. Apple appears to have plenty of supply of the new models, so there should be no supply constraints during the upcoming holidays.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/earnings/">Earnings</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/02/mac-revenue-down-m3-sales-improvements/">Mac Revenue Down 34% Year-Over-Year, But Tim Cook Expects &#039;Significant&#039; Improvement With M3 Macs</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/mac-revenue-down-34-year-over-year-but-tim-cook-expects-significant-improvement-with-m3-macs.2409676/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2023/11/apple-reports-fourth-quarter-results/">announced</a> financial results for the fourth fiscal quarter of 2023, which corresponds to the third calendar quarter of the year.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/aapl-4q23-line.jpg" alt="" width="1780" height="806" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-920526" /><br/>
For the quarter, Apple posted revenue of &#36;89.5 billion and net quarterly profit of &#36;23.0 billion, or &#36;1.46 per diluted share, compared to revenue of &#36;90.1 billion and net quarterly profit of &#36;20.7 billion, or &#36;1.29 per diluted share, in the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/10/27/apple-4q-2022-earnings/">year-ago quarter</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Gross margin for the quarter was 45.2 percent, compared to 42.3 percent in the year-ago quarter. Apple also declared a quarterly dividend payment of &#36;0.24 per share, payable on November 16 to shareholders of record as of November 13.<br/>
<br/>
For the full fiscal year, Apple recorded &#36;383.3 billion in sales and &#36;97.0 billion in net income, down slightly from &#36;394.3 billion in sales and &#36;99.8 billion in net income for fiscal 2022.<blockquote>"Today Apple is pleased to report a September quarter revenue record for iPhone and an all-time revenue record in Services," said Tim Cook, Apple's CEO. "We now have our strongest lineup of products ever heading into the holiday season, including the iPhone 15 lineup and our first carbon neutral Apple Watch models, a major milestone in our efforts to make all Apple products carbon neutral by 2030."</blockquote>As has been the case for over three years now, Apple is once again not issuing guidance for the current quarter ending in December.<br/>
<br/>

<b>2:17 pm</b>: "Mac revenue was &#36;7.6 billion, down 34% year over year, driven by challenging market conditions and compounded by a difficult compare in our own business. Last year, we experienced supply disruptions from factory shutdowns in the June quarter, and were subsequently able to fulfill a significant pent-up demand during the September quarter. We also had a difference in launch timing with the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/">MacBook Air</a> launching earlier this year in the June quarter compared to the September quarter last year."<br/>

We also expect to grow after normalizing for both last-year supply disruptions and the one extra week, we expect Mac year-over-year performance to significantly accelerate from the September quarter. <br/>
<br/>
We expect the year-over-year revenue performance for both &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; and Wearables, Home and Accessories to decelerate significantly from the September quarter due to a different timing of product launches on &zwnj;iPad&zwnj;. We launched a new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a> and &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; next-generation during the December quarter a year ago. Last year we had the full December quarter benefit from the launches of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/">AirPods Pro</a> 2nd Gen, the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch-se/">Apple Watch SE</a> and the first Apple Watch Ultra."<br/>
<br/>
<b>2:26 pm</b>: We're moving to the Q&A section.<br/>
<br/>
<b>2:26 pm</b>: Q: On &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; storage and demand versus &zwnj;iCloud&zwnj;. As demand for storage grows, are you seeing a mix shift towards higher storage &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; models, or are consumers mostly opting for the same because of increased uptake of &zwnj;iCloud&zwnj;+? What are some of the strategic and financial considerations here and trade-offs as you think about the mix shift towards higher storage models versus &zwnj;iCloud&zwnj; penetration?<br/>
<br/>
<b>2:27 pm</b>: A: We started the line with the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; Pro Max at 256GB, and so we are seeing a different mix, if you will, this year than last year. Outside of that, not significant, significant changes."<br/>
<br/>
<b>2:29 pm</b>: Q: Could you talk a little bit about the market conditions on notebooks and desktops, and then any color that you can share regarding the timing of the Mac through M3 MacBook Pros this year versus the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m2/">M2</a> earlier in the calendar year.<br/>
<br/>
A: We're thrilled to have announced M3 lineup. Get the new MacBook Pro and the new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/">iMac</a> out there. <br/>
<br/>
We anticipate a significant acceleration in Mac for Q1. In the year-ago June quarter, we had a factory disruption that lasted several weeks. The pent-up demand that resulted from that was filled in September quarter. And that made the September quarter not only record but a substantial record and obviously, we're now comparing against that for 2023 and I wouldn't look at the negative 34% growth as representative of the underlying business performance."<br/>
<br/>
<b>2:31 pm</b>: Q: Could you help us characterize what the demand environment you're seeing in China looks like, how has the reception been to the &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; and how would you characterize the mix within China as you go through this current product cycle?<br/>
<br/>
A: One thing to keep in mind here is that the FX impact was nearly six points. So we grew in constant currency and underneath that, if you look at the different categories, &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; actually set a September quarter record, and in mainland China, what pulled down the performance was a combination largely of Mac and &zwnj;iPad&zwnj;. Services also grew during the quarter and the Mac and &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; suffered from the same issues that the company did with the compare issues to 2022."<br/>
<br/>
<b>2:33 pm</b>: Q: As we move towards more of an inflationary component pricing environment, how do we think about that effect or how you're thinking about the gross margin at the product level? <br/>
<br/>
As maybe component pricing starts to turn what has been clearly very favorable over the last several quarters to more of an inflationary environment. <br/>
<br/>
A: Well as you've seen from our results in Q4 and the guidance for Q1, we're obviously experiencing very strong levels of gross margin.  The 45.2 was a record for this September quarter. And then you know the guidance for Q1 is obviously strong at 45 to 46%. Gross margins are affected by multiple factors. Obviously, the commodity environment is one of them. as you mentioned. It's been a good environment In recent quarters, But equally important is the mix of what we sell. Growth in services for us is favorable and that has helped our company gross margin. Foreign exchange, on the other hand, has been a drag for several quarters given the strength of the dollar.<br/>
<br/>
<b>2:33 pm</b>: Q: I know that the &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; and Pro Max are constrained today but I think some of your comments suggests you shouldn't be back to supply-demand balance before quarter end. Does your December quarter revenue guidance account for any supply constraints? And if so, is there any way to kind of quantify how much supply would be limiting your December quarter revenue performance?<br/>
<br/>
A: We are constrained today on &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; Max. We're working very hard to get the product in the hands of all the customers that have ordered it. We expect, as of today, that we're going to be in supply-demand balance by the end of the quarter, so the guidance reflects that.<br/>
<br/>
<b>2:35 pm</b>: Q: You've been on the leading edge of innovation across hardware, software, and services, and technologies and kind of longer-term projects that you're investing in. How should we think about your capital intensity as we look to fiscal year 2024, as over the last few years, capex as a percentage of revenue has been relatively low compared to the eight years prior.<br/>
<br/>
Should we expect a step up in capital-investment intensity and what are the more notable moving pieces that we should be thinking about?<br/>
<br/>
A: The big areas of investment for us are tooling and equipment for manufacturing plants, our investments in data centers, and our investments in our own facilities, both corporate facilities and retail stores. <br/>
<br/>
And so both for the tooling in our plants and you know, our data center investments, we tend to have a bit of a hybrid model where we share some of the investments with our partners, and suppliers. So maybe that's why you see sometimes a bit of variability. But over the last few years, we made all the investments that we need to make and we're planning to make all the investments that we believe are needed and appropriate in order to continue to innovate.<br/>
<br/>
<b>2:38 pm</b>: Q: &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; business looks like it returned to growth in the quarter. But it's still relatively softer than where I would thought it would be at this point in the cycle. Some of the US carriers obviously haven't been particularly aggressive in promoting upgrades. I wanted to kind of get a sense from your partners in the US currently and going forward and what do you expect on upgrades?<br/>
<br/>
Is it fair to say that the mix in Q1 from a product versus services dynamic is kind of the key driver of the better gross margin guide as a whole relative to the December quarter, or is there anything else? I know you mentioned there's a lot of moving pieces, but is that the primary driver of the uplift in the margins?<br/>
<br/>
A: On the US carriers and the US business in general, it's really too early to call the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; cycle, particularly with the constraint around the Pro and Pro Max in the US tends to do quite well with those products. It's really too early to tell what the upgrade rates will be and what the switcher rates will be. <br/>
<br/>
December is the quarter where our products business is tends to be very heavy because of the holiday season and so the Services gross margin has an impact but not as meaningful as other quarters during the year. And so I think that the the main drivers of the guidance that we provided are the fact that we are seeing improved costs and improved margin on the product side of the business, partially offset by foreign exchange which continues to be a drag both sequentially and on a year-over-year basis.<br/>
<br/>
<b>2:40 pm</b>: Q: The Services growth rate was a tremendous acceleration in September quarter to 16% growth. Can you talk about what is driving this acceleration? Are there a couple of products that have stepped up in a very meaningful way? What is driving the situation? It's very notable compared to what you've been seeing the last few quarters.<br/>
<br/>
A: We had a really strong quarter across the board both geographically and from a product category standpoint. We had all-time records for the &zwnj;App Store&zwnj;, for advertising, for &zwnj;iCloud&zwnj;, video, &zwnj;AppleCare&zwnj;, and payments, and a September quarter record for Music, so it's hard to pick one in particular because they all did well.<br/>
<br/>
<b>2:42 pm</b>: Q: About Vision Pro, which I believe is supposed to be launched more broadly sometime in 2024 in the early part of the year. <br/>
<br/>
I'm curious how different you think the launch and the consumer education of this product. How will it be versus other things like AirPods or Apple Watch that you've done, and then perhaps what has stood out to you from the developers that have been able to use this and the developer labs, what feedback have you gotten from them?<br/>
<br/>
A: There's a tremendous amount of excitement around the Vision Pro and we've been very happy to share it with developers. We have Developer Labs set up in different parts of the world so that they can actually get their hands on it and are working on apps, and I've been fortunate enough to see a number of those. To answer your question about is it similar to AirPods or Apple Watch? I would say no. There's never been a product like Vision Pro and so we're purposely bringing it out in our stores only so we can put a great deal of attention on the last mile of it. We'll be offering demos in the stores and it'll be a very different process than the normal grab-and-go kind of purchase.<br/>
<br/>
<b>2:44 pm</b>: Q: Lots of companies are experimenting with generative AI. I'm curious about what kind of efforts you have made, I was curious about if you can give us a glimpse on how you might be able to monetize some of these efforts with generative AI.<br/>
<br/>
A: If you zoom out and look at what we've done on AI and machine learning and how we've used it, we view AI and machine learning as fundamental technologies, and they're integral to virtually every product that we ship. <br/>
<br/>
When we shipped &zwnj;iOS 17&zwnj;, it had features like personal voice and live voicemail. AI is at the heart of these features and then you can go all the way to the life-saving features on the watch and the phone, like fall detection, crash detection. ECG on the watch. These would not be possible without AI.<br/>
<br/>
We don't label them as such, we labeled them as to what their consumer benefit is. But the fundamental technology behind it is is AI and machine learning. In terms of generative AI, we have obviously we have work going on but I'm not going to get into details about what it is because as you know, we don't we really don't do that. <br/>
<br/>
But you can bet that we're investing quite a bit. We're going to do it responsibly.<br/>
<br/>
<b>2:47 pm</b>: Q: Over the last decade, you can source a lot of important chips in your iPhones, in Macs, in iPads, and so forth. Now we see these silicon guys, the chip guys, moving to ARM architecture. So my question to you is, for silicon in general, is it an economically profitable proposition for Apple or as a strategic one for you to own this? And is it vital to your products for the consumer experience or could you buy from the industry?<br/>
<br/>
A: Apple silicon has really enabled us to build products that we could not build without doing it ourselves. We like to own the primary technologies in the products that we ship. And arguably Apple silicon is at the heart of the primary technologies. And so no, I don't see going back to buying off the shelf. I am happier today than I was yesterday than I was last week that we made the transition that we've made and I see the benefit every day of it.<br/>
<br/>
<b>2:49 pm</b>: Q: You obviously had a great Services quarter and part of your Services business has these licensing relationships. <br/>
<br/>
On web search partners, you serve a very important distribution function for them. Can you talk about how you think about these relationships and potentially some of the options Apple has to mitigate some of the risks, given some of the scrutiny on what some of these search partners are doing?<br/>
<br/>
A: They are important relationships, and as you know, we don't get into our commercial relationships in the call.  I see them as important, and we make decisions that we feel are in the best interests of our users.<br/>
<br/>
<b>2:51 pm</b>: Q: Is there room for margin expansion? As revenue has declined, gross margins have improved.<br/>
<br/>
A: On the product side, when we launch new products, the cost structures of those products tend to be higher than the products that they replace. <br/>
<br/>
It happens because we're always adding new technologies and new features. And then we work through the cost curve over the over the lifecycle of the product and we tend to get benefits as time goes by. The guidance that we provided for December reflects all that and so we are starting from a different position than a year ago or in the past in general. <br/>
<br/>
There are other factors that play a role. For example, the mix of products that we sell. Not every product has the same gross margin profile. And so our guidance our results are reflective of that and also within a specific product category. A lot depends on the kind of models that we sell because they are different margin profiles.<br/>
<br/>
I think one of the things that we've done well over the last few years is to offer more affordability solutions to our customers in the form of installment plans, trade-in options and low cost financing in general. And what that has accomplished is reduced the affordability threshold for our customers and therefore they can you know buy at the top of our product ranges. That has been a big factor in the reason for our margin expansion.<br/>
<br/>
<b>2:53 pm</b>: Q: Seeing amazing momentum in India. How do you look at look at the India growth opportunity on these hardware units? How should we think about ASP versus the rest of the geographies and is there a way to compare and contrast India with China?<br/>
<br/>
A: This is China maybe a decade ago. We had an all-time revenue record in India, we grossed very strong double digits. It's an incredibly exciting market for us, and a major focus of ours. We have small share in a large market and so it would seem that there's a lot of headroom there.<br/>
<br/>
The ASPs, I haven't looked at them recently but I'm sure that they're lower than worldwide. <br/>
<br/>
In terms of the similarity, I would say each country has its own journey and I wouldn't want to play the comparison game but we see an extraordinary market with a lot of people moving into the middle class. Distribution is getting better. We put two retail stores there and they're doing better than we anticipated. It's still early going, but they're off to a good start and I couldn't be happier with how things are going at the moment.<br/>
<br/>
<b>2:56 pm</b>: Q: I appreciate all your commentary around China. It was great to kind of hear about the growth potential there and your optimism. What about the supply chain and where is your priority? Do you have a priority to diversify your supply chain and how do you feel about Apple's supply chain around the world in particular, what do you think about the investments in the US?<br/>
<br/>
A: You know, our supply chain is truly global. We're investing all over the world, including in the United States. We were very focused on advanced manufacturing for the US and we've worked on a number of different projects in the US, whether it's our venture with Corning on the glass, the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mask-face-id/">Face ID</a> module, or semiconductors. And so all of these are our advanced manufacturing and I think they're exactly the kinds of things that you would think the US would be very good at. <br/>
<br/>
We also invest in other regions of the world and we're continually optimizing the chain. At the moment we learn something didn't work exactly right, we're tweaking it. And so we're we're gonna continue to do that. But at the end of the day, it will still be a global supply chain.<br/>
<br/>
<b>2:58 pm</b>: Q: Really quick on the extra week dynamic. There was, last year, an issue with the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; production when there were the COVID lockdowns in China. Is it possible to give some color around what having a normalized supply chain somewhat this year?<br/>
<br/>
A: The extra week is seven points of revenue. We did have supply disruptions last year on the phone. And then the 14th week in the December quarter a year ago. <br/>
<br/>
When we normalize for those two factors, and I said it during the call, we still expect to grow on &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;. You take into account the loss of a week, you compare it with supply disruptions that are not going to repeat hopefully this year, and when you normalize for those two things, we still expect to grow on &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
<b>2:59 pm</b>: Q: Where is the growth in R&D coming from? Is that Vision Pro or content or new services?<br/>
<br/>
A: It's Vision Pro, it's AI and ML. It's the silicon investment that we're making. It's sort of all of those things, and I think you would find that the R&D expenditure in the aggregate looks very competitive versus others. Some of the investments that we're making in R&D are also the drivers for the gross margin expansion. I think it's important to think about it that way.<br/>
<br/>
<b>3:02 pm</b>: Q: Tim mentioned college students choosing Macs and you mentioned the record Services revenue. What metrics do you think you could provide to help investors understand how Apple measures customer lifetime value, especially when we see a lot of users entering the ecosystem with a relatively lower price products or even refurbished devices? You're growing your ecosystem, but how do you think about growing customer lifetime value over the long run? <br/>
<br/>
A: We want to make sure that you know the customers that we acquire remain with us. We pay a lot of attention to the behavior of the install base, both by product and by geography. Then we look at the daily engagement in the ecosystem. That's why we pay a lot of attention to things like transacting accounts, paid accounts. We want to see if we are able to move our customers from a free model to a paid model over time. That's obviously very, very important for us. <br/>
<br/>
We keep track of all these things and, you know, then what we do, because I think what's really important is that over time we add new services. The progress that we made in payments in recent years is very important because we've attracted more people that are actually now using additional features on our devices and we are able to monetize that.<br/>
<br/>
We take all that into account. We understand what happens when a customer joins us, when they buy a primary device versus a used device. We understand their behavior in different markets and so on. We have pretty good visibility and I think the progress that we're making in Services, with &#36;85 billion in the last 12 months, that's the size of a Fortune 50. Significantly bigger than it was just a couple of years ago.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple appears to be internally testing an iOS 17.1.1 update for the iPhone, based on evidence of the software in our website's analytics logs this week.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/iOS-17.1.1-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-920500" /><br/>
iOS 17.1.1 will almost certainly be focused on bug fixes, but it's unclear exactly which issues the update will address. The update could include the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/30/ios-17-2-beta-addresses-wifi-issues/">same fix for Wi-Fi connectivity issues</a> that Apple rolled out in the first iOS 17.2 beta, and it could resolve an issue where <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/18/ios-17-1-shutdown-bug-no-fix/">some iPhones temporarily shut off overnight</a> for users still experiencing that. Apple also <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/25/apple-to-fix-iphone-15-bmw-charging-issue/">promised to fix a BMW wireless charging issue</a> affecting the iPhone 15 lineup in an update later this year, but it remains to be seen if that fix will be included in iOS 17.1.1.<br/>
<br/>
It's unclear when iOS 17.1.1 will be released to the public, but our best guess is that the update will be available within the next week or two.<br/>
<br/>
iOS 17.2 remains in beta testing, and is expected to be released in December, so iOS 17.1.1 will be a stopgap update. iOS 17.2 includes <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/26/ios-17-2-beta-1-features/">many new features and changes</a>, including the promised Journal app, the ability for Apple Music subscribers to collaborate on playlists, a Translate option for the Action button on iPhone 15 Pro models, an iMessage Contact Key Verification security option, additional Weather and Clock widgets, and more.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-17/">iPadOS 17</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-17.241">iOS 17</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-17.242">iPadOS 17</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/02/ios-17-1-1-is-coming/">Apple Preparing to Release iOS 17.1.1 Update for iPhone</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-preparing-to-release-ios-17-1-1-update-for-iphone.2409666/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Now that we're in November, Black Friday season is already upon us. The shopping holiday doesn't technically take place for another three weeks, on Friday, November 24, but that never stops retailers from kicking off early Black Friday deals.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/best-early-black-friday-deals.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-920468" /><em><small>Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with some of these vendors. When you click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment, which helps us keep the site running.</small></em><br/>
<br/>
Because of this, we're highlighting all of the best early markdowns on Apple products and related accessories that you can already buy today. Some of the best include low prices on AirPods Pro 2 with USB-C, MacBook Air, iPad, and more. More information on these sales can be found in our <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/black-friday/"><strong>Black Friday Roundup</strong></a>.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Macs equipped with the standard M3 chip still support only one external display with up to 6K resolution at 60Hz, according to <a href="https://www.apple.com/macbook-pro/specs/">Apple's tech specs</a>. So far, the chip is available in the entry-level 14-inch MacBook Pro and the 24-inch iMac.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/05/Pro-Display-XDR-Red.jpg" alt="" width="2590" height="1456" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-743452" /><br/>
This limitation has existed since the first Apple silicon Macs with the M1 chip were released in 2020, but users can connect multiple external displays to M1, M2, and M3 Macs with DisplayLink adapters as an unofficial workaround. One exception is the Mac mini, which will likely be updated with the M3 chip next year and should retain support for up to two external displays, given that it lacks a built-in display.<br/>
<br/>
The higher-end 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models support up to two external displays with the M3 Pro chip, and up to four with the M3 Max chip.<br/>
<br/>
M3 chip display support:<blockquote>One external display with up to 6K resolution at 60Hz</blockquote>M3 Pro chip display support:<blockquote>Up to two external displays with up to 6K resolution at 60Hz over Thunderbolt, or one external display with up to 6K resolution at 60Hz over Thunderbolt and one external display with up to 4K resolution at 144Hz over HDMI<br/>
<br/>
One external display supported at 8K resolution at 60Hz or one external display at 4K resolution at 240Hz over HDMI</blockquote><br/>
<br/>
M3 Max chip display support:<blockquote>Up to four external displays: Up to three external displays with 6K resolution at 60Hz over Thunderbolt and one external display with up to 4K resolution at 144Hz over HDMI<br/>
<br/>
Up to three external displays: Up to two external displays with 6K resolution at 60Hz over Thunderbolt and one external display with up to 8K resolution at 60Hz or one external display with 4K resolution at 240Hz over HDMI</blockquote>The new MacBook Pro models are now available to order, and most configurations will begin arriving to customers and launch in stores on Tuesday, November 7. M3 Max configurations will be available later in November.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m3/">M3</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/02/m3-chip-still-supports-one-external-display/">Macs With M3 Chip Still Officially Support Only a Single External Display</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/macs-with-m3-chip-still-officially-support-only-a-single-external-display.2409623/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple has <a href="https://twitter.com/iSpeedtestOS/status/1719974953842348434">stopped signing iOS 17.0.3</a>, preventing iPhone users from downgrading to that version. However, Apple continues to sign iOS 17.0.2 for now.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/iOS-17.0.3-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-915213" /><br/>
Apple routinely stops signing older iOS releases over time in order to prevent users from downgrading to previous software versions.<br/>
<br/>
iOS 17.1 is currently the newest version available to the public, while iOS 17.2 is in beta testing and is expected to be released in December.<br/>
<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/">iMac</a> now features the M3 chip, replacing the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m1/">M1</a> model that Apple introduced in April 2021, so how different are the two successive generations?<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/M1-versus-M3-iMac-Feature-1.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-920212" /><br/>
The 2021 &zwnj;iMac&zwnj; was the first of its kind to feature an Apple silicon chip, replacing previous Intel-based models with 21.5- and 27-inch displays. It offered an all-new ultra-thin design, a 24-inch Retina display, a six-speaker system with force-cancelling woofers, and an array of seven two-tone color options. The 2021 &zwnj;iMac&zwnj; has now been discontinued by Apple and prices at third-party resellers are falling. As such, some customers may be weighing up whether to upgrade to a 2021 or 2023 &zwnj;iMac&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
The two Apple silicon &zwnj;iMac&zwnj; models share the overwhelming majority of their features, so should you consider buying or sticking with the first-generation to save money? This breakdown also serves as a way to see all the differences that the 2023 &zwnj;iMac&zwnj; brings to the table.<br/>

<br/>
Overall, the 2023 &zwnj;iMac&zwnj; is a very minor upgrade over the 2021 model, with the M3 chip being the most significant change. As a result, it is difficult to recommend upgrading from an &zwnj;M1&zwnj; model unless you specifically need better performance, hardware-accelerated graphics, or a larger quantity of memory. The new &zwnj;iMac&zwnj; is up to 2x faster than the prior generation with the &zwnj;M1&zwnj; chip, according to Apple, meaning that it should deliver a considerable performance improvement for those who need it.<br/>
<br/>
Most users of the &zwnj;M1&zwnj; &zwnj;iMac&zwnj; will not be able to justify upgrading to the M3 &zwnj;iMac&zwnj;, but customers coming from an older Intel-based machine or those who do not have one at all could still have good reason to prefer the latest model. For those upgrading from an Intel-based ‌&zwnj;iMac&zwnj;‌, Apple says that the new ‌&zwnj;iMac&zwnj;‌ is up to 2.5x faster than previous 27-inch models and 4.5x faster than previous 21.5-inch models.<br/>
<br/>
The 2023 &zwnj;iMac&zwnj; is otherwise very similar to the 2021 model, so some customers who have very basic needs and are interested in buying an &zwnj;iMac&zwnj; may prefer to look for a discounted 2021 model. The &zwnj;iMac&zwnj; is priced starting at &#36;1,299, so if you are not interested in its new features and can find the original model for substantially less, it may be worth getting that instead. Even so, it should be remembered that this is a much older model; the M3 model will be more future-proof and capable in the long term.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/">iMac</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iMac">iMac (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/imac.91">iMac</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m1-vs-m3-imac/">M1 vs. M3 iMac Buyer&#039;s Guide: 15+ Differences Compared</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/m1-vs-m3-imac-buyers-guide-15-differences-compared.2409603/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The first benchmark results for Apple's M3 Max chip <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/17lr5ck/m3_max_first_geekbench_6_results/">surfaced</a> in the <a href="https://browser.geekbench.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=mac15%2C9">Geekbench 6 database</a> today, providing a look at CPU performance. Based on the "Mac15,9" model identifier shown, the results <a href="https://twitter.com/aaronp613/status/1719775450963095885">appear to be</a> for the new 16-inch MacBook Pro.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/M3-Max-Chip.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="895" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-920348" /><br/>
The highest multi-core score for the M3 Max with a 16-core CPU is currently 21,084 as of writing. If this early result is accurate, this means the M3 Max is around as fast as the M2 Ultra chip, which has an average multi-core score of 21,182 in the Mac Pro and 21,316 in the Mac Studio, according to a <a href="https://browser.geekbench.com/mac-benchmarks">chart on the Geekbench website</a>.<br/>
<br/>
The M3 Max in the new 16-inch MacBook Pro is around 45% faster than the M2 Max chip in the previous-generation 16-inch MacBook Pro, according to the Geekbench website. This is within the ballpark of Apple's claim that the M3 Max is up to 50% faster than the M2 Max, especially given variance in early Geekbench results.<br/>
<br/>
Geekbench 6 multi-core scores for CPU performance:<ul><li>M2 Ultra: 21,182 (Mac Pro, averaged)</li><br/>
<li><strong>M3 Max: 21,084 (16-inch MacBook Pro, highest score listed so far)</strong></li><br/>
<li>M2 Max: 14,495 (16-inch MacBook Pro, averaged)</li><br/>
<li>M1 Max: 12,185 (16-inch MacBook Pro, averaged)</li><br/>
<li>M3: 11,836 (14-inch MacBook Pro, highest score listed so far)</li></ul>Manufactured with TSMC's 3nm process, the M3 Max has up to a 16-core CPU with 12 performance cores and four efficiency cores. It also has up to a 40-core GPU and can be configured with up to 128GB of unified memory.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/M3-Max-Specs.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="895" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-920350" /><br/>
The new 16-inch MacBook Pro starts at &#36;3,499 in the U.S. when configured with the M3 Max chip, while the Mac Studio with the M2 Ultra chip starts at &#36;3,999, so you can effectively get the same performance for &#36;500 less with the new 16-inch MacBook Pro, and do not need to supply your own display, keyboard, and mouse.<br/>
<br/>
The first Geekbench 6 results for the standard M3 chip <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/01/m3-chip-benchmark-results/">surfaced earlier today</a>, revealing that it is up to 20% faster than the standard M2 chip. Benchmarks provide a useful reference point, but real-world performance can vary.<br/>
<br/>
The new MacBook Pro models are now available to order, and most configurations will begin arriving to customers and launch in stores on Tuesday, November 7. M3 Max configurations will be available later in November.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro/">MacBook Pro 14 & 16" </a></div><div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/earnings/">Earnings</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/geekbench/">Geekbench</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m3/">M3</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Pro_16">14" & 16" MacBook Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macbook-pro.90">MacBook Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/01/m3-max-chip-benchmark-results/">M3 Max Chip Around as Fast as M2 Ultra in Early Benchmark Results</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/m3-max-chip-around-as-fast-as-m2-ultra-in-early-benchmark-results.2409580/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today <a href="https://developer.apple.com/safari/download/">released a new update</a> for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/safari-technology-preview/">Safari Technology Preview</a>, the experimental browser Apple <a href="http://www.macrumors.com/2016/03/30/apple-safari-technology-preview-browser/">first introduced</a> in March 2016. Apple designed the &zwnj;Safari Technology Preview&zwnj; to test features that may be introduced into future release versions of Safari.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-785724" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/02/Safari-Technology-Preview-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2368" height="1332" /><br/>
&zwnj;Safari Technology Preview&zwnj; 182 includes fixes and updates for CSS, Forms, HTML, JavaScript, Loading, Media, Rendering, Scrolling, Storage, SVG, Text, Web API, Web Assembly, Web Inspector, and WebRTC.<br/>
<br/>
The current &zwnj;Safari Technology Preview&zwnj; release is compatible with machines running macOS Ventura and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sonoma/">macOS Sonoma</a>, the latest version of macOS that Apple released in September 2023. <br/>
<br/>
The &zwnj;Safari Technology Preview&zwnj; update is available through the Software Update mechanism in System Preferences or System Settings to anyone who has <a href="https://developer.apple.com/safari/download/">downloaded the browser</a>. Full release notes for the update are available <a href="https://developer.apple.com/safari/technology-preview/release-notes/">on the Safari Technology Preview website</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Apple's aim with &zwnj;Safari Technology Preview&zwnj; is to gather feedback from developers and users on its browser development process. &zwnj;Safari Technology Preview&zwnj; can run side-by-side with the existing Safari browser and while designed for developers, it does not require a developer account to download.<br/>

Apple's CEO Tim Cook and CFO Luca Maestri will discuss the results on a conference call with analysts a half hour later.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/iPhone-15-Pro-lineup.jpg" alt="" width="2880" height="1620" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-910338" /><br/>
Keep reading for some key things to know about the quarter, including a recap of new products announced, revenue expectations, and more.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>New Products During Quarter</h2><br/>
The quarter ran from ran from July 2 through September 30, according to Apple's fiscal calendar, and included the following product launches:<ul><li>iPhone 15, iPhone 15 Plus, iPhone 15 Pro, and iPhone 15 Pro Max</li><br/>
<li>Apple Watch Series 9 and Apple Watch Ultra 2</li><br/>
<li>AirPods Pro with USB-C charging case and EarPods with USB-C connector</li></ul><h2>Revenue Expectations</h2><br/>
Apple has not provided formal revenue guidance since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, but Wall Street expects the company to report revenue of &#36;89.28 billion in the fourth quarter, according <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/11/01/apple-q4-2023-earnings-preview-fourth-consecutive-sales-decline-expected.html">to <em>CNBC</em></a>. This would be around a 1% decline compared to the &#36;90.15 billion revenue the company reported in the year-ago quarter.<br/>
<br/>
Maestri provided the following commentary on Apple's earnings call last quarter:<blockquote>We expect our September quarter year-over-year revenue performance to be similar to the June quarter, assuming that the macroeconomic outlook doesn't worsen from what we are projecting today for the current quarter.</blockquote><h2>Conference Call</h2><br/>
Cook and Maestri will hold a conference call at 2:00 p.m. Pacific Time on Thursday to discuss the company's fourth quarter earnings results. The call should last around one hour and will include a Q&A segment with analysts.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple this week discontinued the 13-inch <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m2/">M2</a> MacBook Pro, replacing it with a 14-inch model that's equipped with a next-generation M3 chip. The 14-inch model is more expensive, but it comes with a number of benefits that make it worth the upgrade for anyone with a 13-inch machine. <br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/l3mBLetnQpk" title="Apple M3 14-Inch MacBook Pro vs M2 13-Inch MacBook Pro: Worth the Upgrade?" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe><em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/macrumors?sub_confirmation=1">Subscribe to the MacRumors YouTube channel</a> for more videos.</em></div><br/>
The 14-inch MacBook Pro has a larger display than the 13-inch model for more screen real estate, and it features much more modern-looking thin bezels. There's also a notch that houses the front-facing camera, a necessity for those slimmed down bezels. It is a mini-LED Liquid Retina XDR display, which is an upgrade over the LCD of the prior-generation 13-inch model. <br/>
<br/>
Along with support for 120Hz ProMotion refresh rates, the 14-inch MacBook Pro's display is brighter and has better color and HDR support. SDR brightness is 600 nits, while XDR brightness is 1000 nits sustained and 1600 nits peak.<br/>
<br/>
In terms of performance, you're going to see a boost in CPU and GPU speeds, but it will be most noticeable if you're coming from an Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m1/">M1</a> chip or an even earlier Intel chip. The M3 has an 8-core CPU and 10-core GPU much like the &zwnj;M2&zwnj;, but the GPU supports hardware-accelerated ray tracing so gameplay will be improved.<br/>
<br/>
Battery life has seen a boost, so the 14-inch MacBook Pro now lasts for up to 22 hours, up two hours from the 20 hour battery life of the &zwnj;M2&zwnj; 13-inch MacBook Pro. If you were a fan of the Touch Bar, be warned that the 14-inch MacBook Pro does not have one. With the discontinuation of the 13-inch MacBook Pro, Apple has officially nixed the Touch Bar. <br/>
<br/>
In terms of size, the 14-inch MacBook Pro is a little wider, a little longer, and just a bit heavier than the 13-inch model. It weighs 3.4 pounds while the 13-inch model weighed 3 pounds. There are more ports with the M3 MacBook Pro, so in addition to two Thunderbolt ports, you'll also get an HDMI port, an SD card slot, and a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe-battery-pack/">MagSafe</a> charging port. <br/>
<br/>
Other improvements include a better 1080p <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/facetime/">FaceTime</a> HD camera, a six-speaker sound system, Wi-Fi 6E support, and Bluetooth 5.3. <br/>
<br/>
The only real downside with the 14-inch MacBook Pro is the price. It starts at &#36;1,599, making it &#36;300 more expensive than the &#36;1,299 starting price of the &zwnj;M2&zwnj; 13-inch MacBook Pro. If you can afford it, what you get for the extra &#36;300 is worth it, but if that makes it too pricey, you'll need to look at the lower-cost <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/">MacBook Air</a>. <br/>
<br/>
For those with an &zwnj;M2&zwnj; 13-inch MacBook Pro, it's probably not worth upgrading to the 14-inch model right now despite the benefits, but if you're coming from an &zwnj;M1&zwnj; 13-inch MacBook Pro or an Intel machine, it's going to be a much more notable upgrade that will feel closer to night and day.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[The lower-cost <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music-voice-plan/">Apple Music Voice Plan</a> is being discontinued this month in the U.S. and all other countries where it was available, according to an <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212798">Apple support document</a>. <a href="https://macmagazine.com.br/post/2023/11/01/silenciosamente-apple-mata-assinatura-voice-do-apple-music/">Brazilian website <em>MacMagazine</em></a> was first to alert us to this news.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/12/apple-music-voice-plan-feature-blue-green.jpg" alt="" width="1812" height="1020" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-830419" /><br/>
"Beginning in November, Apple will discontinue the Apple Music Voice plan," said Apple. "We are focused on delivering the best, most robust music experience possible for our customers, with features like immersive Spatial Audio, Apple Music Sing with real-time lyrics, intuitive browse and discovery features, and so much more."<br/>
<br/>
Apple said existing subscribers can continue to use the Voice Plan for the duration of their final billing cycle, but they will lose access after that period. It's unclear why the plan was discontinued, but Apple says other Apple Music plans "already work seamlessly with Siri, and we will continue to optimize this experience."<br/>
<br/>
Apple added that existing subscribers will receive a notification prior to the end of their final billing cycle with more information.<br/>
<br/>
Priced at &#36;4.99 per month in the U.S., the Voice Plan was designed to let users access Apple Music exclusively through Siri. The plan launched <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/12/14/ios-15-2-apple-music-voice-plan-video/">as part of iOS 15.2</a> in December 2021 in the U.S., Australia, Austria, Canada, China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, India, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Mexico, New Zealand, Spain, Taiwan, and the U.K.<br/>
<br/>
The primary way to subscribe to the Voice Plan was by asking Siri, and music playback was controlled via Siri too. While the plan provided access to the entire Apple Music catalog with over 100 million songs, it lacked some features available on more expensive plans, such as downloading, spatial audio, and Family Sharing.<br/>

The Macs will ship with a custom version of &zwnj;macOS Sonoma&zwnj; 14.1 with a build number of 23B2073, but new users will need to download and install a new version with a build number of 23B2077.<br/>
<br/>
Day one updates are not unusual for new devices as Apple often has to begin manufacturing with an older version of the software. Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/25/apple-releases-macos-sonoma-14-1/">first released macOS Sonoma 14.1</a> on Wednesday, October 25, and the current version has a build number of 23B74.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Introductory production on the standard <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> 17 will start in India in the second half of 2025, according to <a href="https://medium.com/@mingchikuo/iphone印度生產狀況更新-iphone-17-npi可能將在印度啟動-update-on-iphone-production-in-india-iphone-17-npi-likely-4088fb656708">Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo</a>. Kuo says that new product introduction (NPI) for the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 17 will happen in India, marking the first time that Apple begins development of a new &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; outside of China.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/08/apple-india.jpg" alt="" width="2304" height="1296" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-756076" /><br/>
Apple will opt to assemble the standard &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 17 in India because it has a "lower difficulty" design that will minimize risk. Apple has been manufacturing older iPhones and other devices in India since <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2017/02/02/apple-iphone-manufacturing-india-official/">for several years now</a> in an effort to move more of its manufacturing out of China. Apple has slowly started giving factories in India <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/09/26/apple-manufacturing-iphone-14-india/">more responsibility</a>, and began <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-14/">iPhone 14</a> production in the country just a few weeks after the device launched in September 2022. <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a> production started even earlier, with factories in the country assembling the base &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; model <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/16/new-iphone-starts-production-outside-china/">prior to launch</a>, but assembly still started in China first.<br/>
<br/>
Apple works with Foxconn, Pegatron, and Tata (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/tata-make-iphones-india-after-buying-wistron-business-2023-10-27/">new owner of Wistron</a>) to manufacture iPhones in India, with Foxconn handling 75 to 80 percent of the device assembly. Foxconn has invested more than &#36;500 million in India to ramp up its manufacturing capabilities.<br/>
<br/>
As of now, Kuo believes that 12 to 14 percent of global &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; shipments are made in India, with that proportion to increase to 20 to 25 percent by 2024. In addition to allowing Apple to move manufacturing away from China, increasing production in India provides Apple with an opportunity to strengthen its relationship with the Indian government. India is a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/08/apple-india-focus-international-sales/">key market for Apple</a> due to growing demand for Apple products in the country.<br/>
<br/>
Apple in 2023 opened its <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/11/apple-stores-india-wallpapers/">first retail stores in Mumbai</a>, but online sales have been <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2020/09/23/apple-online-store-india-launch/">available in India</a> since 2020.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/">Ming-Chi Kuo</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/india/">India</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/01/iphone-17-assembly-india/">iPhone 17 to Be Assembled in India as Apple Aims to Further Diversify Supply Chain</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-17-to-be-assembled-in-india-as-apple-aims-to-further-diversify-supply-chain.2409529/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The USB-C <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-pencil/">Apple Pencil</a> that Apple unveiled in October is <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2023/11/the-new-more-affordable-apple-pencil-is-now-available-to-order/">available for purchase starting today</a>. Priced at &#36;79, the &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; is compatible with all iPads that feature a USB-C port, and it serves as an alternative to the more expensive first and second-generation &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; models.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/Apple-Pencil-USB-C-sliding-cap-feature.jpg" alt="" width="1960" height="1102" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-917176" /><br/>
The &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; features a matte finish and a flat magnetic side to allow it to attach to an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> when not in use, plus there is a hidden USB-C port under the sliding cap for charging purposes. Unlike the &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; 2, it is not able to charge magnetically when attached to an &zwnj;iPad&zwnj;, and it is also lacking pressure sensitivity and support for tap gestures. <br/>
<br/>
Other &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; features such as low latency and tilt sensitivity are included, plus it supports the &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; Hover feature on compatible <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m2/">M2</a> <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a> models.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[A legal claim in the United Kingdom over Apple's 2017 "throttling" controversy has been allowed to move forward by the Competition Appeal Tribunal, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/mass-lawsuit-against-apple-over-iphone-batteries-can-go-ahead-london-tribunal-2023-11-01/">according to <em>Reuters</em></a>.<br/>

<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/iPhone-slow-16x9-yellow.jpg" alt="" width="1314" height="740" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-920127" /><br/>
Consumer advocate Justin Gutmann <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/06/16/uk-legal-claim-25-million-users-battery-throttling/">filed the claim back in June 2022,</a> originally seeking a total of £750 million for up to 25 million <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> users in the UK whose devices were affected by the issue, which stemmed from Apple's efforts to prevent devices with degraded batteries from unexpectedly shutting down while in use. The claim has since ballooned to as much at £1.6 billion plus interest.<blockquote>Gutmann's lawyers had argued Apple concealed issues with batteries in certain phone models and "surreptitiously" installed a power management tool which limited performance.<br/>
<br/>
Apple, however, said the lawsuit is "baseless" and that it strongly denies batteries in iPhones were defective, apart from in a small number of iPhone 6s models for which it offered free battery replacements.</blockquote>Gutmann's claim covers &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 6 through &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; X models, and while the Competition Appeal Tribunal ruled the claim can move forward, it also highlighted "a lack of clarity and specificity" that will need to be resolved before it can actually proceed to trial.<br/>
<br/>
Apple deployed power management features with iOS 10.2.1 in 2017 that <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2017/12/18/geekbench-iphone-6s-slowdowns/">throttled performance</a> to prevent devices with degraded batteries from attempting to draw peak power the batteries could no longer provide. Apple says it introduced the features to help extend device lifespan while minimizing disruptive device shutdowns, but the company was criticized by some customers for not disclosing what it was doing amid suggestions it was attempting to hide defective devices.<br/>
<br/>
Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2017/12/28/apple-iphone-battery-performance-price-drop/">apologized</a> for not better explaining the changes it made and why it did so, and introduced a low-cost battery replacement program that lasted for several years.<br/>
<br/>
In 2020, Apple agreed to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2020/03/02/apple-agrees-to-up-to-500m-batterygate-settlement/">pay up to &#36;500 million</a> to settle a long-running class action lawsuit in the United States over the issue, and the company has faced similar lawsuits in a number of other countries.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone-slowdown/">iPhone Slowdown</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/01/uk-lawsuit-throttled-iphones-moves-forward/">UK Lawsuit Over &#039;Throttled&#039; iPhones Moves Forward</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/uk-lawsuit-over-throttled-iphones-moves-forward.2409517/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>
