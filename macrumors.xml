		<description><![CDATA[Disney <a href="https://thewaltdisneycompany.com/disneys-fiscal-full-year-and-q4-2023-earnings-results-webcast/">today said</a> that it will soon combine Disney+ and Hulu into one streaming service, with a unified app to be available in a beta capacity next month.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/disney.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-909605" /><br/>
Disney CEO Bob Iger <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/11/disney-plus-hulu-combo-app/">first announced plans</a> to merge Hulu and Disney+ into a single app earlier this year. The app will first be offered to those who subscribe to the Disney+ and Hulu bundle, providing those customers with one app to access all their content. Right now, Disney offers a combined bundle that features Disney+ and Hulu, but subscribers need to download two separate apps. Pricing for the app has not been announced, but the current ad-supported Hulu and Disney+ bundle costs &#36;9.99 per month, while the version without ads costs &#36;19.99 per month.<br/>
<br/>
During today's fourth quarter earnings call, Iger confirmed that Disney is on track to roll out the unified app in the United States starting in December, with an official launch to follow in spring 2024.<br/>
<br/>
Disney earlier this month said that it will pay Comcast over &#36;8 billion to purchase Comcast's Hulu shares, which would see Disney being the sole owner of Hulu and will allow for the combined app.<br/>
<br/>
Disney in October increased the price of both Disney+ and Hulu in an effort to bring in more revenue. Ad-free Disney+ is now priced at &#36;13.99 per month, while ad-free Hulu costs &#36;17.99 per month.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/disney/">Disney</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/hulu/">Hulu</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/disney-plus/">Disney Plus</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/08/disney-plus-hulu-combo-app-2/">Disney+ and Hulu Merging Into Single App, Beta Coming in December</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/disney-and-hulu-merging-into-single-app-beta-coming-in-december.2410365/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[LG and Samsung plan to begin mass production of OLED display panels for the next-generation iPad Pro models around February 2024, according to a report today from <a href="https://biz.chosun.com/it-science/ict/2023/11/08/ARI7VWL4TZDMZKCRI2NZ2AKS3Y/">South Korea's <em>Chosun Ilbo</em></a>. The news was highlighted by the <a href="https://www.oled-info.com/chosun-lgd-and-sdc-will-produce-10-million-amoled-displays-apples-ipads-next">website <em>OLED-Info</em></a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/07/iPad-Pro-OLED-Feature-2.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-853666" /><br/>
<em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman expects new 11-inch and 13-inch iPad Pro models with <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/03/gurman-new-ipad-magic-keyboard-to-feature-aluminum/">OLED displays, an M3 chip, and an aluminum Magic Keyboard</a> to launch next year. With mass production of the OLED displays reportedly not beginning until February, it seems unlikely that the next iPad Pro models would be ready to launch in March, a common month for Apple to announce new products. It seems more likely that the next iPad Pro models would be announced at WWDC in June or later, but Apple's plans could still change.<br/>
<br/>
The current iPad Pro models are equipped with LCD panels, and the 12.9-inch model also features mini-LED backlighting for increased brightness and a higher contrast ratio. OLED technology would eliminate the need for backlighting, with benefits including even higher contrast ratio with deeper blacks, lower power consumption, and more. Apple is expected to use <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/17/ipad-pro-2024-oled-hybrid-tech/">very thin hybrid OLED displays</a> with a combination of flexible and rigid materials, which could allow for the next iPad Pro models to be slightly thinner.<br/>
<br/>
There have been rumors about the iPad Pro adopting OLED technology for several years, and it seems that it will finally happen next year. The next iPad Air, iPad mini, and entry-level iPad are all expected to stick with LCD panels.<br/>
<br/>
Apple last updated the iPad Pro line in October 2022, with key new features at the time including the M2 chip, Wi-Fi 6E and Bluetooth 5.3 support, hover functionality for the second-generation Apple Pencil, and support for ProRes video recording.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/oled-ipad-pro/">OLED iPad Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#11-iPad-Pro">11" iPad Pro (Caution)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#12-9-iPad-Pro">12.9" iPad Pro (Caution)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipad.137">iPad</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/08/ipad-pro-oled-display-production-february-report/">iPad Pro OLED Display Production Reportedly to Begin Around February</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ipad-pro-oled-display-production-reportedly-to-begin-around-february.2410359/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Popular accessory maker Nomad today announced the launch of three new products that are designed for use in vehicles. The Mount, Charge Mount, and 70W Car Charger offer charging and mounting solutions for the car.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/nomad-car-mount-charger.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-921798" /><br/>
<a href="https://nomadgoods.com/products/mount-black">Priced at &#36;45</a>, the Mount is a simple MagSafe-compatible accessory that is designed to attach to horizontal and vertical vehicle vents. It features a slim design with a polycarbonate and glass body. As this is just a mount, it does not offer in-car charging.<br/>
<br/>
The <a href="https://nomadgoods.com/products/charge-mount-black">&#36;80 Charge Mount</a> has the same design as the Mount, but it comes with a USB-C cable and an 18W USB-C Car Charger. It is able to charge an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> at up to 7.5W and it works with any of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe-battery-pack/">MagSafe</a> iPhones.<br/>
<br/>
Nomad's &#36;60 <a href="https://nomadgoods.com/products/car-charger-70w-usb-c">70W Car Charger</a> plugs into the 12V socket in the car and offers two USB-C ports for charging iPhones and even Macs. The full 70W is available to a single device if only one USB-C port is in use, otherwise the power is split between the two devices (50W to the blue port and 20W to the other port). The Car Charger features GaN technology for a slim build, but it does not come with USB-C cables so you will need to supply your own.<br/>
<br/>

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-913940" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/resident-evil-4.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="720" /><br/>
Resident Evil 4 is one of the console games that can be played on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a> models with A17 Pro chip. The A17 Pro chip features hardware-accelerated ray tracing and improved GPU capabilities that make console-quality gaming possible.<br/>
<br/>
The title will be playable on the &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj;, the &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; Max, iPads that are equipped with an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m1/">M1</a> or later, and all Apple silicon Macs. <br/>
<br/>
Capcom plans to charge &#36;59.99 for Resident Evil 4 on the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPad&zwnj;, which is the same price as the game on consoles like the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X.

<br/>
Capcom released the Resident Evil 4 remake on PlayStation, Xbox, and PC in March. Compared to the original 2005 title, the updated version includes overhauled graphics, new characters, and updated gameplay elements like crafting items and ammo from resources.<br/>
<br/>
Pre-orders for Resident Evil 4 are <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/resident-evil-4/id6462360082?platform=iphone">available on the App Store</a>, and Capcom says that there will be a demo available for those who want to try the game out before buying.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/08/resident-evil-4-apple-december-20/">Resident Evil 4 Coming to iPhone, iPad and Mac on December 20</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/resident-evil-4-coming-to-iphone-ipad-and-mac-on-december-20.2410323/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[As the end of 2023 approaches, now is a good opportunity to look back at some of the devices and accessories that Apple discontinued throughout the year.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/5-Products-Apple-Discontinued-in-2023-Feature-1.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-921716" /><br/>
Apple products discontinued in 2023 include the iPhone 13 mini, 13-inch MacBook Pro, MagSafe Battery Pack, MagSafe Duo Charger, and leather accessories.<br/>
<br/>
Also check out our lists of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/11/09/apple-discontinued-products-2022/">Apple products discontinued in 2022</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/12/29/5-products-discontinued-by-apple-in-2021/">2021</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>iPhone Mini</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/iPhone-12-Mini.jpeg" alt="" width="1400" height="787" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-921759" /><br/>
Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/12/apple-discontinues-iphone-13-mini/">discontinued the iPhone 13 mini</a> in September after introducing the iPhone 15 series, and this marked the end of the iPhone mini entirely, although a <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/FG8W3LL/A/refurbished-iphone-12-mini-256gb-green-unlocked">refurbished iPhone 12 mini</a> remains available on Apple's online store in the U.S. for now.<br/>
<br/>
Equipped with a 5.4-inch display with slim bezels, the iPhone mini was a favorite among fans of smaller smartphones, but market research firms said the model had <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/04/21/iphone-13-mini-unpopular-march-quarter/">low sales relative to other iPhone models</a>. Apple decided not to release an iPhone 14 mini last year, but it had kept the iPhone 13 mini available as a lower-cost option.<br/>
<br/>
The smallest iPhone that Apple sells brand new is now the iPhone SE with a 4.7-inch display, but it has a very outdated design with a Home button and thicker bezels, and the next iPhone SE is rumored to have a larger 6.1-inch display.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>13-Inch MacBook Pro</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/07/Touch-Bar-13-Inch-MacBook-Pro.jpg" alt="" width="1364" height="769" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-853221" /><br/>
Apple finally <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/30/apple-discontinues-13-inch-macbook-pro/">discontinued the 13-inch MacBook Pro</a> last week following its "Scary Fast" event. The laptop had a seven-year-old design, and it was the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/31/touch-bar-discontinued/">final Mac equipped with a Touch Bar</a> instead of physical function keys.<br/>
<br/>
The 13-inch MacBook Pro was effectively replaced with the new entry-level 14-inch MacBook Pro with the standard M3 chip, although the former started at &#36;1,299 and the latter starts at &#36;1,599. The 14-inch model does offer several upgrades over the 13-inch model, such as the M3 chip, a 120Hz ProMotion display, a 1080p camera, and more ports.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>MagSafe Battery Pack</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/07/magsafe-battery-pack-feature2.jpg" alt="" width="2490" height="1401" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-807787" /><br/>
Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/12/apple-discontinues-magsafe-battery-pack-and-duo/">discontinued the MagSafe Battery Pack</a> in September after introducing the iPhone 15 series. <br/>
<br/>
Released in 2021, the ‌MagSafe Battery Pack‌ was priced at &#36;99 and attaches magnetically to the back of the iPhone 12 and newer, providing hours of additional battery life. While all iPhone 15 models are now equipped with a USB-C port, the battery pack has a Lightning charging port, so it effectively became outdated.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>MagSafe Duo Charger</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/11/magsafe-duo-perspective-feature.jpg" alt="" width="1332" height="750" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-770700" /><br/>
Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/12/apple-discontinues-magsafe-battery-pack-and-duo/">discontinued the MagSafe Duo Charger</a> in September after introducing the iPhone 15 series.<br/>
<br/>
Released in 2020, the MagSafe Duo Charger was a &#36;129 foldable charging mat with both a MagSafe charger for iPhones and an Apple Watch magnetic charging puck. Like the MagSafe Battery Pack, it had a Lightning charging port.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Leather Accessories</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/02/apple-leather-wallet-magsafe.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-784716" /><br/>
Apple stopped selling leather accessories in September, including leather versions of iPhone cases, the MagSafe Wallet, Apple Watch bands, and more, as part of the company's environmental responsibility efforts. Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/12/apple-announces-finewoven/">introduced a new FineWoven fabric material for accessories</a> that it says has a "significantly lower" carbon footprint than leather, but customers have complained about the new iPhone cases <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/25/finewoven-iphone-case-continued-criticism/">being prone to scratches and stains</a>. <br/>
<br/>
<h3>Honorable Mentions</h3><br/>
Apple also <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/31/apple-discontinues-itunes-movie-trailers-app/">discontinued its iTunes Movie Trailers app</a> and the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/01/apple-music-voice-plan-no-longer-available/">Apple Music Voice Plan</a> this year.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/08/apple-discontinued-these-5-products-in-2023/">Apple Discontinued These 5 Products in 2023</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-discontinued-these-5-products-in-2023.2410313/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2023/11/taylor-swift-is-apple-musics-artist-of-the-year-for-2023/">announced</a> that Taylor Swift has been named Apple Music's Artist of the Year for 2023 after reaching "a new realm of superstardom this year."<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/Taylor-Swift-2023-Apple-Music-Artist-of-Year.jpg" alt="" width="1960" height="1102" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-921741" /><br/>
Swift released a new album last month called <em>1989 (Taylor's Version)</em>, and she has been on tour this year. Apple says in the first 10 months of 2023, Swift had 65 songs reach Apple Music's Global Daily Top 100, which was more than any other artist.<br/>
<br/>
"I am so honored to be Apple Music's Artist of the Year," said Swift. "Thank you to every single one of you for making this year the most incredible, joyful, celebratory year ever. From streaming the music nonstop to screaming it together in real life at the shows, dancing chaotically in movie theaters, none of this would have been possible without you. Thank you so much."<br/>
<br/>
"Taylor Swift's impact on music is absolutely undeniable — not just this record-breaking year, but throughout her entire career," said Oliver Schusser, Apple's vice president of Apple Music and Beats. "She is a generation-defining artist and a true change agent in the music industry, and there is no doubt that her impact and influence will be felt for years to come. We are thrilled to have the opportunity to celebrate her achievements."<br/>
<br/>
Swift will receive a physical Apple Music Award featuring Apple's custom 12-inch silicon wafer.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/">Apple Music</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/08/taylor-swift-apple-musics-artist-of-the-year/">Taylor Swift Named Apple Music&#039;s Artist of the Year</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/taylor-swift-named-apple-musics-artist-of-the-year.2410303/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[In 2022, Apple updated the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/">MacBook Air</a> with a complete redesign and the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m2/">M2</a> chip, followed by an all-new 15-inch version this year, so how do the two product lines compare to its latest MacBook Pro models with M3 chips?<br/>
<br/>

Despite now being similar in appearance, the &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; and the MacBook Pro are very different machines, so should you consider purchasing the 13- or 15-inch &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj;, which start at &#36;1,099, to save money, or do you need one of the higher-end 14- or 16-inch MacBook Pro models, which cost at least &#36;500 more? Our guide helps to answer the question of how to decide which of these two popular Apple silicon machines is best for you.<br/>

Both the &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; and MacBook Pro share the same basic design with a flat top and rounded edges on the bottom, but they do have several minor details that differ. For example, while both MacBooks have displays with a "notch" at the top to facilitate the built-in webcam, the MacBook Pro's bezels are noticeably slimmer. The keyboard area of the high-end MacBook Pro is also all-black.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2013/09/macbook-air-design.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="912" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-850089" /><br/>
The &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; and M3 version of the MacBook Pro are available in Silver and Space Gray, but the &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; is also offered in Starlight and Midnight color options, so if you are looking for a particular aesthetic with one of these finishes, you will need to get the &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj;. Space Black is exclusive to the MacBook Pro with the M3 Pro and M3 Max chips.<br/>

<br/>
Dimensions are also a key area of difference between the &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; and MacBook Pro. The 16-inch MacBook Pro is considerably larger and heavier than the 15-inch &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj;, but it is important to not understate the difference between the 14-inch MacBook Pro and the 13-inch &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj;. While the 14-inch MacBook Pro offers a larger display than the &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj;, its marginally larger footprint, added thickness, and an additional 0.8 pounds of weight do make for a noticeably less portable machine if you prefer to travel light.<br/>
<br/>
Even so, the 14-inch MacBook Pro offers a very good balance of portability and performance, so if you need its added capabilities, its size and weight should not hold you back. The 15-inch &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; also provides a good balance of portability and display area, but users wary of its size should opt for the 13-inch model.<br/>
<br/>
<h3 id="ports_and_connectivity">Ports and Connectivity</h3><br/>
The selection of ports is an area of major difference between the two machines. The &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; features just two Thunderbolt ports, while the M3 version of the MacBook Pro adds an HDMI 2.1 port and SDXC card slot. When configured with the M3 Pro or M3 Max, the MacBook Pro has a total of three Thunderbolt 4 ports, in addition to its HDMI 2.1 port and SDXC card slot. Both machines feature a 3.5mm headphone jack with support for high-impedance headphones.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/10/2021-macbook-pro-ports.jpg" alt="" width="1952" height="1156" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-821474" /><br/>
All in all, the MacBook Pro is much more versatile in terms of connectivity, even possessing newer Bluetooth and Wi-Fi specifications, offering useful features for professionals who use SDXC cards from digital cameras or even simply more USB peripherals.<br/>
<br/>
<h3 id="display_size">Display Size</h3><br/>
The smaller &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj;'s display is 13.6 inches in size, which is a little smaller than the 14.2-inch MacBook Pro, and markedly smaller than the 16.2-inch MacBook Pro. 13.6 inches is still bigger than the largest <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a> model, which comes in at 12.9 inches, and even all of the previous &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; and smaller MacBook Pro models, meaning that it should be adequate for most users. The 14.2-inch MacBook Pro simply offers a little bit more screen real estate to those who need high-end capabilities.<br/>
<br/>
The 15.3-inch &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; and 16.2-inch MacBook Pro's displays will be better replacements for a desktop machine and provide much more screen space to arrange multiple windows and use professional applications that benefit from additional display area.<br/>
<br/>
<h3 id="display_technology">Display Technology</h3><br/>
The display technologies of both machines are significantly different. Like most MacBooks in recent years, the &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; has an LCD panel, but owing to its slim bezels and rounded corners, Apple calls it a Liquid Retina display. The 14- and 16-inch MacBook Pro models feature Apple's more advanced mini-LED Liquid Retina XDR technology for deeper blacks, better dynamic range, and improved color accuracy.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/10/macbook-pro-display.jpg" alt="" width="1960" height="1274" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-821240" /><br/>
The XDR display can get much brighter, reaching as high as 1,600 nits of brightness at its peak when showing HDR content. The 14- and 16-inch MacBook Pro models also have ProMotion displays, allowing them to vary their refresh rate up to 120Hz. The &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; does not have a display with a variable refresh rate.<br/>
<br/>
It will be worth getting the high-end MacBook Pro models for viewing and editing HDR content, as well as watching high-framerate video such as sports. The display of the &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; is sufficient for most users and some may not even notice a drastic difference. The MacBook Pro's deeper blacks and smoother on-screen motion simply offer a slightly better experience.<br/>
<br/>
<h3 id="chips">Chips</h3><br/>
The &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; contains the &zwnj;M2&zwnj; chip, while MacBook Pro customers can choose between the M3, M3 Pro, and M3 Max chips. The M3 Pro and M3 Max are scaled-up versions of the M3 chip that offer additional CPU and GPU cores. See the &zwnj;M2&zwnj;, M3, M3 Pro, and M3 Max's Geekbench 5 Benchmark scores below:<br/>
<br/>
<table class="comparison"><br/>

 <td>124,060–157,120</td><br/>
 </tr><br/>
</table><br/>
<div class="clear"></div><br/>
<br/>
The M3 Pro and M3 Max provide CPUs with up to eight additional cores and GPUs with up to 30 additional cores. The &zwnj;M2&zwnj; chip in the &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; is only slightly less powerful than the M3, M3 Pro, and M3 Max in single-core tasks, but the M3 chips, and particularly the Pro and Max versions, are considerably better in multi-core and graphics tasks.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/07/Apple-M3-chip-series-architecture.jpg" alt="" width="2400" height="1350" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-920045" /><br/>
With significantly more transistors, performance CPU cores, and GPU cores, the M3 Pro and M3 Max are powerful chips designed for professionals with demanding workflows. The &zwnj;M2&zwnj; and M3, on the other hand, are more consumer-oriented chips focused on delivering surprisingly impressive performance and excellent efficiency to keep temperatures down and prolong battery life.<br/>
<br/>
It is also worth noting that the &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; is passively cooled and contains no fan, which can slightly constrain peak performance compared to the MacBook Pro, since the high-end machines have large fans to actively cool the system and push the chips harder.<br/>
<br/>
The limitations of the &zwnj;M2&zwnj; and M3 also mean that &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; and MacBook Pro devices configured with these chips support only one external display, whereas M3 Pro and M3 Max machines support up to two and four external displays, respectively.<br/>
<br/>
<h3 id="memory_and_storage">Memory and Storage</h3><br/>
The &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; can be configured with up to 24GB of unified memory and up to 2TB of storage, which should be more than enough for the vast majority of users. For those who need even more memory and storage, the MacBook Pro can be configured with significantly more memory and storage than the top-spec &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
The M3 Pro and M3 Max chips in the MacBook Pro also provide up to 150GB/s and 400GB/s memory bandwidth respectively – an enormous increase over the 100GB/s memory bandwidth with the &zwnj;M2&zwnj; chip in the &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
Buyers should also be aware that the 256GB &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; base models have up to 50 percent slower SSDs than configurations with more storage. This is because the base models only have a single SSD module inside, whereas models with larger amounts of storage have two SSD chips, significantly increasing the overall speed of the machine's storage.<br/>
<br/>
<h3 id="speakers_and_microphones">Speakers and Microphones</h3><br/>
The &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; has a four-speaker sound system that is surprisingly full and balanced for such a small, slim device. The MacBook Pro takes things to the next level with a high-fidelity six-speaker sound system with force-cancelling woofers for dramatically bigger and deeper audio – something that may be invaluable to users who work in professional audio production or simply listen to a lot of music out-loud.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2013/09/macbook-pro-speakers.jpg" alt="" width="1128" height="684" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-821784" /><br/>
The &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; has a three-mic array with directional beamforming that is perfect for activities like video calls and voice notes. The MacBook Pro has what Apple calls a "studio-quality" three-mic array with high signal-to-noise ratio and directional beamforming. While they are not as good as a dedicated microphone, the MacBook Pro's microphones are impressive and, at a push, are suitable for production purposes like podcasting.<br/>
<br/>
<h3 id="battery_life">Battery Life</h3><br/>
The &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; has an 18-hour battery life, offering the same battery life as the 14-inch MacBook Pro with the M3 Pro or M3 Max chips, and four hours less than the 14-inch MacBook Pro with the M3 chip and the 16-inch MacBook Pro. <br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="other_macbook_options">Other MacBook Options</h2><br/>
If you are looking for a more affordable Apple silicon MacBook, there is the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m1/">M1</a> &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj;, which sports a 13.3-inch Retina display, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/touch-id/">Touch ID</a>, two Thunderbolt ports, and more, for prices starting at &#36;999. For users on a strict budget, the &zwnj;M1&zwnj; &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; is still a good option.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="final_thoughts">Final Thoughts</h2><br/>
Overall, the &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; is the best option for casual users, offering an excellent balance of features and performance in a highly portable design. The &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj;'s &#36;1,099 starting price is much more affordable compared to the MacBook Pro, and with an education discount or an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/best-apple-deals/#macbook_air">offer from our Apple Deals Roundup</a>, it is possible to get that price down by at least &#36;100. The additional &#36;500 to get the MacBook Pro likely is not worth it for most ordinary users, and on the contrary, many will prefer the slimmer, lighter design of the &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; and perhaps even its additional color options.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2013/09/macbook-pro-sizes-space-gray.jpg" alt="" width="1500" height="693" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-821783" /><br/>
Professionals who require larger and more accurate displays, additional ports, more memory and storage, and a very high level of performance should look to the 14- and 16-inch MacBook Pro with the M3 Pro and M3 Max chips, and the higher price points of these machines reflects this. The high-end MacBook Pro models are not targeted at everyday consumers, being clearly tailored to creatives and professionals who rely heavily on the capabilities of their machines. As such, these high-end models should only be a go-to option if you are a power-user or professional who can make use of its advanced features. The 16-inch MacBook Pro, in particular, is also potentially a good desktop replacement machine due to its large display.<br/>

</ul><br/>
<br/>
Alternatively, if you are already considering the &#36;1,299 15-inch &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj;, it may be worth paying more to get the M3 MacBook Pro. For just &#36;200 more, the M3 MacBook Pro offers a considerably better Liquid Retina XDR display with ProMotion, a more powerful chip with active cooling, four extra hours of battery life, better speakers and microphones, an HDMI port and SDXC card slot, and more. In fact, if you configure the 15-inch &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; with 512GB of storage to match the M3 MacBook Pro, there is only a &#36;100 between the two machines, so in this instance it is almost always worth getting the more powerful machine, unless maximizing screen size is your only priority.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/">MacBook Air</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro/">MacBook Pro 14 & 16" </a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#15-MacBook-Air">15" MacBook Air (Neutral)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Pro_16">14" & 16" MacBook Pro (Buy Now)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Air">13" MacBook Air (Don't Buy)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macbook-air.122">MacBook Air</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macbook-pro.90">MacBook Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/macbook-air-vs-macbook-pro-buyers-guide/">MacBook Air vs. MacBook Pro Buyer&#039;s Guide</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/macbook-air-vs-macbook-pro-buyers-guide.2378980/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

OWC has an ultra-rare discount on Apple's HomePod mini, priced at <a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-462641-11911660?url=https%3A%2F%2Feshop.macsales.com%2Fitem%2FApple%2F4Y5G2LLA%2F"><strong>&#36;78.99</strong></a>, down from &#36;99.00. OWC says that these are brand new HomePod mini speakers, but they are not shipped in their original retail packaging and instead come bulk packaged with a 90 day OWC fulfilled limited warranty.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/homepod-mini-bells.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-921661" /><div class="center-wrap"><em><strong>Note: These are in new condition but come in bulk packaging.</strong></em></div><br/>

<br/>
HomePod mini discounts this steep are so rare, the last time we tracked anything remotely in the ballpark of &#36;20 off was Black Friday 2022. OWC has every color on sale at this record low price, so if you've been waiting for a sale now is the time.<br/>
<br/>
If you want the upgraded second generation HomePod model, B&H Photo still has the best deal around.

Although this isn't a particularly big markdown on the 2023 speaker, it remains the best deal we've tracked to date.<br/>

		<title>WhatsApp Now Lets You Hide Your IP Address During Calls</title>

		<description><![CDATA[WhatsApp has <a href="https://engineering.fb.com/2023/11/08/security/whatsapp-calls-enhancing-security/">introduced</a> a new privacy feature that lets you hide your IP address from whoever you call over the encrypted communications platform. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/03/Whatsapp-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2250" height="1266" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-786421" /><br/>
As it stands, one-to-one calls over WhatsApp are established as a direct peer-to-peer connection between users. While this ensures the best possible voice quality, it means the connected devices must reveal their IP addresses to each other. <br/>
<br/>
According to WhatsApp, the new privacy setting introduced today works differently by relaying all of your calls through WhatsApp's servers to obfuscate your location, rather than connecting you directly to the person you are calling. Meta engineers elaborated on the feature in a <a href="https://engineering.fb.com/2023/11/08/security/whatsapp-calls-enhancing-security/">blog post</a>:<br/>
<blockquote>Most calling products people use today have peer-to-peer connections between participants. This direct connection allows for faster data transfers and better call quality, but it also means that participants need to know each other’s IP addresses so that call data packets can be delivered to the correct device – meaning that the IP addresses are visible to both callers on a 1:1 call. IP addresses may contain information that some of our most privacy-conscious users are mindful of, such as broad geographical location or internet provider.<br/>
<br/>
To address this concern, we introduced a new feature on WhatsApp that allows you to protect your IP address during calls. With this feature enabled, all your calls will be relayed through WhatsApp’s servers, ensuring that other parties in the call cannot see your IP address and subsequently deduce your general geographical location. </blockquote><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/WhatsApp-Calls_image.jpg" alt="" width="863" height="550" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-921648" /><br/>
<br/>
At the same time, all relayed calls through WhatsApp's servers remain end-to-end encrypted, so no-one – not even WhatsApp – can listen to them.<br/>
<br/>
Before you consider using the new call relay privacy setting, WhatsApp says to bear in mind that call quality might be reduced as a result. To enable the setting, make sure you have updated to the latest version of WhatsApp, then follow these steps.<br/>
<ol><li>In WhatsApp, tap <strong>Settings ➝ Privacy</strong>.</li><br/>
<li>Tap <strong>Advanced</strong>.</li><br/>
<li>Toggle on the switch next to <strong>Protect IP address in calls</strong>.</li></ol><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/whatsapp-privacy-ip-address.jpg" alt="whatsapp" width="4137" height="2716" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-921670" /><br/>
<br/>
Note that group calls are always relayed through WhatsApp's servers by default. <br/>
<br/>
In June, WhatsApp added a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/silence-unknown-callers-whatsapp/">Silence Unknown Callers feature</a> for the encrypted messaging platform. Like the similar option in iOS, the feature is designed to automatically screen out spam, scams, and calls from unknown people for increased protection.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/whatsapp/">WhatsApp</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/privacy/">Privacy</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/08/whatsapp-hide-your-ip-address-during-calls/">WhatsApp Now Lets You Hide Your IP Address During Calls</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/whatsapp-now-lets-you-hide-your-ip-address-during-calls.2410293/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/07/apple-releases-macos-sonoma-14-1-1/">released macOS Sonoma 14.1.1</a> on Tuesday with "important bug fixes." While the release notes did not specify which bugs were fixed, we have confirmed that the update resolves a software update issue with M3 Macs and an Adobe Photoshop bug.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/No-13-Inch-M3-MacBook-Pro-Feature-2.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-921296" /><br/>
At least some 14-inch MacBook Pro and iMac models equipped with the standard M3 chip shipped with an unreleased build of macOS Ventura 13.5 installed, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/07/14-inch-macbook-pro-m3-macos-sonoma-update-issue/">macOS 14.1 was not showing up as an available software update</a> in the System Settings app. Fortunately, it is now possible to update these Macs to macOS 14.1.1. MacBook Pro models with the M3 Pro and M3 Max chips were not affected by this issue.<br/>
<br/>
macOS 14.1.1 also <a href="https://community.adobe.com/t5/photoshop-ecosystem-bugs/p-macos-14-1-photoshop-2024-v25-0-25-1-toolbar-click-through-issue/idc-p/14218733#M95503">fixes a bug</a> that prevented users from clicking on a section of the toolbar in Photoshop on macOS 14.1, as <a href="https://twitter.com/JonyIveParody/status/1722236152718283246">noted by @JonyIveParody on X</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Apple also released macOS Ventura 13.6.2 with bug fixes. The update resolves an issue where 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models with Apple silicon chips "start up to a black screen or circled exclamation point after the built-in display's default refresh rate is changed," according to an <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT213327">Apple support document</a>.<br/>
<br/>
macOS 14.1.1 and macOS 13.6.2 <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201222">do not have any published security patches</a>, despite Apple's release notes saying each update includes security fixes.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sonoma/">macOS Sonoma</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macos-ventura.239">macOS Ventura</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macos-sonoma.243">macOS Sonoma</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/08/macos-14-1-1-bug-fixes/">macOS 14.1.1 Fixes M3 Mac Upgrade Issue and Photoshop Bug</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/macos-14-1-1-fixes-m3-mac-upgrade-issue-and-photoshop-bug.2410289/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2023/11/apples-swift-student-challenge-to-open-in-2024-with-new-category/">announced</a> that it plans to hold its next Swift Student Challenge in February 2024, marking the first time the company has provided advanced notice to give students time to prepare. The Swift Student Challenge tasks students with creating an innovative coding project using the Swift Playgrounds app.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/swift-student-challenge-2024.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-921665" /><br/>
This year's Swift Student Challenge will have 350 winners, and there will be a category that recognizes a total of 50 Distinguished Winners for standout submissions. All of the Distinguished Winners will be invited to Apple's headquarters in Cupertino, California, where they will be able to connect with their peers and the Apple team, while all winners will be granted a free one-year membership in the Apple Developer program.<blockquote>"At Apple, we believe that everyone can learn to code and build apps, and we're proud to support and recognize aspiring student developers with the Swift Student Challenge each year," said Susan Prescott, Apple's vice president of Worldwide Developer Relations and Education & Enterprise Marketing. "We know that students are eager to learn coding skills to solve challenges they care about -- whether it's building an app to help peers identify mental health resources or supporting sustainability efforts on campus -- and want to know how to get started. Apple is releasing new coding resources for students and educators, working with our community partners on dedicated Swift programming, and sharing advance notice of the Swift Student Challenge timeline for 2024. We can't wait to see the app playgrounds students submit next year."</blockquote><br/>
Apple has been holding an annual Swift Student Challenge for several years now, but it is typically announced when the dates for WWDC are announced, and past winners have been invited to attend the Worldwide Developers Conference. Apple says that this year's 50 Distinguished Winners will be invited to Cupertino "next summer."<br/>
<br/>
Starting in February 2024, students will have three weeks to submit their app playgrounds to Apple. Apple judges entries on technical accomplishment, creativity of ideas, and content of written responses explaining the project. Students can sign up on the Apple Developer website to be <a href="https://developer.apple.com/swift-student-challenge/">notified when submissions open</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Along with the Swift Student Challenge, Apple is launching for new Everyone Can Code projects that students can use to learn to create apps and refine their app development skills. The new projects task students with designing a simple app, building with stacks and shapes, building custom shapes, and designing an app icon.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/swift/">Swift</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-developer-program/">Apple Developer Program</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/08/swift-student-challenge-february-2024/">Apple to Launch Next Swift Student Challenge in February 2024</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-to-launch-next-swift-student-challenge-in-february-2024.2410286/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<title>Google, European Telecoms Giants Call on EU to Force Open iMessage</title>

		<description><![CDATA[Google and European telecom groups have urged EU regulators to designate iMessage a "core" service that would force Apple to make the communications platform interoperable with competing chat services, reports the <em><a href="https://www.ft.com/content/ec2ec699-a91c-4389-b1a9-ae06dca836d5">Financial Times</a></em>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2016/01/European-Commisssion.jpg" alt="" width="1080" height="719" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-484620" /><br/>
In a letter sent to the European Commission, the EU's executive body, the signatories including Google and some of Europe's largest telecoms operators claimed that Apple's service meets the qualitative thresholds of the act, and should therefore be captured by the rules to "benefit European consumers and businesses."<br/>
<br/>
The "fundamental nature" of iMessage as "an important gateway between business users and their customers is without doubt justification for Apple’s designation as gatekeeper for its iMessage service," argued Google, Vodafone, Deutsche Telekom, Telefónica and Orange in the letter. They said consumers would be better off as a result of the designation because "enriched messaging" is only available between Apple users, according to the report.<br/>
<br/>
Apple declined to comment on the report, but pointed to an earlier statement that said: <blockquote>"iMessage is a great service that Apple users love because it provides an easy way to communicate with friends and family while offering industry-leading privacy and security protections.<br/>
<br/>
"Consumers today have access to a wide variety of messaging apps, and often use many at once, which reflects how easy it is to switch between them. iMessage is designed and marketed for personal consumer communications, and we look forward to explaining to the commission why iMessage is outside the scope of the DMA."</blockquote>Apple in September <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/05/imessage-isnt-popular-enough-for-regulation/">contested</a> the EU regulator labeling them as "gatekeepers" ahead of the publication of the first list of services to be regulated by the Digital Markets Act (DMA). The legislation introduces new rules that apply to services considered to be core platform services and forces them to open up their various services and platforms to other companies and developers. For example, Apple could be forced to allow third-party companies and rival apps like Meta's WhatsApp to integrate directly with iMessage.<br/>
<br/>
However, Apple argued that iMessage does not meet the number of users required for the DMA's rules to apply, and should not be obliged to comply with it. "iMessage does not constitute an important gateway in the union for business users to reach end users due to its small scale relative to other messaging services," Apple reportedly told the commission.<br/>
<br/>
Analysts estimate that iMessage has as many as one billion users around the world, but Apple has not disclosed any official numbers about the service for several years. Whether iMessage will be included on the EU's initial list of gatekeeper services will depend on how it defines the market in which it operates.<br/>
<br/>
The EU's investigation into iMessage is ongoing, and the European Commission has until February to come to a decision. <div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/imessage/">iMessage</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/european-union/">European Union</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/european-commission/">European Commission</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/08/google-asks-eu-to-force-open-imessage/">Google, European Telecoms Giants Call on EU to Force Open iMessage</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/google-european-telecoms-giants-call-on-eu-to-force-open-imessage.2410274/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<title>8GB RAM on M3 MacBook Pro &#039;Analogous to 16GB&#039; on PCs, Claims Apple</title>

		<description><![CDATA[Following the unveiling of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/30/apple-announces-m3-macbook-pros/">new MacBook Pro models last week</a>, Apple surprised some with the introduction of a base 14-inch MacBook Pro with M3 chip, which replaced the discontinued M2 13-inch MacBook Pro in Apple's Mac lineup. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/8gb-ram-mbp-bob-borchers.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="720" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-921580" /><br/>
Starting at &#36;1,599, the 14-inch M3 MacBook Pro comes with 8GB of unified memory. That makes it &#36;300 more expensive than the &#36;1,299 starting price of the now-discontinued ‌M2‌ 13-inch MacBook Pro with 8GB. Users can opt for 16GB or 24GB at checkout, but these configuration options cost an extra &#36;200 and &#36;400 at purchase, respectively, and cannot be upgraded at a later date because of Apple's unified memory architecture.<br/>
<br/>
This has left Apple open to criticism from users who argue that 8GB is not a sufficient amount of RAM for most creative professional workflows, and that 16GB should be the bare minimum for a machine that is marketed as "Pro," rather than an additional several hundred dollar outlay. <br/>
<br/>
In a recent interview with <a href="https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV16M411Q7BG/">Chinese ML engineer and content creator Lin YilYi</a>, Apple's VP of worldwide product marketing Bob Borchers has directly responded to this criticism. After YilYi characterized the base M3 MacBook Pro coming with 8GB of RAM as the "one major concern" of prospective buyers, Borchers replied:<br/>
<blockquote>Comparing our memory to other system's memory actually isn't equivalent, because of the fact that we have such an efficient use of memory, and we use memory compression, and we have a unified memory architecture. <br/>
<br/>
<strong>Actually, 8GB on an M3 MacBook Pro is probably analogous to 16GB on other systems. We just happen to be able to use it much more efficiently.</strong> And so what I would say is I would have people come in and try what they want to do on their systems, and they will I think see incredible performance. If you look at the raw data and capabilities of these systems, it really is phenomenal. And this is the place where I think people need to see beyond the specs, and actually go and look beyond the capabilities, and listen to trusted people like you who have actually used the systems.<br/>
<br/>
People need to look beyond the specifications and actually go and understand how that technology is being used. That's the true test. </blockquote>While the 14-inch MacBook Pro with 8GB of unified memory is &#36;300 more expensive than the M2 13-inch MacBook Pro it replaces, there are a number of other benefits worth considering aside from the faster processor, such as the larger, brighter mini-LED Liquid Retina XDR display, support for 120Hz ProMotion refresh rates, and better battery life. Other improvements include additional ports, a better 1080p FaceTime HD camera, a six-speaker sound system, Wi-Fi 6E support, and Bluetooth 5.3.<br/>
<br/>
What do you think about the 8GB of unified memory supplied in the base configuration of M3 MacBook Pro? Does it suit your requirements, or make the "Pro" machine grossly underpowered for your use case?

		<description><![CDATA[The United States Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) <a href="https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/newsroom/cfpb-proposes-new-federal-oversight-of-big-tech-companies-and-other-providers-of-digital-wallets-and-payment-apps/">today proposed</a> new oversight requirements for technology companies like Apple that offer digital wallets and payment apps.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/apple-pay-feature-dynamic-island.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-921515" /><br/>
According to the CFPB, payment services like <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-pay/">Apple Pay</a> are growing in popularity, but the companies behind them are not subject to the same "supervisory examinations" that banks undergo.<br/>
<br/>
The newly proposed rule would require companies that handle more than five million transactions per year to adhere to the same rules as large banks, credit unions, and other financial institutions that are supervised by the CFPB.<br/>
<br/>
The CFPB claims that there have been an increasing number of complaints about tech companies in the consumer finance market, and it argues that examiners should be able to carefully scrutinize the activities of tech companies to ensure they are following the law.<br/>
<blockquote>Big Tech and other companies operating in consumer finance markets blur the traditional lines that have separated banking and payments from commercial activities. The CFPB has found that this blurring can put consumers at risk, especially when the same traditional banking safeguards, like deposit insurance, may not apply.<br/>
<br/>
Despite their impact on consumer finance, Big Tech and other nonbank companies operating in the payments sphere do not receive the same regulatory scrutiny and oversight as banks and credit unions. While the CFPB has enforcement authority over these companies, the CFPB has not previously had, inside many of these firms, examiners carefully scrutinizing their activities to ensure they are following the law and monitoring their executives.</blockquote><br/>
The CFPB wants to be able to conduct examinations of tech companies to make sure that they are following funds transfer, privacy, and consumer protection laws, and adhering to the same rules that banks must follow. If finalized, the proposed rule would give the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau more oversight into the financial services provided by companies like Apple and Google.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/07/apple-pay-oversight-cfpb/">U.S. Regulators Want More Control Oversight Into Apple Pay</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/u-s-regulators-want-more-control-oversight-into-apple-pay.2410236/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

Apple in September began offering a range of "Meet with the Apple Experts" resources for developers, and the labs that are available this month are a continuation of that effort.<br/>
<br/>
There are a range of &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; activities where developers can learn about app discovery, engagement, custom product pages, subscription best practices, and more, plus opportunities for developers to try the Vision Pro at test labs in Cupertino, London, Munich, New York City, Shanghai, Singapore, Sydney, or Tokyo.<br/>
<br/>
Apple is also offering activities focused on the Vision Pro, with the aim of helping developers learn to design and build apps and games for the headset. Developers can opt in to one-on-one consultations as well, getting advice on app design, new technologies, and other topics.<br/>
<br/>
The sessions are held in multiple time zones around the world, with some of them online and some in person.

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's latest 16-inch M3 MacBook Pro models are able to fast charge at 140W over USB-C with a 240W USB-C cable, according to a support document <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212755">that was updated today</a>.<br/>

2021 and 2022 16-inch MacBook Pro models with M-series chips are limited to faster 140W charging with the USB-C to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe-battery-pack/">MagSafe</a> 3 cable that Apple provides due to USB-C limitations, with the USB-C ports offering only up to 100W.<br/>
<br/>
The 2023 16-inch MacBook Pro can charge at the full 140W through &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; or through a USB-C port when a 140W+ power adapter is paired with a 240W cable, such as the 240W USB-C cable that Apple <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MU2G3AM/A/240w-usb-c-charge-cable-2-m">began selling in September</a>.<br/>
<br/>
This update is only applicable to 16-inch models as 14-inch models can fast charge with a 96W charger, which USB-C ports were already able to provide for older machines.<br/>
<br/>
The option to fast charge a 16-inch M3 MacBook Pro at 140W over USB-C gives MacBook Pro owners more options when it comes to charging, though it is worth noting that the 240W cables are limited to USB 2.0 data transfer speeds. <div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro/">MacBook Pro 14 & 16" </a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Pro_16">14" & 16" MacBook Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macbook-pro.90">MacBook Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/07/16-inch-m3-macbook-pro-usb-c-fast-charge/">16-Inch M3 MacBook Pro Can Fast Charge Over USB-C With 240W Cable</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/16-inch-m3-macbook-pro-can-fast-charge-over-usb-c-with-240w-cable.2410224/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>
