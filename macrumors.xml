		<description><![CDATA[With the launch of the refreshed <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/">iPad Air</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a> models, Apple introduced a new "<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-pencil/">Apple Pencil</a> Pro." No &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; options have been discontinued, which means there are now four total Apple Pencils to choose from.<br/>
<br/>

While the updated &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; are compatible with the &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; Pro and the USB-C &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj;, they do not work with the &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; 2. Older iPads are also not able to work with the &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj; Pro.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple at its "Let Loose" event today <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/07/apple-event-live-blog-may-2024/">announced</a> new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/">iPad Air</a> models, and there are smaller changes compared to the previous generation devices that did not get mentioned during the event but are worth knowing about. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/12/https-images.macrumors.comarticle-new202112iphone-12-sim-card-slot-yellow.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-831090" /><br/>
One of the differences worth noting is the lack of a physical SIM card slot. On the previous generation models, the cellular versions of both the &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; and the &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; included a physical SIM card slot. In the new devices, that's no longer the case. All cellular models now support eSIM only.<br/>
<br/>
It's a small but crucial detail for anyone looking to upgrade their <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> while sticking with their current cellular plan. Apple has not divulged the reason why it chose to remove the physical SIM slot, but it could have been a design decision related to making the devices slimmer, or a necessity to keep them slim, given all of the devices' hardware upgrades.<br/>
<br/>
Either way, the change brings parity to Apple's latest &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; models and its <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>, which dropped the physical SIM slot in 2022 with the launch of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-14/">iPhone 14</a>.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/">iPad Air </a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/may-2024-apple-event/">May 2024 Apple Event</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPad-Air">iPad Air (Buy Now)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#11-iPad-Pro">11" iPad Pro (Buy Now)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#12-9-iPad-Pro">12.9" iPad Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipad.137">iPad</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/07/2024-ipad-air-ipad-pro-no-sim-slot/">Apple&#039;s New Cellular iPad Air and iPad Pro Models Are eSIM Only</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apples-new-cellular-ipad-air-and-ipad-pro-models-are-esim-only.2425644/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today introduced ultra thin <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a> models, which are the thinnest <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> models to date. In fact, Apple is using the tagline "thinpossible" to describe the new tablets, and with that reduction in thickness, there's also been a reduction in weight.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/ipad-pro-thin-light.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-949512" /><br/>
Both &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; models are lighter than the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/">iPad Air</a> models, despite the &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; models having the "Air" name that has historically been used to denote a light weight and a thin design when compared to Pro devices.<br/>
<ul><br/>
 	<li><strong>13-inch iPad Pro</strong> - 1.28 pounds (579 grams)</li><br/>
 	<li><strong>13-inch iPad Air</strong> - 1.36 pounds (617 grams)</li><br/>
 	<li><strong>11-inch iPad Pro</strong> - 0.98 pounds (444 grams)</li><br/>
 	<li><strong>11-inch iPad Air</strong> - 1.02 pounds (462 grams)</li><br/>
</ul><br/>
The 11-inch &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; is 5.3mm thick, while the 13-inch &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; is 5.1mm thick, which Apple pointed out is thinner than the iPod nano. Both &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; models are 6.1mm thick, comparatively, and they have noticeably thicker bezels.<br/>
<br/>
&zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; pricing starts at &#36;599, while &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; pricing starts at &#36;999.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/may-2024-apple-event/">May 2024 Apple Event</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/07/ipad-pro-ipad-air-weight/">Apple&#039;s New iPad Pro Models Weigh Less Than iPad Air Models</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apples-new-ipad-pro-models-weigh-less-than-ipad-air-models.2425638/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

<br/>

<br/>
The cost breakdown for the top-specification <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a> is as follows:<br/>
<br/>
<ul><br/>
	<li><strong>13-inch iPad Pro</strong> (starting price): &#36;1,299</li><br/>
	<li><strong>2TB storage</strong>: +&#36;1,000</li><br/>

</ul><br/>
<br/>
The maxed-out &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; costs &#36;2,599, but with the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-pencil/">Apple Pencil</a> Pro and the Magic Keyboard for &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj;, it comes to a total of &#36;3,077 – a new high for the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj;.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#11-iPad-Pro">11" iPad Pro (Buy Now)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#12-9-iPad-Pro">12.9" iPad Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipad.137">iPad</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/07/fully-loaded-ipad-pro-costs-over-3000/">New iPad Pro With All Options Costs Over &#36;3,000</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/new-ipad-pro-with-all-options-costs-over-3-000.2425634/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[With the debut of updated <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/">iPad Air</a> models, Apple has streamlined its <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> lineup with a range of devices available in different sizes and price points. The &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; now comes in two sizes like the &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj;, the ninth-generation &#36;329 &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; has been discontinued, and Apple has dropped the price of the standard 10th-generation &zwnj;iPad&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/ipad-lineup-2024.jpg" alt="" width="2703" height="1520" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-949499" /><br/>
Apple's full lineup with starting prices:<br/>
<ul><br/>
 	<li><strong>13-inch iPad Pro</strong> - &#36;1,299</li><br/>
 	<li><strong>11-inch iPad Pro</strong> - &#36;999</li><br/>
 	<li><strong>13-inch iPad Air</strong> - &#36;799</li><br/>
 	<li><strong>11-inch iPad Air</strong> - &#36;599</li><br/>
 	<li><strong>10.9-inch iPad</strong> - &#36;349 (down from &#36;449)</li><br/>
 	<li><strong>8.3-inch iPad mini</strong> - &#36;499</li><br/>
</ul><br/>
The low-cost &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; now starts at &#36;349 instead of &#36;329 because the ninth-generation &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; has been discontinued, but the 10th-generation model has A14 chip instead of the older A13 chip. All of the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; models can be updated with additional storage space, which increases the price. The high-end 2TB 13-inch &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj;, for example, is &#36;2,299, and even more expensive with nano-texture glass and cellular connectivity.<br/>
<br/>
Apple introduced a new Magic Keyboard and an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-pencil/">Apple Pencil</a> Pro to go along with the &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; models. The &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; can be ordered as of today.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/may-2024-apple-event/">May 2024 Apple Event</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/07/apple-full-ipad-lineup/">Here&#039;s Apple&#039;s Full iPad Lineup With New iPad Pro and iPad Air Models</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/heres-apples-full-ipad-lineup-with-new-ipad-pro-and-ipad-air-models.2425633/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today unveiled the M4 chip, its newest system on a chip for the 2024 <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a> lineup. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/f-10157b8614334113470339875ff78668348974ef-1.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="901" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-949491" /><br/>
Apple said that the M4 chip features a new up-to-10-core CPU of up to four performance cores and six efficiency cores. The M4 chip comes in two different models: the 9-core CPU with 3 performance cores and 6 efficiency cores (for 256GB and 512GB &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj;), and 10-core CPU with 4 performance cores and 6 efficiency cores (for 1TB and 2TB &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj;).<br/>
<br/>
The M4 chip is built with second-generation <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/3nm/">3nm</a> technology and features a new display engine. It delivers up to 50% faster CPU performance than the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m2/">M2</a> in the previous ‌&zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj;‌ and four-times faster rendering performance.<br/>
<br/>
For performance in gaming, the M4 chip features Dynamic Caching that helps significantly increases performance for demanding pro apps and games. It also enables hardware-accelerated ray tracing on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> for the first time.<br/>
<br/>
Finally, the M4 includes a Neural Engine that fuels accelerated AI workloads. Apple mentioned that this is the company's most powerful Neural Engine ever, capable of 38 trillion operations per second and helping users accomplish AI tasks quickly on the &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/07/apple-announces-new-ipad-pro/">latest iPad Pro models</a> are available with a matte nano-texture display option for the first time.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/ipad-pro-2024.jpg" alt="" width="3840" height="2160" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-949477" /><br/>
The nano-texture glass is designed for users who work in high-end, color-managed workflows, or challenging lighting conditions. It is etched at the nanometer scale to maintain image quality and contrast while scattering ambient light for reduced glare. <br/>
<br/>
Nano-texture glass has only been available on the Pro Display XDR, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/">iMac</a>, and Studio Display so far, making this the first time that it has come to a touch-based device.<br/>
<br/>
Customers can only configure the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a> with nano-texture glass with 1TB and 2TB models for an additional cost of &#36;100. With an 11-inch model, this brings the price to &#36;1,699 or &#36;2,099, and with a 13-inch model it brings the price to &#36;1,999 or &#36;2,399.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#11-iPad-Pro">11" iPad Pro (Buy Now)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#12-9-iPad-Pro">12.9" iPad Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipad.137">iPad</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/07/ipad-pro-nano-texture-glass/">iPad Pro&#039;s &#36;100 Nano-Texture Glass Option Only Available With 1TB and 2TB Models</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ipad-pros-100-nano-texture-glass-option-only-available-with-1tb-and-2tb-models.2425628/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[To go along with the new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a> models that were introduced today, Apple debuted updated versions of both Final Cut Pro and Logic Pro. The updated Logic Pro 2 software is "smarter than ever," delivering new experiences for songwriting, beat-making, producing, and mixing.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/apple-logic-pro-2.jpeg" alt="" width="1600" height="901" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-949469" /><br/>
Logic Pro has new AI-based studio assistant features that help artists make music. Session Players expand the Drummer capabilities in Logic Pro, with Apple adding a new Bass Player and Keyboard Player, plus a Stem Splitter to extract work with individual parts of a single audio recording.<br/>
<br/>
Stem Splitter is designed to allow artists to separate mixed audio into distinct parts: Drums, Bass, Vocals, and Other instruments. Separating tracks makes it easier to apply effects, add new parts, and change the mix.<blockquote>"Logic Pro gives creatives everything they need to write, produce, and mix a great song, and our latest features take that creativity to a whole new level," said Brent Chiu-Watson, Apple's senior director of Apps Worldwide Product Marketing. "Logic Pro's new AI-backed updates, combined with the unparalleled performance of iPad, Mac, and M-series Apple silicon, provide creative pros with the best music creation experience in the industry."</blockquote>With a new ChromaGlow feature, users can dial in the perfect tone and choose from five different saturation styles to add ultrarealistic warmth, presence, and punch to tracks.<br/>
<br/>
Logic Pro is available for the new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> models and the Mac, and it is set to come out on May 13. The software is free for existing users, and &#36;200 for new users.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/may-2024-apple-event/">May 2024 Apple Event</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/07/apple-logic-pro-2/">Apple Introduces Logic Pro 2 With New AI Features</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-introduces-logic-pro-2-with-new-ai-features.2425621/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today discontinued the ninth-generation iPad, which was the final iPad model that it sold with a Lightning port. In addition, Apple lowered the price of the tenth-generation iPad, which now starts at &#36;349 in the U.S. instead of &#36;449.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/10/10th-Gen-iPad-Feature-Fanned-Blue.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-869880" /><br/>
The ninth-generation iPad started at &#36;329 in the U.S., so the tenth-generation iPad is now much closer to that price point.<br/>
<br/>
Despite the ninth-generation iPad being discontinued, the original Apple Pencil with a Lightning connector remains available for &#36;99.<br/>
<br/>
Apple's entire iPad lineup is now equipped with USB-C ports, excluding refurbished models.<br/>
<br/>
There were no hardware changes to the iPad 10 or the iPad mini announced today, with only the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/07/apple-announces-new-ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/07/apple-announces-ipad-air-models-in-new-11-13-inch/">iPad Air lineups receiving updates</a>.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/may-2024-apple-event/">May 2024 Apple Event</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPad">iPad (Don't Buy)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipad.137">iPad</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/07/ipad-9-discontinued-ipad-10-now-starts-at-349/">iPad 9 Discontinued, iPad 10 Now Starts at &#36;349</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ipad-9-discontinued-ipad-10-now-starts-at-349.2425617/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

<br/>
Two colors are available that match the new &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj;.

A new sensor in the Apple Pencil Pro allows users to squeeze the accessory to bring up a tool palette to quickly switch tools, line weights, and colors. In addition, a new gyroscope allows users to rotate the Apple Pencil Pro for precise control of shaped pen and brush tools.<br/>
<br/>
Equipped with a new haptic engine, the Apple Pencil Pro provides a light tap when users squeeze, use double-tap, or snap to a Smart Shape.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2024/05/apple-unveils-stunning-new-ipad-pro-with-m4-chip-and-apple-pencil-pro/">today unveiled</a> redesigned <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a> models featuring the M4 chip, Ultra Retina XDR OLED displays, a nano-texture display option, and more.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/f-7ba5b5b668dd68b7179a599305cff6b117ef35d1.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="901" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-949425" /><br/>
The new &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; offers a considerably thinner design and slightly larger 11- and 13-inch display size options. The 11-inch model is 5.3mm thick and weighs less than a pound, while the 13-inch model is just 5.1mm thick and weighs a quarter pound less than its predecessor. Apple notes that this makes the new &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; the thinnest Apple product ever. It features an improved thermal design thanks to graphite sheets in the main housing and copper in the Apple logo.<br/>
<br/>
The &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj;'s Ultra Retina XDR OLED display uses two panels in a tandem design to deliver even better fullscreen brightness of up to 1,000 nits for SDR and HDR, and 1,600 nits of peak HDR brightness. It delivers deeper, true blacks, more detail in shadows and low light, brighter highlights and improved luminance, and it is more responsive to content in motion.<br/>
<br/>
The M4 chip is built with second-generation <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/3nm/">3nm</a> technology and features a new display engine, as well as hardware accelerated mesh shading and ray tracing. It delivers up to 50% faster CPU performance than the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m2/">M2</a> in the previous &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; and four-times faster rendering performance.<br/>
<br/>
The &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj;'s 12-megapixel front-facing camera has been moved to the side of the device for an improved video calling experience. The rear-camera now supports ProRes video recording and Smart HDR 4. It also now features an Adaptive TrueTone flash for better document scanning. <br/>
<br/>
The &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; is available with a nano-texture display option for the first time. The device's enclosure is made 100% recycled aluminum and it comes in Silver and Space Black.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple at its "Let Loose" event today <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2024/05/apple-unveils-the-redesigned-11-inch-and-all-new-13-inch-ipad-air-with-m2/">announced</a> new M2-powered iPad Air models in 11-inch and 13-inch sizes with a new landscape FaceTime camera, AI features, and better sound quality with the larger model. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/Apple-iPad-Air-hero-240507.jpg" alt="" width="1960" height="1400" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-949455" /><br/>
Apple says the iPad Air has been designed "to make features pioneered on iPad Pro at a more affordable price," with the brand new larger 13-inch model offering 30% more screen real estate than the 11-inch model.<br/>
<br/>
The M2 chip features a faster 8-core CPU and 10-core GPU. When combined with faster memory bandwidth, the new iPad Air is nearly 50% faster than the previous iPad Air with M1 for a wide range of productivity and creative tasks, according to Apple. And compared to iPad Air with A14 Bionic, the new M2 model delivers up to 3x faster performance. Apple also claims that the 13-inch model delivers better sound quality with double the bass than the previous generation.<br/>
<br/>
In addition, the new iPad Air supports Wi-Fi 6E, which provides up to 2x increased performance than the previous generation. It's also compatible with the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/07/apple-pencil-pro-announced/">new Apple Pencil Pro</a>, which features a new sensor in the barrel that can sense a user's squeeze, and brings up a tool palette to quickly switch tools, line weights, and colors, "all without interrupting the creative process," claims the company.<br/>
<br/>
Apple is touting the new iPad Air as "an incredibly powerful device for artificial intelligence." Unlike the previous generation, the 12MP Ultra Wide FaceTime camera on the devices is located along the longest edge so that it captures video from a more central, horizontal position during video calls. The camera also features Center Stage, which uses machine learning to automatically keep everyone in the field of view. <br/>
<br/>
The new iPad Air is nearly 50% faster than the previous iPad Air with M1, according to Apple. Compared to iPad Air with A14 Bionic, it provides 3x faster performance. Apple says the new models are also compatible with the latest Apple Pencil Pro and Magic Keyboard, with Apple Pencil Hover support for greater precision. <br/>
<br/>
The new iPad Air models feature an LCD Liquid Retina display, and both sizes come in several colors including new blue, new purple, Starlight and Space Grey, and a new 100% recycled aluminum enclosure. <br/>
<blockquote>"So many users — from students, to content creators, to small businesses, and more — love iPad Air for its performance, portability, and versatility, all at an affordable price. Today, iPad Air gets even better," said Bob Borchers, Apple's vice president of Product Marketing. "We're so excited to introduce the redesigned 11-inch and all-new 13-inch iPad Air, offering two sizes for the first time. With its combination of a brilliant Liquid Retina display, the phenomenal performance of the M2 chip, incredible AI capabilities, and its colorful, portable design with support for new accessories, iPad Air is more powerful and versatile than ever."</blockquote><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/Apple-iPad-Air-color-lineup-240507.jpg" alt="" width="964" height="1284" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-949464" /><br/>
<br/>
A new Smart Folio for iPad Air attaches magnetically and supports multiple viewing angles for greater flexibility. Available in charcoal gray, light violet, denim, and sage, the new Smart Folio also complements the finishes of the latest iPad Air.<br/>
<br/>
The iPad Air is available starting with 128GB of storage, with more storage options including 256GB, 512GB, and 1TB. Like the previous models, the iPad Air starts at &#36;599, while the 13-inch device starts at &#36;799. They can be ordered today, and shipping starts next week.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/">iPad Air </a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/may-2024-apple-event/">May 2024 Apple Event</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPad-Air">iPad Air (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipad.137">iPad</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/07/apple-announces-ipad-air-models-in-new-11-13-inch/">Apple Announces New M2 iPad Air Models in  11-Inch and 13-Inch Sizes From &#36;599</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-announces-new-m2-ipad-air-models-in-11-inch-and-13-inch-sizes-from-599.2425608/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-car/">canceled</a> its Apple Car project in February 2024 and stopped all internal work on autonomous, electric vehicles. But the company still has its sights set on impacting the EV market, and Rivian could be the avenue for its ambitions, according to rumors out of Taiwan.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/08/tim-cook-apple-car.jpeg" alt="" width="1280" height="720" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-813754" /><div class="center-wrap"><em>Apple canceled its "Project Titan" EV project earlier this year.</em></div><br/>
<em><a href="https://www.digitimes.com/news/a20240506PD216/apple-ev-startup-genai.html">DigiTimes</a></em> reports that Apple is "studying the possibility" of a partnership with Rivian, although this seems to be based on speculation within the supply chain, and what form such a collab would take remains a mystery.<br/>
<br/>
The report notes that a sluggish EV market has left many startups struggling for survival, yet Rivian's <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/transportation/everything-you-need-to-know-about-amazons-electric-delivery-vans-from-rivian">delivery vehicle partnership with Amazon</a> remains strong, and could even factor into Apple's interest. From the report: <br/>
<blockquote>"A partnership with Rivian might also indirectly involve Amazon, which could open the door to collaboration between Apple and Amazon in generative AI, the sources said."</blockquote>The report links Apple’s <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/artificial-intelligence/">generative AI ambitions</a> with the rumor, tying it to innovations within the EV space such as AI smart voice and driving assistance. It's all very speculative. <br/>
<br/>
Some sort of basic <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/carplay/">CarPlay</a> integration could be fueling the chatter, and there could be nothing more behind it. It's worth noting that Rivian is also under market pressure to perform during the mass production phase of its latest fleet of <a href="https://stories.rivian.com">midsize R2 and R3 cars</a>, so this rumor could just be part of an attempt to revive shareholder interest. On that basis, it would be wise to quell expectations until other reports corroborate the claim.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/rivian/">Rivian</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/07/apple-car-interest-revived-by-rivian-partnership/">Apple Car Interest Revived by Rivian Partnership Rumor</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-car-interest-revived-by-rivian-partnership-rumor.2425603/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple will unveil its new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a> lineup in a range of new colors later this year in the fall. Here are all the rumored colors so far for the four models: &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj;, &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; Plus, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/">iPhone 16 Pro</a>, and &zwnj;iPhone 16 Pro&zwnj; Max.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/iPhone-16-Camera-Lozenge-2.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-935160" /><br/>
<br/>
<h2>iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus</h2><br/>
In the last few years, ‌<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>‌ lineups have launched with five color options. This year, however, Apple could buck that trend for the 6.1-inch &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; and 6.7-inch &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; Plus. At least one of the standard models will come in more color options than ever before, claims one rumor.<br/>
<br/>
According to the Weibo-based leaker "Fixed focus digital," Apple's upcoming larger 6.7-inch &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; Plus model will come in as many as seven colors that either build upon the existing five colors in the standard <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a> lineup, or recast them in a new finish.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/iPhone-16-Lozenge-2-Isolated-Colors.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-949017" /><br/>
The following table shows the existing &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; Plus color options alongside the colors rumored for the &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; Plus:<br/>
<table class="comparison"><br/>
 <tr><br/>
 <th>&zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; Plus (2023)</th><br/>
 <th>&zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; Plus (2024)</th><br/>
 </tr><br/>
 <tr><br/>
 <td>Blue</td><br/>
 <td>Blue</td><br/>

 </tr><br/>
<tr><br/>
 <td>–</td><br/>
 <td><strong>Purple</strong></td><br/>
 </tr><br/>
</table><br/>
<div class="clear"></div><br/>
The leaker in question did not provide any more context for the rumor beyond the model name, therefore it is not clear if they are claiming that the seven color options are exclusive to the &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; Plus. <br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, the leaker may have only seen materials for the larger device in the supply chain, in which case the same colors could also be coming to the smaller 6.1-inch &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj;. Given that the two models are expected to be identical apart from their size difference, this possibility seems the most likely. <br/>
<br/>
Note that this is the first rumor we have received about potential colors for the standard &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; models, and the leaker has an unproven track record for accurate leaks, so the alleged colors need corroboration from other sources before we can definitively say they are coming. <br/>
<br/>
<h2>iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/iPhone-15-Pro-Lineup-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-911423" /><br/>
Apple typically chooses four, cooler-toned colors for its &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; Pro models. For last year's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a> and &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; Max, for example, Apple introduced a titanium chassis that came in four muted finishes: Natural Titanium, Blue Titanium, White Titanium, and Black Titanium.  <br/>
<br/>
According to <a href="https://x.com/VNchocoTaco/status/1772522408144191732?s=20">one rumor out of China</a>, the existing Blue Titanium color will be dropped from the &zwnj;iPhone 16 Pro&zwnj; lineup in favor of a new "rose" titanium color, while Black Titanium will allegedly be replaced with a "space black" color, which is said to be similar to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-14/">iPhone 14</a> Pro color of the same name.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/iphone-16-pro-colors-rumor.jpeg" alt="" width="1386" height="2048" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-943306" /><br/>
Additionally, the same source claims that the Natural and White Titanium colors will be slightly different on the &zwnj;iPhone 16 Pro&zwnj; models. Natural Titanium is said to be returning, but with more of a gray tint to it. Meanwhile, White Titanium will appear more like a "silver white" color, which is also said to be similar to the silver version of the &zwnj;iPhone 14&zwnj; Pro.<br/>
<br/>
Last year, Apple surprised some &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; fans by not offering a gold option. Gold was available through the ‌‌&zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;‌‌ 5S to the ‌‌&zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;‌‌ 8, and then on the ‌‌&zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;‌‌ XS to the ‌‌&zwnj;iPhone 14&zwnj;‌‌ Pro. Given the popularity of gold, the rumored new "rose" color could well be the titanium version of a gold-like shade.<br/>
<br/>
According to a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/19/iphone-16-pro-two-new-color-options/">rumor from another source</a>, the &zwnj;iPhone 16 Pro&zwnj; models will be available in "Desert Titanium" and "Titanium Gray" color options. These names suggest there could be some overlap with the separately rumored rose color and the tweaked Natural Titanium.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/iphone-16-pro-colors-graybg.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-937186" /><br/>
In another twist, a recent <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/29/iphone-16-pro-new-polished-titanium-finish/">rumor out of Korea</a> claimed that Apple's upcoming &zwnj;iPhone 16 Pro&zwnj; models will use an improved process for finishing and coloring titanium.  According to the source, the new process will make the ‌&zwnj;iPhone 16 Pro&zwnj;‌ and ‌&zwnj;iPhone 16 Pro&zwnj;‌ Max look more polished than the &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; models, which have a brushed finish.<br/>
<table class="comparison"><br/>
 <tr><br/>
 <th>&zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; (2023)</th><br/>
 <th>&zwnj;iPhone 16 Pro&zwnj; (2024)</th><br/>
 </tr><br/>
 <tr><br/>
 <td>Natural Titanium</td><br/>
 <td>Natural Titanium</td><br/>
 </tr><br/>
 <tr><br/>
 <td>Blue Titanium</td><br/>
 <td><strong>Rose / Desert Titanium</strong></td><br/>
 </tr><br/>
<tr><br/>
 <td>White Titanium</td><br/>
 <td><strong>Silver / White Titanium</strong></td><br/>
 </tr><br/>
 <tr><br/>
 <td>Black Titanium</td><br/>
 <td><strong>Space Black Titanium</strong></td><br/>
 </tr><br/>
</table><br/>
<div class="clear"></div><br/>
The improved manufacturing process will allegedly result in a glossy appearance that is more akin to the heavily polished stainless steel material used in earlier Pro devices before the &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; series. However, the new titanium finish will be less prone to scratches compared to stainless steel.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Summing Up</h2><br/>
As of writing this, we are still around five months away from Apple announcing the &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; series, so a lot can change in the meantime, and we could see additional rumors that corroborate or conflict with those we have uncovered so far. Either way, we will keep this article up-to-date with any subsequent developments, so be sure to check back.<br/>
