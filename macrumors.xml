<br/>
<h2>Apple Introduces Updated AirPods Pro and EarPods With USB-C and More</h2><br/>
In addition to the iPhone 15 models getting a USB-C port, Apple announced that the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/12/apple-announces-usb-c-iphone-airpods-earpods/">second-generation AirPods Pro are now available to order with a USB-C charging case</a> for &#36;249, and the wired EarPods headphones now come in a USB-C version as well.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a> lineup noticeably lacks a model with a display size below six inches, just two years after Apple extolled the virtues of a 5.4-inch device. So why did Apple eliminate the "mini" device that some <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> customers had come to love?<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/04/iPhone-mini-wonder-feature-yellow.jpg" alt="" width="1444" height="812" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-794050" /><br/>
Apple debuted the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-12/">iPhone 12 mini</a> in 2020 following years of calls from &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; fans for the company to offer a small-screen device with the latest features. When Apple did so, it was assumed that the small form factor would persist for several years, but the device came to a seemingly premature end upon the release of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-14/">iPhone 14</a> lineup in 2022. Upon the release of the &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; lineup, Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/12/apple-discontinues-iphone-13-mini/">retired the last remaining device</a> with the "mini" form factor.<br/>
<br/>
Concerns first arose when the &zwnj;iPhone 12 mini&zwnj; appeared to not be selling as well as Apple had hoped, making up just six percent of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-12/">iPhone 12</a> sales in the U.S. in October and November 2020, according to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/05/iphone-12-mini-sales-lackluster-cirp/">data gathered by Consumer Intelligence Research Partners</a> (CIRP). <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/09/iphone-12-mini-low-january-sales/">Counterpoint Research</a> reported that the &zwnj;iPhone 12 mini&zwnj; accounted for only five percent of all &zwnj;iPhone 12&zwnj; sales in the U.S. in the first half of January 2021.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/20/production-shifting-from-iphone-12-mini-to-pro/">Morgan Stanley believed</a> that Apple chose to cut production of the &zwnj;iPhone 12 mini&zwnj; by two million units to create more manufacturing capacity for the more popular &zwnj;iPhone 12&zwnj; Pro. This was mirrored by a Taiwanese report, citing supply chain sources, which <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/22/poor-iphone-12-mini-sales-supply-chain/">said</a> that strong demand for ‌&zwnj;iPhone 12&zwnj; Pro‌ models in China led Apple to increase its supply of the more expensive devices.<br/>
<br/>
Most strikingly, JP Morgan Chase <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/09/iphone-12-mini-low-january-sales/">claimed</a> that Apple outright halted &zwnj;iPhone 12 mini&zwnj; production in the second quarter of 2021. While the sales reports for the &zwnj;iPhone 12 mini&zwnj; did not bode well for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-13/">iPhone 13</a> mini, Apple plans its &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; production and supply chain operations well in advance of launch, meaning that the &zwnj;iPhone 13&zwnj; mini was already well on the way to production by the time the issues with the &zwnj;iPhone 12 mini&zwnj;'s sales were clear.<br/>
<br/>
In April 2022, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/04/21/iphone-13-mini-unpopular-march-quarter/">CIRP released more data</a> suggesting that the &zwnj;iPhone 13&zwnj; mini accounted for just 3 percent of &zwnj;iPhone 13&zwnj; sales – half that of the &zwnj;iPhone 12 mini&zwnj;. These continued poor sales were likely the main reason behind the demise of the "mini" form factor &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
With the &zwnj;iPhone 14&zwnj; lineup, Apple opted to replace the "mini" device with an all-new "Plus" device that matched the 6.7-inch display size of its high-end "Pro Max" models. In some respects, the "Plus" mirrors the "mini," offering the latest &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;'s features in a different display size. Instead of offering a lightweight small-screen option, customers can now choose an even bigger battery and 6.7-inch display – the same size that "Pro Max" customers have been used to for over five years, now at a price of &#36;1,199 – but at a much more accessible &#36;899 price point.<br/>
<br/>
Less than a week after the launch of the &zwnj;iPhone 14&zwnj;, Apple analyst <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/">Ming-Chi Kuo</a> said that <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/09/12/kuo-iphone-14-plus-worse-than-iphone-13-mini/">demand for the two devices was "lackluster,"</a> with worse pre-order results than the third-generation <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-se/">iPhone SE</a> and the &zwnj;iPhone 13&zwnj; mini. He went as far as to claim that "Apple's product segmentation strategy for standard models fails this year" and Apple was believed to have <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/09/28/apple-reverses-iphone-14-plan-boost-production/">shelved plans</a> to increase production of the two devices. Display analyst Ross Young said panel orders for the ‌&zwnj;iPhone 14&zwnj;‌ <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/09/30/more-signs-of-low-iphone-14-demand-emerge/">were down 38 percent</a> versus the ‌&zwnj;iPhone 13&zwnj;‌ at the same time last year, while in the resale market, the &zwnj;iPhone 14&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPhone 14&zwnj; Plus <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/09/30/more-signs-of-low-iphone-14-demand-emerge/">lost their value twice as fast</a> as the &zwnj;iPhone 13&zwnj; mini and &zwnj;iPhone 13&zwnj; from the previous year.<br/>
<br/>
Other reports from the likes of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/10/13/iphone-14-plus-sales-lower-than-expected/"><em>DigiTimes</em></a> overwhelmingly presented the same picture of low &zwnj;iPhone 14&zwnj; Plus sales, to the extent that Apple was <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/10/20/apple-slashes-iphone-14-plus-orders/">forced to slash production</a>, suggesting that the low sales of the &zwnj;iPhone 12 mini&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPhone 13&zwnj; mini may not have been caused by the device's size after all. Whether the &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; Plus will fare better is yet to be seen.<br/>
<br/>
There are no plans to revive the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;'s "mini" form factor in Apple's pipeline, according to rumors. The smallest iPhones in the works, such as next year's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a> and the fourth-generation &zwnj;iPhone SE&zwnj;, are expected to feature 6.1-inch displays. On the contrary, some future devices, such as the &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; Pro and &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; Pro Max, are expected to grow even larger, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/12/larger-displays-exclusive-iphone-16-pro/">increasing to 6.3- and 6.9-inches</a>, respectively.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/16/there-is-no-iphone-15-mini/">There Is No iPhone 15 Mini: Here&#039;s Why</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/there-is-no-iphone-15-mini-heres-why.2402241/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<title>Developers Working With Apple to Bring iPhone 15 Pro&#039;s Console Games to the iPad and Mac</title>

		<description><![CDATA[Developers are working with Apple to bring the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a>'s console games to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> and Mac, Apple executives told <em>IGN</em>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/Mac-Gaming.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-899793" /><br/>
In a new <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/apple-iphone-15-pro-gaming-interview">interview</a>, Jeremy Sandmel, Apple's Senior Director of GPU Software, and Tim Millet, Apple's VP of Platform Architecture, discussed the &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj;'s more advanced gaming capabilities. During the announcement of the &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; models, Apple highlighted how the A17 Pro chip features a brand new GPU with hardware-accelerated ray tracing, enabling console games like "Resident Evil 4" and "Assassin's Creed: Mirage" to be played on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Asked if these new games will be compatible with Apple silicon iPads and Macs, Millet said that "The developers are going to work with us to do it." Sandmel added:<blockquote>...one of the things that fundamentally enabled that is this unification of the architecture of Apple Silicon and the iPhone Silicon and the iPad Silicon. And so you can see that they're able to do exactly what you just suggested, which is bring a game to iPhone and Mac that is the same game. It's the same rendering, it's the same rendering quality and it's the same game they had on a gaming PC and a console.<br/>
<br/>
So we really look at these many generations of SoC architecture across the phone, across the iPad, across now, Apple Silicon Macs. And we'd see that as part of one big unified platform, a graphics and gaming platform in particular.</blockquote>Since these console games are purportedly enabled by the hardware advancements of the A17 Pro, Apple's first chip fabricated with TSMC's 3-nanometer process, it seems possible that Apple is alluding to next-generation iPads and Macs with M3 chips here.<br/>
<br/>
DisplayPort support is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/13/all-iphone-15-models-support-displayport/">built into the USB-C port</a> on all <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a> models, meaning that the devices can output video at up to 4K/60Hz natively to a DisplayPort-equipped external display or TV with a supported USB-C to DisplayPort cable. On previous iPhones with a Lightning port, video mirroring is limited to 1080p with Apple's Lightning-to-HDMI or Lightning-to-VGA adapters.<br/>
<br/>
Asked if, given the device's DisplayPort capabilities, &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; owners would be be able to play the likes of Resident Evil 4 on an external display, Sandmel replied:<blockquote>As you probably know, there's the display resolution and then there's the gaming resolution, and then the frame rates, the game rendering. With technologies like MetalFX's upscaling, we can sort of separate those two things. The game can run at really high frame rates, get really great quality results, and then upscale whatever resolution the display, whether that's the iPhone display, whether that's an external display. So yes, the iPhone can connect to these 4K displays, and it can drive them externally doing whatever you do on the phone, including gaming to these other displays. The resolution and frame rate are going to highly depend on what the game's actually doing.</blockquote>The &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; does not yet offer a dedicated extended display mode, but it is possible to mirror an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; to an external display via a wired connection, as well as <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airplay/">AirPlay</a>.

		<description><![CDATA[During Apple's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/12/everything-apple-announced-fall-2023-event/">"Wonderlust" event</a> earlier this week, Apple claimed that the ‌iPhone 15 Pro‌ camera system "pushes the limits of what you can capture with a smartphone." It was a reference to the device's support for "spatial computing video," but the mention was brief and lacking detail.<br/>
<br/>

For those who missed it, spatial video is Apple's name for what is essentially 3D video. The iPhone 15 Pro is able to record spatial videos natively by combining video captured by the sensors of the Main and Ultra Wide cameras, which results in something akin to stereoscopic video.<br/>
<br/>
This 3D video can then be played back using Apple's "spatial computing" Vision Pro headset when it's released early next year, allowing users to relive these memories in a fully immersive way. Apple didn't say, but presumably the iPhone 15 Pro can also capture spatial photo stills using similar camera processing.<br/>
<br/>
Other questions remain that Apple's senior VP of worldwide marketing Greg "Joz" Joswiak didn't answer during his whirlwind tour of the iPhone 15 Pro's new camera capabilities, which include the ability to record 4K ProRes video at 60 frames per second, as well as 5x optical zoom on the iPhone 15 Pro Max.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/spatial-video-apple-visioin-pro.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="898" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-911687" /><br/>
It's not clear for example what kind of unique file format these spatial videos will use, nor did Apple mention how large they will be. Presumably, iPhone 15 Pro users will need to select a special new mode in the Camera app to capture spatial video. How these videos will be saved in the Photos app, and whether they will be playable on the iPhone in any way, is also unknown.<br/>
<br/>
Apple will undoubtedly reveal the answers to these questions soon enough. The ability to shoot spatial video using an iPhone 15 Pro isn't available yet, but it's "coming later this year," according to the company.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/september-2023-apple-event/">September 2023 Apple Event</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/spatial-video/">spatial video</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-15-Pro">iPhone 15 Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-vision-pro.209">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/16/apple-iphone-15-pro-spatial-video-vision-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro Cameras to Support Spatial Video Later This Year, But Key Questions Remain</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-15-pro-cameras-to-support-spatial-video-later-this-year-but-key-questions-remain.2402182/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple Savings account partner Goldman Sachs has changed its system to prevent <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-card/">Apple Card</a> customers from running into extended delays when attempting to withdraw money, reports <em><a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/goldman-makes-adjustments-to-fix-apple-savings-account-problems">The Information</a></em>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/04/apple-card-savings-account-16x9.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-892213" /><br/>
When the Apple Savings account launched earlier this year, there <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/06/01/apple-savings-money-withdrawal-issues/">were complaints from customers</a> who had long wait times when trying to withdraw money from their accounts. Some people had to wait weeks for money transfers, and in some cases, money disappeared between banks. Goldman Sachs at the time said that the transfers were delayed because of security flags that were meant to help protect user accounts.<br/>
<br/>
Goldman Sachs has since adjusted its system to make it less likely to flag legitimate customer withdrawal requests as problematic. According to <em>The Information</em>, when a customer with a large amount of money attempts to move a small portion of their cash to an outside account, Goldman Sachs will be less likely to flag the transaction.<br/>
<br/>
There is also now a cap on the number of days that a withdrawal should take, and Goldman Sachs is prioritizing communication with customers who have flagged transactions to ensure the communication issues that occurred earlier this year do not repeat.<br/>
<br/>
Goldman Sachs in July provided <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/07/17/apple-goldman-sachs-savings-customer-credit/">one-time &#36;100 credits</a> to customers who had experienced poor customer service as a gesture of good will.<br/>
<br/>
The Apple Savings account has been offered since April, and it is available solely to &zwnj;Apple Card&zwnj; holders. The account has a 4.15 percent interest rate on Daily Cash and other deposits.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-card/">Apple Card</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/15/goldman-sachs-apple-savings-overhaul/">Goldman Sachs Overhauls Apple Savings Procedures to Cut Down on Withdrawal Delays</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/goldman-sachs-overhauls-apple-savings-procedures-to-cut-down-on-withdrawal-delays.2402045/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple this morning began accepting pre-orders for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a>, &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; Plus, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a>, and &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; Max, and now just hours later, the first orders have moved into the "preparing to ship" phase as Apple prepares to send the new iPhones out to customers.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/iphone-15-preparing-to-ship.jpg" alt="" width="1901" height="1069" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-911633" /><br/>
Customers in the United States should soon be able to begin tracking their orders through <a href="https://www.ups.com/us/en/track/ups-my-choice.page">the UPS My Choice feature</a>, or through the UPS website <a href="https://www.ups.com/track?loc=en_US&amp;requester=ST/">using a reference number</a> like a phone number or the Apple order number. Orders typically ship from China and Apple does not change the shipping status until they are scanned into a central distribution hub in the United States.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> shipments will begin arriving to customers on Friday, September 22. As with every new product release, Apple users in Australia and New Zealand will be the first to get their orders due to time zone differences.<br/>
<br/>
&zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; Max models <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/15/iphone-15-pro-shipping-estimates-october/">began selling out</a> within an hour after pre-orders went live this morning, and orders for some colors and capacities are now delayed until October or November. Some locations may still have pre-order stock available for in-store pickup, and those who were not able to place a pre-order in time may be able to just go to the store on launch day to pick up a new device, as Apple often has extra stock for in-store purchases.<br/>
<br/>
Cases and accessories are expected to arrive before the new iPhones and have already begun shipping out.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-15">iPhone 15 (Buy Now)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-15-Pro">iPhone 15 Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99">iPhone</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/15/apple-iphone-15-preorders-preparing-to-ship/">Some iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Pro Pre-Orders Now &#039;Preparing to Ship&#039; Ahead of September 22 Launch</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/some-iphone-15-and-iphone-15-pro-pre-orders-now-preparing-to-ship-ahead-of-september-22-launch.2402035/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today shared a new <a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/transparency/pdf/requests-2022-H1-en.pdf">Transparency Report</a> providing information on customer data requests that the company received from the U.S. government in the first half of 2022.<br/>
<br/>

For the first time ever, Apple has reported the total number of "geofence requests" that it received from the U.S. government. These requests are meant to include specific latitude and longitudes coordinates for a specified time period, but Apple does not collect this information as part of its commitment to customer privacy, and therefore does not provide it to law enforcement, while fully respecting the legal process.<br/>
<br/>
From the Transparency Report:<blockquote>Apple may also receive requests from government agencies seeking customer data related to specific latitude and longitudes coordinates (geofence) for a specified time period. Apple does not have any data to provide in response to geofence requests.</blockquote>For additional information, the Transparency Report is <a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/transparency/pdf/requests-2022-H1-en.pdf">available on Apple's website</a> as a PDF.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/15/apple-transparency-report-geofence-requests/">Apple&#039;s Latest Transparency Report Includes Geofence Requests From U.S. Government</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apples-latest-transparency-report-includes-geofence-requests-from-u-s-government.2402030/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<title>Apple Watch Ultra 2 Advertised With 72-Hour Battery Life in Low Power Mode, But There&#039;s a Catch</title>

		<description><![CDATA[While the Apple Watch Ultra 2 is <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2023/09/apple-unveils-apple-watch-ultra-2/">advertised</a> with up to 72 hours of battery life in Low Power Mode, compared to 60 hours for the original Ultra model, there is a catch.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/Apple-Watch-Ultra-2-hero-230912.jpg" alt="" width="2880" height="1620" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-910333" /><br/>
According to fine print on Apple's website, the testing parameters for the Ultra 2 in Low Power Mode were different than those for the original Ultra.<br/>
<br/>
The fine print for the original Apple Watch Ultra said:<blockquote>Multi-day adventure battery life is based on the following use while in Low Power Mode and with workout settings enabled for fewer GPS and heart rate readings: 15 hours of hiking workout, over 600 time checks, 35 minutes of app use, 3 minutes of talk, and 15 hours of sleep tracking, over the course of 60 hours.</blockquote>The fine print for the Apple Watch Ultra 2 says:<blockquote>Battery life in Low Power Mode is based on the following use: 360 time checks, 360 notifications, 180 minutes of app use, and two 60-minute workouts with music playback from Apple Watch via Bluetooth, over the course of 72 hours.</blockquote>Given these very different testing parameters, customers should keep in mind that the Ultra 2 does not simply offer 12 hours more battery life than the original Ultra in Low Power Mode, which is something that could be easily misconstrued.<br/>
<br/>
It's possible the original Ultra would also get around 72 hours of battery life in Low Power Mode based on the new testing parameters, but this is not proven yet.<br/>
<br/>

		<title>Apple Watch Series 9 and Ultra 2 Battery Capacities Revealed in Regulatory Database</title>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple does not list battery capacities for the new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/12/apple-watch-series-9-unveiled/">Apple Watch Series 9</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/12/apple-announces-apple-watch-ultra-2/">Ultra 2</a> models, but <em>MacRumors</em> has discovered this information in a Chinese regulatory database today, and we have outlined our findings below.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/Apple-Watch-Series-9.jpg" alt="" width="2880" height="1620" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-910331" /><br/>
According to the database, which only provides Apple model numbers instead of product names, the 41mm and 45mm Apple Watch Series 9 models appear to be equipped with 282 mAh and 308 mAh batteries, respectively. These capacities are unchanged compared to the equivalent Apple Watch Series 8 models, which makes sense given that Apple says the Series 9 models have the same 18-hour battery life as Series 8 models.<br/>
<br/>
As for the Apple Watch Ultra 2, it appears to be equipped with a 564 mAh battery, which is approximately 4% larger than the 542 mAh battery in the original Apple Watch Ultra. However, Apple says the Ultra 2 has the same 36-hour battery life as the original Ultra, likely due to it having a brighter display and other new features.<br/>
<br/>
A recap of the Apple Watch battery capacities listed in the database:<p><table class="comparison"><br/>

New features for both the Apple Watch Series 9 and Ultra 2 include brighter displays, a faster S9 chip, a new "Double Tap" gesture for interacting with the watches without touching the screen, and more. Both new models have been available to order since Tuesday and will begin arriving to customers and launch in stores on Friday, September 22.<br/>
<br/>
<em>MacRumors</em> also found the same battery capacities for what appears to be the iPhone 15 Plus, iPhone 15 Pro, and iPhone 15 Pro Max as <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/15/iphone-15-battery-capacities-revealed/">were reported earlier today</a>.

Speck is well-known for its range of case options for Apple's iPhones, and though the &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; models have just been announced this week, Speck is ready with a <a href="https://speckproducts.com/pages/search?q=iphone%2015">whole iPhone 15 case lineup</a> and a selection of <a href="https://speckproducts.com/collections/clicklock-no-slip-interlock-for-magsafe">ClickLock MagSafe grips and mounts</a> that work with the cases.<br/>
<br/>
If you're not a fan of Apple's new FineWoven cases or don't care for the color options that Apple has available, Speck has debuted <a href="https://speckproducts.com/pages/search?q=iphone%2015">169 new cases</a> that are available in 17 different designs and 20 colors for all four of the new &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; models. The cases are available for purchase now <a href="https://speckproducts.com/pages/search?q=iphone%2015">from Speck's website</a> and from BestBuy retail locations and <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/">the BestBuy website</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Speck has three types of cases that users can choose from, including standard (with no <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe-battery-pack/">MagSafe</a>), &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj;, and ClickLock for &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj;, which works with ClickLock accessories. Prices range from &#36;25 to &#36;50, and there are options for every aesthetic. The <a href="https://speckproducts.com/products/presidio2-pro-magsafe-with-clicklock-iphone-15-pro-cases">Presido2 Pro</a>, for example, has Speck's Armor Cloud technology and protects the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> from drops as high as 13 feet while still looking stylish, plus it works with &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; accessories.<br/>
<br/>

The <a href="https://speckproducts.com/products/presidio2-grip-magsafe-with-clicklock-iphone-15-cases">Presidio2 Grip</a>, one of Speck's most popular options, has the same 13-foot drop protection while also offering no-slip inverted grips. This version is 20 percent slimmer than previous versions of the Grip case, it has &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj;, and it comes in a range of color options that look great with Apple's new iPhones.<br/>
<br/>

If you want protection but don't want to cover up the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;'s design, Speck has the <a href="https://speckproducts.com/collections/iphone-15-cases-for-2023/products/presidio-perfect-clear-grip-magsafe-with-clicklock-iphone-15-cases">Presidio Perfect-Clear Grip MagSafe case</a> with no-slip grips, 13-foot drop protection, and stylish grooves at the sides. If you're not a fan of that no-slip look, there's also a <a href="https://speckproducts.com/collections/iphone-15-cases-for-2023/products/presidio-perfect-clear-magsafe-with-clicklock-iphone-15-cases">Presidio Perfect-Clear case</a> that has a smoother finish.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/speck-perfect-clear-grip.jpg" alt="" width="1400" height="1209" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-911304" /><br/>
These cases all work with ClickLock, a technology Speck has designed to prevent accidental separation of iPhones and &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; accessories by adding a magnetic interlock mechanism. Speck this week came out with three new ClickLock options that work with its cases and the &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; models, including the Car Vent Mount, the <a href="https://speckproducts.com/collections/magsafe-accessories/products/wallet-for-magsafe-with-clicklock?variant=43285595455619">Wallet</a>, and the StandyGrip.<br/>
<br/>
Priced at &#36;30, <a href="https://speckproducts.com/collections/magsafe-accessories/products/wallet-for-magsafe-with-clicklock?variant=43285595455619">Speck's MagSafe Wallet</a> is definitely a product where you want ClickLock because a wallet is the last thing you want to slip off of your &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;. Available in several colors, the Wallet holds 1-3 credit, debit, or ID cards.<br/>
<br/>

The &#36;30 <a href="https://speckproducts.com/collections/magsafe-accessories/products/standygrip-for-magsafe-stand-and-grip-combo-with-clicklock">StandyGrip with MagSafe and ClickLock</a> holds the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; upright in a horizontal or vertical viewing position and it can be used to attach the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; to a MacBook so it can serve as a webcam, and that's also a situation where a secure attachment is crucial.<br/>

Speck also has the &#36;40 <a href="https://speckproducts.com/collections/magsafe-accessories/products/car-vent-mount-for-magsafe-with-clicklock">Car Vent Mount for MagSafe with ClickLock</a> that attaches to a car vent and has a built-in cable holder. It uses ClickLock to ensure that your &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; isn't going to go flying off of the mount when you hit a bump.

Speck and Best Buy, the giveaway's sponsors, are providing a 128GB &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; and a selection of accessories to go with it, including a Presidio2 Grip Case, a Presidio Perfect Clear Grip Case, and a Presidio Perfect Clear Case, all of which have both &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; and ClickLock. Speck is also adding in its Wallet for &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; with ClickLock, its StandyGrip for &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; Stand, and its Car Vent Mount for &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; with ClickLock.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Following Apple's "Wonderlust" event, Justine Ezarik joins us on this week's episode of <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/iphone-15-and-apple-watch-series-9-first-impressions/id1602394741?i=1000628022007">The MacRumors Show</a> to talk through our reactions to the announcement of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-watch-series-9/">Apple Watch Series 9</a>, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch-ultra/">Apple Watch Ultra 2</a>.<br/>

Justine and Dan attended this week's event at <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-park/">Apple Park</a> and were able to spend some time with the new devices. They talk us through how the new, contoured design and frosted glass of the &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; Plus feel in the hand and look in-person, as well as just how much smaller and lighter the &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; Max really feel due to their titanium design. We also discuss experiences of using the &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj;'s Action button and Double Tap on the &zwnj;Apple Watch Series 9&zwnj;, the new selection of color options, some of our favorite new features, and more.

		<description><![CDATA[CalDigit's <a href="https://www.caldigit.com/thunderbolt-station-4/">Thunderbolt Station 4</a> (TS4) is a dock with 98W charging power and an impressive array of 18 ports, ideal for Mac setups with a wide range of connection requirements.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/caldigit-ts4-main.jpeg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-909894" /><br/>
The dock comes with a price tag of &#36;399.99, reflective of its high-speed data transfer, expansive connectivity, and powerful charging abilities. While it may not be the most budget-friendly option on the market, its performance and convenience make a compelling case for professionals with demanding workloads and complex Mac setups. In this review, we delve into the TS4's capabilities to determine whether its cost is justified, and help you understand if it is the right fit for your specific needs.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/caldigit-ts4-connected.jpeg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-909892" /><br/>
The dock comes with a 0.8m Thunderbolt 4 Cable, two rubber feet strips, one power cord, one 230W power supply, and a two-year CalDigit warranty.<br/>
<br/>
<h3>Design</h3><br/>
The CalDigit TS4 dock features a high-quality, durable aluminum design. Its overall footprint is reasonably compact, measuring 141mm x 42mm x 113mm, meaning that it avoids taking too much space on a desk. If that is too tall for your desktop, just slide on the included pair of rubber strips for cushioning and tip the dock over on its side. The aluminum casing has a ribbed design that gives it a more industrial look while also offering some extra surface area for effective heat dissipation.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/caldigit-ts4-sideways.jpeg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-909897" /><br/>
The TS4's design, despite its compactness, does not compromise on functionality. It houses an impressive total of 18 ports that are logically divided between the front and rear of the dock. The front features easily accessible USB-C, USB-A, and SD card slots, alongside an audio input and output port. The back, meanwhile, is equipped with the remaining ports, including Thunderbolt 4, USB-C, USB-A, DisplayPort, and Ethernet.<br/>
<br/>
The dock is accompanied by a large power brick that, while necessary for its function, detracts slightly from the portability of the device and is an important consideration in terms of cable management.<br/>
<br/>
<h3>USB Ports</h3><br/>
The dock is outfitted with a total of eight USB ports, split between USB-C and USB-A variants. There are three 10Gb/s USB-C ports (two located conveniently on the front and one at the back), offering high-speed data transfer rates and power delivery. The dock also features five 10Gb/s USB-A ports to accommodate slightly older hardware. Four of these ports are located on the back of the device, and one is placed on the front for easy access.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/caldigit-ts4-rear-closeup.jpeg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-909895" /><br/>
One notable advantage is that the USB ports also deliver power sufficient for charging. One of the front USB-C ports delivers 20W, suitable for a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe-battery-pack/">MagSafe</a> charger or even a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod-mini/">HomePod mini</a>. The two rear Thunderbolt ports can supply 15W, while the remaining USB-C and USB-A ports offer 7.5W. This means that even in the absence of the host computer, many of the ports will continue to supply power to your devices, effectively turning the TS4 into a handy charging station.<br/>
<br/>
<h3>SD Card Slots</h3><br/>
Two slots accommodate both full-size SD and microSD cards, with UHS-II support ensuring adequate data transfer rates for photographers or videographers. The positioning of these slots on the front of the TS4 is another thoughtful touch, enabling easy access and the quick swapping of cards.<br/>
<br/>
It is worth noting that these slots are UHS-II and not the latest UHS-III specification, which means they will not offer the absolute highest transfer speeds available on the market for users with UHS-III cards. Despite this, UHS-II is still more than fast enough for the vast majority of users.<br/>
<br/>
<h3>Display Support</h3><br/>
The CalDigit TS4 offers comprehensive support for external displays, a feature that is particularly valuable for professionals who require multiple monitors for their workflow. The dock supports up to two 6K, 60Hz screens when connected via the Thunderbolt 4 ports, offering ample screen real estate. Moreover, if your requirements are focused on refresh rates, the TS4 can support up to 240Hz at a 1440p resolution. This makes it a perfect fit for graphic designers, video editors, and others who require high-resolution multi-monitor Mac setups.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/caldigit-ts4-rear.jpeg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-909896" /><br/>
In addition to the Thunderbolt 4 ports, the TS4 also includes a DisplayPort 1.4 port. DisplayPort 1.4 supports high resolutions and refresh rates, as well as features like HDR, making it an excellent choice for a wide range of displays. However, an HDMI port is noticeably absent on the device, which may be a drawback for those who rely on HDMI for their display setup, such as those using smaller OLED TVs as monitors.<br/>
<br/>
<h3>Ethernet</h3><br/>
A 2.5 Gigabit Ethernet port promises substantially faster data transfer rates compared to standard Gigabit Ethernet, offering solid performance. During use of the CalDigit TS4, the Ethernet port provided exceptional performance, delivering the highest speeds observed from the router, even when the other selection of ports were virtually maxed-out. <br/>
<br/>
<h3>Audio</h3><br/>
The CalDigit TS4 Thunderbolt dock comes equipped with three audio ports, including a 3.5mm audio in port, a 3.5mm audio out port, and a 3.5mm combo jack. This trio of audio ports allows for a versatile set of use cases, catering to both input and output needs.<br/>
<br/>
The 3.5mm combo port on the front is especially handy for quickly connecting headphones. The separate 3.5mm audio input and output ports offer even more flexibility, accommodating for standalone microphones and speakers. For instance, you can connect an external microphone for better voice capture quality during video calls or audio recordings. The dedicated output port allows you to connect speakers without having to frequently unplug your headphones.<br/>
<br/>
During testing, the audio ports on the CalDigit TS4 delivered clear and high-quality sound with no noticeable distortion or noise interference. The ease of access and the quality of the audio signal make these ports an excellent feature for those needing multiple audio connectivity options on their Thunderbolt dock.<br/>
<br/>
<h3>Final Thoughts</h3><br/>
Overall, the CalDigit TS4 offers best-in-class connectivity as a Thunderbolt dock with an extremely versatile selection of ports. With its convenient port placement, charging capabilities, and discreet design, it is a standout choice for those seeking a multitude of connection options. The ability to connect a single Thunderbolt cable to a MacBook and instantly activate two external displays and connect to over a dozen peripherals, and even charge devices regardless of whether a computer is attached, is extremely useful.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/caldigit-ts4-upright.jpeg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-909898" /><br/>
<br/>
While its bulky power supply and the omission of an HDMI port may be off-putting to some users, it still offers a wide variety of features that make it a strong competitor in the market. It is easy to recommend the TS4 to any Mac user looking to level-up their setup and meet a wide range of connectivity needs.<br/>
<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's new iPhone 15, iPhone 15 Plus, iPhone 15 Pro, and iPhone 15 Pro Max are equipped with a "completely standard" USB-C port without any restrictions on cables or accessories, according to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/09/contrary-to-rumors-the-iphone-15-has-a-standard-by-the-book-usb-c-port/"><em>Ars Technica</em>'s Andrew Cunningham</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/iPhone-15-USB-C-Port-Event-Still.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-910412" /><br/>
For previous iPhones with the Lightning connector, Apple limits the functionality of some cables and accessories that are not certified through its <a href="https://mfi.apple.com/">"Made for iPhone" program</a>. It was <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/02/28/iphone-15-usb-c-accessories-limited-without-mfi/">rumored</a> that Apple might apply similar limitations to the USB-C port on iPhone 15 models, but this report confirms that is not the case.<br/>
<br/>
As with iPads and Macs with USB-C ports, the report said all existing USB cables, chargers, and accessories will work normally with the iPhone 15 models.<br/>
<br/>
As the report notes, it is still possible that Apple will launch a "Made for iPhone" certification program for iPhone accessories with a USB-C port, but it appears that uncertified accessories will work just fine with the devices.<br/>
<br/>
All four iPhone 15 models are equipped with a USB-C port, but there are differences in data transfer speeds. The lower-end iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus are <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/12/iphone-15-usb-port-limited-to-lightning-speeds/">limited to USB 2.0 data transfer speeds</a> of up to 480 Mbps, which is equal to Lightning, while the iPhone 15 Pro models support USB 3 data transfer speeds of up to 10 Gbps.<br/>
<br/>
Apple began <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/15/iphone-15-preorders-now-available/">accepting pre-orders</a> for all four iPhone 15 models earlier today. The devices launch on Friday, September 22.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/usb-c/">USB-C</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-15">iPhone 15 (Buy Now)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-15-Pro">iPhone 15 Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99">iPhone</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/15/iphone-15-usb-c-port-completely-standard/">iPhone 15 Models Have &#039;Completely Standard&#039; USB-C Port Without Restrictions on Accessories</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-15-models-have-completely-standard-usb-c-port-without-restrictions-on-accessories.2401964/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a> and &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; Max are available in an entirely refreshed range of colors thanks to a new titanium design. The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a> and &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; families have different color options, so if you have your heart set on a particular shade, you may not be able to get your preferred model in that color. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/iPhone-15-Pro-Lineup-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-911423" /><br/>
The &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; Max are available in four colors, all of which are different from those <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone-14-pro-colors/">available</a> on last year's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-14-pro/">iPhone 14 Pro</a> models. This year's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> color options are quite different from those offered in previous years because the device now features a titanium frame with a brushed texture and contoured edges, as opposed to the polished stainless steel offered since 2017's &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; X. The &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; Max's four available color options are:<br/>
<br/>
<ul><br/>
<li>Black Titanium</li><br/>
<li>White Titanium</li><br/>
<li>Blue Titanium</li><br/>
<li>Natural Titanium</li><br/>
</ul><br/>
<br/>
The color option that Apple previously called "Silver," encompassing a design with silver metal and white glass, has been available on iPhones for over a decade. This is now "White Titanium" on the &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; Max. This shade has been tweaked to feature a slightly more beige back glass and softer overall tone.<br/>
<br/>
2022's "Space Black," which was previously "Graphite," is now simply "Black Titanium." It is more of an extremely rich, dark gray tone than deep black. Blue Titanium, on the other hand, appears to be more like navy blue, deeper than previous shades such as the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-12/">iPhone 12</a> Pro's Pacific Blue. Black and Blue Titanium may be more likely to attract fingerprints on account of their darker finish. Scratches, scuffs, and dents could also be more visible on these finishes than White or Natural Titanium.<br/>
<br/>
"Natural Titanium" is a wholly new shade that showcases the true color of the titanium frame with no color applied to its surface in the PVD process. The rear glass is a matching mid- to-light gray tone. The finish is very similar to that of the Apple Watch Ultra, which also has a titanium casing. It also harks back in some ways to the Space Gray finish of the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 6 and &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 6S.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/iphone-15-pro-max-camera.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-910485" /><br/>
It is worth noting that there is no &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; with a Gold finish. Gold was available through 2013's &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 5S to 2017's &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 8, and then on 2018's &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; XS to 2022's &zwnj;iPhone 14 Pro&zwnj;. If you were a fan of this color in previous years, you will now need to look to one of the other options. The warm gray of Natural Titanium may be the best alternative.<br/>
<br/>
<h3 id="how_to_decide_on_a_color">How to Decide on a Color</h3><br/>
If you use your &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; with a case, you may wish to consider which device color will best complement it. You may prefer neutral tones such as White Titanium or Black Titanium and use a more colorful case. Alternatively, you could choose a more striking device color like Blue Titanium and use a more neutral case for an interesting contrast.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/iphone-15-pro-finewoven-cases.jpg" alt="" width="2839" height="1177" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-910359" /><br/>
White or Black Titanium may age better over time as new devices are released since they are more neutral, almost monochrome shades that tend to have a more timeless effect. If you do not use a case at all, you may wish to take advantage of a more eye-catching color option such as Natural or Blue Titanium.<br/>
<br/>
If you want an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; in a shade that is noticeably brand new, Natural Titanium is the best option. It is most likely to indicate that you have the latest-generation device and could be the most popular color option this year since it is quite different from the offerings in recent years.<br/>
<br/>
Your choice of color may also be dependent on how often you upgrade your &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;. If you upgrade every year, you may be more confident in buying a more striking new color. If you upgrade more often, it can be a good idea to get a different color every time. A new finish can certainly add some novelty to purchasing a new &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; and make it feel more different from your previous device. Alternatively, if you tend to keep your &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; for many years and upgrade less often, it may be wiser to consider a color that is more similar to one you have enjoyed previously.<br/>
<br/>
Customers with multiple Apple devices may also want to get an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; color that complements their other devices. For example, if you have a Midnight <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/">MacBook Air</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod/">HomePod</a>, Blue Titanium is a good match. The Apple Watch Ultra will be best complimented by Natural Titanium, while Apple Watches with stainless steel casings will be best matched by White Titanium.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-15-Pro">iPhone 15 Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone-15-pro-color-options/">iPhone 15 Pro Color Options: Which Did You Choose?</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-15-pro-color-options-which-did-you-choose.2401950/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple began <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/15/iphone-15-preorders-now-available/">accepting pre-orders</a> for the new iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max today, and shipping estimates for the devices on Apple's online store are already beginning to slip into November for many configurations.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/iPhone-15-Pro-lineup.jpg" alt="" width="2880" height="1620" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-910338" /><br/>
As of 7:15 a.m. Pacific Time in the U.S., the iPhone 15 Pro Max is facing up to a 6-7 week shipping estimate for some configurations on Apple's online store, while the iPhone 15 Pro faces up to a 2-3 week delay for some models. The lower-end iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus are largely still available for launch-day delivery.<br/>
<br/>
Inventory will inevitably continue to tighten for both delivery and Apple Store pickup as the day progresses, so order quickly if you are planning to.<br/>
<br/>
As is common when iPhone pre-orders begin, some customers have encountered errors while attempting to place their orders on Apple's website or in the Apple Store app, amid the influx in demand. The issues will likely resolve as the day progresses.<br/>
<br/>
iPhone 15 Pro models have several new features, including a USB-C port, lightweight titanium frame, customizable Action button, faster A17 Pro chip manufactured with a 3nm process, up to 5x optical zoom on the Pro Max model, thinner bezels around the screen, Wi-Fi 6E support, an increased 8GB of RAM, and much more.<br/>
<br/>
The devices will launch in stores and begin arriving to customers on Friday, September 22.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-store/">Apple Store</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-15-Pro">iPhone 15 Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/15/iphone-15-pro-shipping-estimates-october/">iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max Shipping Estimates Extend Into November</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-15-pro-and-pro-max-shipping-estimates-extend-into-november.2401932/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple is now accepting pre-orders for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a>, &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; Plus, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a>, and &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; Max through <a href="https://www.apple.com/iphone/">its online storefront</a> and the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/apple-store/id375380948">Apple Store app</a>. The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-store/">Apple Store</a> app is typically the quickest way to get a pre-order in as it is often accessible before the website comes up.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/iPhone-15-and-15-Pro-Pre-Orders-Live-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-911294" /><br/>
Pre-orders are being accepted in more than 40 countries and regions around the world, and those who used Apple's "Get Ready" feature should be able to hit a button to get their orders in without hassle.<br/>
<br/>
Pricing on the &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; starts at &#36;799 or &#36;33.29 per month in the United States, while pricing on the &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; Plus starts at &#36;899 or &#36;37.45 per month. The &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; is available starting at &#36;999 or &#36;41.62 per month, and the &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; Max is available starting at &#36;1,199 or &#36;49.95 per month. Pricing will vary depending on country.<br/>
<br/>
The lowest-priced &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj;, 15 Plus, and 15 Pro models have 128GB of storage, but the &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; Max starts with 256GB of storage. Storage upgrades are available for an increased price, with up to 1TB of storage available. Apple is encouraging customers to use trade-in credits to lower the price of the new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> models, and it is also <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-iphone/carrier-offers">promoting carrier deals</a> from AT&T, Verizon, and T-Mobile in the U.S.<br/>
<br/>
All of the &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; models are equipped with USB-C ports, the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/dynamic-island/">Dynamic Island</a>, a new Ultra Wideband chip, Qualcomm 5G modems, and a range of camera updates. The more affordable &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; Plus have an A16 chip, an aluminum frame, and a frosted glass back, as well as a new 48-megapixel Main camera. There have been updates to Portrait mode, Night mode, and general improvements to image quality thanks to Smart HDR updates.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/iPhone-15-Colors.jpeg" alt="" width="1600" height="898" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-910250" /><br/>
The &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; models feature a new titanium frame that makes them much lighter than prior-generation models, with titanium also offering increased strength and durability. Apple replaced the mute switch with an Action button that can be customized with a number of functions, and display bezels have been slimmed down.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/iphone-15-blue.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-911148" /><br/>
Pro models are also equipped with a faster A17 Pro chip with major GPU improvements that enable them to play console-level games, and they feature all of the camera improvements from the &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; models, plus more.<br/>
<br/>
Both models have improved Ultra Wide cameras, and while the &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; still has a 3x Telephoto lens, the &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; Max has a new tetraprism mechanism for its Telephoto lens, enabling 5x optical zoom.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/iphone-15-blue-2.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-911150" /><br/>
It's not yet clear on whether there will be shortages of the new &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; models, but it is a good idea to pre-order right away just in case. There were rumors of production difficulties with the &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; Max, so it is possible it will sell out. The 5x zoom lens, the new titanium material, and the A17 Pro chip make it especially enticing.<br/>
<br/>

U.S. carriers like Verizon, AT&T, and T-Mobile are accepting preorders for the new devices, as are other carriers worldwide. Big box retailers like Best Buy, Target, and Walmart have pre-orders available too.<br/>
<br/>
Customers who pre-order one of the &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; models can expect to begin receiving their deliveries on Friday, September 22, the official launch date for the new devices.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-15">iPhone 15 (Buy Now)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-15-Pro">iPhone 15 Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99">iPhone</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/15/iphone-15-preorders-now-available/">iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Pro Models Now Available for Pre-Order</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-15-and-iphone-15-pro-models-now-available-for-pre-order.2401920/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple does not advertise battery capacities for its new iPhone 15 lineup, but <em><a href="https://www.mysmartprice.com/gear/apple-iphone-15-series-battery-capacity-wattage-support-revealed-by-chinese-regulatory-database/">MySmartPrice</a></em> has obtained this information from a Chinese regulatory database.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/iphone-15-lineup-store.jpg" alt="" width="2976" height="1538" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-911377" /><br/>
The Chinese regulatory listing reveals that the iPhone 15 has a 3,349mAh battery (rated capacity) and a wattage of 12.981Wh, while the iPhone 15 Pro has a 3,274mAh battery and a wattage of 12.70Wh.<br/>
<br/>
Battery capacities for the full iPhone 15 lineup:<br/>
<ul><li>iPhone 15: 3,349mAh</li><br/>
<li>iPhone 15 Plus: 4,383mAh</li><br/>
<li>iPhone 15 Pro: 3,274mAh</li><br/>
<li>iPhone 15 Pro Max: 4,422mAh</li></ul><br/>
Battery capacities for the 2022 iPhone 14 lineup:<br/>
<ul><li>iPhone 14: 3,279 mAh</li><br/>
<li>iPhone 14 Plus: 4,325 mAh</li><br/>
<li>iPhone 14 Pro: 3,200 mAh</li><br/>
<li>iPhone 14 Pro Max: 4,323 mAh</li></ul><br/>
The same database accurately revealed battery capacities for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/09/11/iphone-14-battery-capacities-mah/">all four iPhone 14 models</a> ahead of those devices launching last year. <br/>
<br/>
Despite the incremental increases shown above, Apple did not highlight any battery life improvements for its new iPhone 15 models compared to their direct predecessors, presumably because any difference is negligible in real-world usage. This comes contrary to a multitude of rumors prior to Apple's event, which suggested that the major efficiency improvements of the A17 Pro chip would bring battery life improvements.<br/>
<br/>
According to Apple, the approximate battery life of each of iPhone 15 model is as follows:<br/>
<ul><li>iPhone 15: 20 hours</li><br/>
<li>iPhone 15 Plus: 26 hours</li><br/>
<li>iPhone 15 Pro: 23 hours</li><br/>
<li>iPhone 15 Pro Max: 29 hours</li><br/>
</ul>This is exactly the same as the iPhone 14, iPhone 14 Plus, iPhone 14 Pro Max, and iPhone 14 Pro Max. Of course, it's possible that efficiency improvements may still result in slightly better real-world performance in Apple's latest models, but we won't know until third-party tests are available.<br/>
<br/>
All four iPhone 15 models were announced by Apple earlier this week and will be available to pre-order on Friday. The devices are set to launch on September 22.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-15">iPhone 15 (Buy Now)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-15-Pro">iPhone 15 Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99">iPhone</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/15/iphone-15-battery-capacities-revealed/">iPhone 15 Battery Capacities Revealed in Regulatory Database</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-15-battery-capacities-revealed-in-regulatory-database.2401911/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple said on Friday it would issue a software update for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-12/">iPhone 12</a> users in France to address <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/13/france-orders-end-to-iphone-12-sales-radiation/">radiation concerns</a> raised by the country's regulators (via <em><a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/apple-implement-iphone-12-update-next-few-days-france-minister-2023-09-15/">Reuters</a></em>).<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/04/iphone-12-preorder-purple.jpg" alt="" width="1213" height="682" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-794852" /><blockquote>"We will issue a software update for users in France to accommodate the protocol used by French regulators. We look forward to iPhone 12 continuing to be available in France," Apple said in a statement.<br/>
<br/>
"This is related to a specific testing protocol used by French regulators and not a safety concern," added the company.</blockquote>The French regulator ANFR said it would test the software update. If it made a difference to the electromagnetic waves the device emitted, the regulator said it would bring the model into compliance with European standards applied in France, and the marketing withdrawal order would be lifted.<br/>
<br/>
Earlier this week, France <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/13/france-orders-end-to-iphone-12-sales-radiation/">ordered</a> Apple to halt &zwnj;iPhone 12&zwnj; sales and "fix" existing devices to bring them into electromagnetic radiation compliance with European standards. The increase in emitted electromagnetic radiation observed over time by regulators appears to have been the result of successive software updates issued by Apple, and was not present when the &zwnj;iPhone 12&zwnj; was launched in 2020.<br/>
<br/>
The ANFR ordered Apple to "remove the ‌&zwnj;iPhone 12&zwnj;‌ from the French market from September 12 due to the model exceeding the limit" for electromagnetic absorption by the body. The agency also told Apple to recall every ‌&zwnj;iPhone 12&zwnj;‌ it has ever sold in the country. Ministers later said that though the radiation level was above the accepted standard, it was not dangerous and people were safe to continue using the phones, local media reported. <br/>
<br/>
Following the controversy, Apple <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-09-14/apple-tech-support-staff-urged-to-stay-mum-on-iphone-12-radiation-issue">reportedly</a> advised its tech-support staff not to volunteer any information when consumers ask about the issue, and tell any concerned customers that that all Apple products go through rigorous testing to ensure that they're safe, according to guidance.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-12/">iPhone 12</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/france/">France</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99">iPhone</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/15/apple-iphone-12-software-update-france-radiation/">Apple to Issue iPhone 12 Software Update in France to Address Radiation Concerns</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-to-issue-iphone-12-software-update-in-france-to-address-radiation-concerns.2401857/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>
