		<description><![CDATA[Apple is planning to produce between 60,000 and 80,000 Vision Pro units for the February 2 launch of the device, according to <a href="https://twitter.com/mingchikuo/status/1745516663867629912">analyst Ming-Chi Kuo</a>. With the small size of the shipment, Kuo believes that the Vision Pro will "sell out soon after the release."<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/Apple-Vision-Pro-with-battery-Feature-Orange.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-898552" /><br/>
According to Kuo, though Apple has not yet defined the key applications for the Vision Pro and the price is high, the "groundbreaking technology innovations" and Apple's "base of core fans and heavy users" will exhaust supplies of the device.<br/>
<br/>
Kuo made similar comments <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/09/kuo-apple-vision-pro-may-sell-out-fast/">earlier this week</a> when he said that demand for the headset would cause it to sell out during pre-orders, and he believes there will be long shipping delays after the initial launch period. Apple is expected to produce fewer than 400,000 Vision Pro headsets in 2024 due to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/07/03/apple-vision-pro-drastic-production-cuts/">complexity of manufacturing</a>.<br/>
<br/>
The first run of Vision Pro headsets might sell out quick, but Kuo says that so far, it is unclear if the demand for the Vision Pro will be sustained "after the novelty wears off." Continued sales will depend on "clear and correct" product positioning and key applications from Apple.<br/>
<br/>
Apple plans to release the Vision Pro on Friday, February 2, but pre-orders will be accepted starting on January 19 at 5:00 a.m. Pacific Time. Orders are limited to the United States for the time being, and Apple has not yet provided details on when the headset might be available in other countries.<br/>
<br/>
Customers that are planning to pick up one of the &#36;3,500 Vision Pro devices should plan to pre-order immediately in order to ensure a headset on launch day.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/">Ming-Chi Kuo</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-vision-pro.209">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/11/kuo-vision-pro-sellout-likely/">Kuo: Apple Will Only Produce Up to 80,000 Vision Pro Headsets for Launch, Sellout Likely</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/kuo-apple-will-only-produce-up-to-80-000-vision-pro-headsets-for-launch-sellout-likely.2416083/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Amazon continues to provide steep discounts on multiple AirPods models this week, with the AirPods Pro 2 with USB-C at an all-time low price and the AirPods 3 and AirPods 2 at solid second-best prices.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/05/Airpods-2-and-Pro-2-Discount-Feature-Blue.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-895348" /><em><small>Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with some of these vendors. When you click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment, which helps us keep the site running.</small></em><br/>
<br/>
The newest AirPods model, the AirPods Pro 2 with USB-C, is available for the record low price of <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0CHWRXH8B%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"><strong>&#36;189.00</strong></a> on Amazon, down from &#36;249.00. Amazon provides an estimated delivery date of January 13 through January 16 if ordered today.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0CHWRXH8B%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"target="_blank"><div class="fancybutton"><div class="fancybadge">&#36;60 OFF</div>AirPods Pro 2 with USB-C for &#36;189.00</div></a></div><br/>
<br/>
Secondly, the AirPods 3 with Lightning Charging Case have hit <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0BDHB9Y8H%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"><strong>&#36;149.99</strong></a> on Amazon, down from &#36;169.00. We've seen this one down about &#36;10 cheaper in past sales, but this remains the best deal that we've tracked since the holidays.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0BDHB9Y8H%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1"target="_blank"><div class="fancybutton"><div class="fancybadge">&#36;19 OFF</div>AirPods 3 for &#36;149.99</div></a></div><br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Microsoft today overtook Apple as the world's most valuable public company by market value. Apple's share price dropped by just one percent, enabling Microsoft to narrowly pull ahead of Apple at a value of &#36;2.87 trillion.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/12/aapl-logo-banner.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="890" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-776656" /><br/>
Microsoft has briefly overtaken Apple as the most valuable company since 2018, most recently in 2020 and 2021 when concerns about supply chain shortages dented Apple's stock price and a boom in remote working bolstered Microsoft. Over the past year, Microsoft's support for artificial intelligence tools by backing OpenAI has helped boost its value, while equivalent offerings from Apple have been noticeably absent.<br/>
<br/>
In its <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/02/apple-4q-2023-results/">November earnings report</a>, Apple's sales results missed expectations as demand for iPads and wearables was lower than expected. Mac revenue also <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/02/mac-revenue-down-m3-sales-improvements/">saw a major drop</a> compared to the previous year. It is yet to be seen how responses to the Vision Pro headset will influence the market, but expectations are relatively low due to low sales forecasts and the device's high price point.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/microsoft/">Microsoft</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/aapl/">AAPL</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/11/microsoft-overtakes-apple-as-most-valuable-company/">Microsoft Overtakes Apple as World&#039;s Most Valuable Company</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/microsoft-overtakes-apple-as-worlds-most-valuable-company.2416064/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today received approval to sell the HomePod mini in Malaysia, according to a local regulatory filing <a href="https://twitter.com/XavierNaxa/status/1745442408656179388">uncovered by Xavier Naxa</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/11/homepod-mini-thumb-feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-770560" /><br/>
It's unclear when the HomePod mini will be available in Malaysia, but sales will presumably begin on Apple's online store there within the next few months. Apple has yet to receive approval to sell the full-size second-generation HomePod in the country.<br/>
<br/>
Apple first released the HomePod mini in October 2020 in the U.S., and it is now sold in around 25 countries. <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/18/homepod-mini-new-colors/">New color options</a> were added in November 2021, and the speaker's previously-unused temperature and humidity sensor was <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/01/18/homepods-now-feature-temperature-humidity-sensor/">activated last year</a>.<br/>
<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[When Apple first unveiled its next-generation Vision Pro headset at WWDC 2023, the company shared promotional videos that briefly teased the potential applications of using the &#36;3,499 spatial computing device in conjunction with a Mac. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/vision-pro-macbook.jpg" alt="" width="3022" height="1698" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-930147" /><br/>
Despite Apple's announcement that Vision Pro will launch on February 2, Apple has yet to expand on the specifics of how the two devices work together. But sift through code and marketing materials, and there are subtle indications about what is possible - and what the limitations are likely to be. Here's what we know.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px; color: #4A90E2; margin-top: 2px;">Mac and Vision Pro: What You Can Do</span><br><br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 14px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #4A90E2; padding: 3px 6px; border-radius: 4px; margin-bottom: 2px;">Create a Virtual Desktop</span><br><br/>
When it comes to the Mac, the keystone feature of Apple Vision Pro is something called Mac Virtual Display. The system uses AirPlay 2, and allows you to connect your Mac wirelessly to the headset just by looking at your computer through your Vision Pro. According to Apple, this allows you to place and resize a virtual representation of your Mac's display anywhere in space, and "use Vision Pro as an enormous, private, portable 4K display, ideal for pro workflows." <br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 14px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #4A90E2; padding: 3px 6px; border-radius: 4px; margin-bottom: 2px;">Use visionOS Apps Alongside Your Mac</span><br><br/>
With Mac Virtual Display enabled, you will be able to able use visionOS apps right alongside your virtual Mac screen. This will allow you to, for example, work on a Final Cut Pro project on an enormous Mac display while also viewing and interacting with separate screens displaying visionOS apps like Photos, Notes, Files, and so on.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 14px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #4A90E2; padding: 3px 6px; border-radius: 4px; margin-bottom: 2px;">Mirror Vision Pro to Mac</span><br><br/>
Apple Vision Pro supports screen mirroring via AirPlay or FaceTime, according to code found in early beta releases of visionOS, the headset's unique operating system. When wearing Vision Pro, you will be able to select a Mac to mirror content to from the headset, allowing you to share your view with others and reduce any sense of isolation.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 14px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #4A90E2; padding: 3px 6px; border-radius: 4px; margin-bottom: 2px;">Connect Mac Accessories</span><br><br/>
Vision Pro includes a virtual keyboard for spatial computing sessions, but you can also wirelessly connect Mac accessories to the Vision Pro, including the Magic Keyboard and the Magic Trackpad for more traditional tactile input. Attaching Bluetooth accessories allows for a typical Mac workflow to continue to be used, just with the Mac display replaced by Vision Pro.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px; color: #4A90E2; margin-top: 2px;">Mac and Vision Pro: What You (Likely) Can't Do</span><br><br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 14px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #4A90E2; padding: 3px 6px; border-radius: 4px; margin-bottom: 2px;">Arrange Mac Apps in Virtual Space</span><br><br/>
Prior to Apple's official unveiling of Vision Pro, many Mac users envisioned an ideal multitasking scenario where it would be possible to break out Mac apps individually in a mixed reality workspace and switch attention between them at a glance. Based on the information available, however, it is not possible to view individual Mac apps in virtual windows alongside one another in Vision Pro's spatial computing environment.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 14px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #4A90E2; padding: 3px 6px; border-radius: 4px; margin-bottom: 2px;">Create Multiple Virtual Displays</span><br><br/>
Another likely limitation of the first-generation Vision Pro is that it only supports mirroring your Mac's built-in display. In other words, it won't be possible to extend your Mac's screen or recreate a multiple monitor Mac setup in the mixed reality workspace. This could be due to bandwidth limitations (Mac Virtual Display outputs in 4K). On that basis, multiple Mac displays in Vision Pro's spatial computing environment may be something supported in a future version, but don't expect such functionality out of the box.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 14px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #4A90E2; padding: 3px 6px; border-radius: 4px; margin-bottom: 2px;">Connect an Intel Mac</span><br><br/>
This should probably go without saying, but older Macs based on Intel architecture won't come along for the ride into the spatial computing future. Though Apple hasn't come out and said it officially, only Apple silicon Macs are likely to have the processing horsepower to communicate with Vision Pro, which itself relies on Apple's M2 processor to do the heavy lifting.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px; color: #4A90E2; margin-top: 2px;">Apple Vision Pro and the Future of Mac</span><br><br/>
As the above suggests, there are still some unknowns about Mac and Vision Pro interoperability. Bearing that in mind, are you optimistic about the future of Mac in the era of spatial computing? What, if anything, disappoints you about Vision Pro support for the Mac? Let us know in the comments. <br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple is working on an iOS 17.3 update, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/09/apple-releases-ios-17-3-beta-3-to-developers/">has seeded three betas</a> to developers and public beta testers so far. The update isn't quite as large as the prior iOS 17.2 update <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ios-17-3-beta-features/">in terms of new features</a> so the testing period won't be as long, and we are expecting it to launch before the end of January.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/12/iOS-17.3-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-926334" /><br/>
In terms of timing, a launch the week of January 22nd might make the most sense. We've had three betas, two of which have not added anything particularly notable, suggesting there isn't much testing left. If Apple plans to launch the update on the 22nd or the 23rd, we can expect to see the release candidate version of the iOS 17.3 update on the 15th, followed by the launch.<br/>
<br/>
Apple could also release iOS 17.3 on the week of the 29th, but that is the week that <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/visionos/">visionOS</a> and the Vision Pro headset will be coming out. Apple does sometimes tie software release updates together, but as an entirely new operating system, &zwnj;visionOS&zwnj; isn't likely to be accompanied by any other updates.<br/>
<br/>
The last new operating system update that Apple came out with was watchOS back in 2015. watchOS saw its official release on Friday, April 24, 2015, the same day that the first Apple Watch models launched.<br/>
<br/>
Apple last year <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/01/23/apple-releases-ios-16-3/">released iOS 16.3</a> on January 23, and in 2022, Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/01/26/apple-releases-ios-15-3/">released iOS 15.3</a> on January 26, so a January 22 launch date for iOS 17.3 would be in line with Apple's past release timelines.<br/>
<br/>
iOS 17.3's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ios-17-3-beta-features/">main new feature</a> is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/12/ios-17-3-stolen-device-protection-feature/">Stolen Device Protection</a>, a feature that prevents a thief that somehow gains access to both your <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> and your passcode from accessing sensitive information. It locks several features behind a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mask-face-id/">Face ID</a> scan, preventing a thief from viewing <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/icloud/">iCloud</a> Keychain passwords, turning off Lost Mode, using Safari payment methods, and more.<br/>
<br/>
It also adds a time-based delay before allowing &zwnj;Face ID&zwnj;, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/find-my-network-accessory-program/">Find My</a>, or Stolen Device Protection to be turned off, and before letting an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-id/">Apple ID</a> or &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; passcode be changed.<br/>
<br/>
Along with Stolen Device Protection, iOS 17.3 adds Collaborative <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/">Apple Music</a> Playlists, a feature originally intended for iOS 17.2. With Collaborative Playlists, multiple people can contribute to one shared &zwnj;Apple Music&zwnj; playlist.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-17/">iPadOS 17</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-17.241">iOS 17</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-17.242">iPadOS 17</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/10/when-will-ios-17-3-be-released/">When Will iOS 17.3 Be Released?</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/when-will-ios-17-3-be-released.2416033/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

Hyper has a &#36;130 Qi2 10,000mAh Power Bank coming in the second quarter of the year, with the power bank able to magnetically connect to an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; for charging on the go. It includes a 20W charging port as well, with the port providing both input and output power.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/hyperjuice-qi2-battery-pack.jpg" alt="" width="1023" height="575" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-930118" /><br/>

		<description><![CDATA[<a href="https://milacares.com/">Mila</a>, a company that makes air purifiers and humidifiers, today announced the launch of the Mila Air 3, an air purifier that offers <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/homekit/">HomeKit</a> integration.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/mila-air-3.jpg" alt="" width="2174" height="1223" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-929704" /><br/>
The Mila Air 3 is an upgrade over the first-generation Mila Air Purifier. Along with &zwnj;HomeKit&zwnj; support, the updated model includes a quieter, more energy efficient fan and more powerful performance thanks to an updated motor. An LCD display provides feedback on air quality, and capacitive buttons allow for on-device control. <br/>
<br/>
With &zwnj;HomeKit&zwnj; integration, the Mila Air 3 will work with the Home app on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>, and Mac, and it will allow the air purifier to be turned on or adjusted with <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a> voice commands.<br/>
<br/>
Mila Air Purifiers work with a new Mila Insights app, providing details on air quality alerts, air quality over time both indoors and outdoors, and the filtering performance of the Mila.<br/>
<br/>
The Mila Air 3 is set to launch in the summer of 2024. Depending on the filter selection, pricing will be &#36;408 to &#36;448, though it will drop to &#36;349 for users who subscribe to an auto-refill service for filters.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ces-2024/">CES 2024</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/10/ces-2024-mila-air-purifier/">CES 2024: Mila Debuts HomeKit-Compatible Smart Air Purifier</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ces-2024-mila-debuts-homekit-compatible-smart-air-purifier.2416024/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today <a href="https://developer.apple.com/safari/download/">released a new update</a> for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/safari-technology-preview/">Safari Technology Preview</a>, the experimental browser Apple <a href="http://www.macrumors.com/2016/03/30/apple-safari-technology-preview-browser/">first introduced</a> in March 2016. Apple designed the &zwnj;Safari Technology Preview&zwnj; to test features that may be introduced into future release versions of Safari.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-785724" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/02/Safari-Technology-Preview-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2368" height="1332" /><br/>
&zwnj;Safari Technology Preview&zwnj; 186 includes fixes and updates for CSS, Forms, HTML, JavaScript, Rendering, Service Workers, Web Animations, and Web API.<br/>
<br/>
The current &zwnj;Safari Technology Preview&zwnj; release is compatible with machines running macOS Ventura and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sonoma/">macOS Sonoma</a>, the latest version of macOS that Apple released in September 2023.<br/>
<br/>
The &zwnj;Safari Technology Preview&zwnj; update is available through the Software Update mechanism in System Preferences or System Settings to anyone who has <a href="https://developer.apple.com/safari/download/">downloaded the browser</a>. Full release notes for the update are available <a href="https://developer.apple.com/safari/technology-preview/release-notes/">on the Safari Technology Preview website</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Apple's aim with &zwnj;Safari Technology Preview&zwnj; is to gather feedback from developers and users on its browser development process. &zwnj;Safari Technology Preview&zwnj; can run side-by-side with the existing Safari browser and while designed for developers, it does not require a developer account to download.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[The U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) today formally opposed Apple's motion for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/21/apple-watch-removed-from-online-store/">Apple Watch sales ban</a> to remain paused for the duration of Apple's appeal.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/09/apple-watch-series-6-blood-oxygen-monitoring-1.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="897" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-759072" /><br/>
In a document filed with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, ITC lawyers said "Apple presents a weak and unconvincing case to invoke the extraordinary remedy of a stay pending appeal," adding that Apple's arguments "amount to little more than an indisputably adjudicated infringer requesting permission to continue infringing the asserted patents."<br/>
<br/>
The court is accepting responses from other parties in support of the ITC's ruling until January 15, so the Apple Watch should remain available until early next week at a minimum.<br/>
<br/>
In October, the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/27/us-trade-tribunal-apple-watch-ban-masimo/">ITC ruled</a> that Apple Watch models with blood oxygen sensing infringed on patents owned by medical technology company Masimo, and ordered that the import and sale of these devices be banned in the U.S. as a result. The feature is available on the Apple Watch Series 6 and newer, excluding Apple Watch SE models.<br/>
<br/>
Masimo has accused Apple of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/18/apple-masimo-legal-battle/">stealing trade secrets and poaching employees</a> to develop its blood oxygen sensing functionality. Last month, Masimo said it was <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/19/masimo-ceo-on-apple-watch-ban/">open to settlement talks</a>, but Apple had reportedly not expressed any interest at the time.<br/>
<br/>
In December, Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/21/apple-watch-removed-from-online-store/">briefly paused sales</a> of the Apple Watch Series 9 and Apple Watch Ultra 2 across its U.S. retail stores and online store. After appealing the ITC's ruling with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, Apple was <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/27/apple-watch-series-9-and-ultra-2-sales-ban-paused/">granted a temporary stay</a>, leading to the ban being paused and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/28/apple-watch-series-9-ultra-2-online/">sales resuming</a> for now.<br/>
<br/>
Apple is reportedly <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/18/apple-watch-import-ban-software-fix/">working on software changes</a> to address the alleged patent infringement, and the U.S. Customs and Border Protection agency is expected to rule on these changes later this week. However, Masimo believes that the Apple Watch's hardware design will have to change to become compliant, and the ITC also expressed skepticism.<br/>
<br/>
"To the extent Apple relies on the soon-expected ruling from Customs and Border Protection ("CBP") as to whether certain redesigned Apple Watches infringe the Asserted Patents, those arguments are, at best, misplaced," ITC lawyers said in today's filing. "A favorable ruling to Apple has no bearing on Apple's alleged likelihood of success on the merits as to any raised issue, and instead would undermine Apple's 'irreparable harm' argument."<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Sennheiser <a href="https://newsroom.sennheiser.com/sennheiser-triples-down-at-ces-24">this week announced</a> the launch of several new wire-free earbud and headphone options that are designed to compete with the AirPods and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/">AirPods Pro</a> from Apple.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/sennheiser-sport-earbuds.jpg" alt="" width="1701" height="957" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-929907" /><br/>
The Momentum Sport earbuds are fitness optimized, featuring both a heart rate sensor and a body temperature sensor that can provide real-time biometric feedback. The heart rate data can be added to the Health app on an Apple device, and the earbuds also integrate with other platforms like Strava, Garmin, Peloton, and Polar.<br/>
<br/>
There is a built-in acoustic relief channel that is meant to minimize footstep noise, breathing, and other sounds from the body, and there is a semi-open design that promotes natural environmental awareness that's important for running, biking, and similar activities.<br/>
<br/>
Several listening modes are available, including a Transparency mode, an anti-wind mode, and an Adaptive Noise Canceling mode, so users can adapt the earbuds to multiple activities. The earbuds include a new acoustic system for what Sennheiser says is the best sound yet in a sport earbud, and there is IP55 sweat and water resistance along with a shock-proof chassis. Priced at &#36;330, the Momentum Sport will be available starting on April 9.<br/>
<br/>
The mid-range Accentum Plus headphones are an affordable option that supports aptX and offers 50 hours of listening time on a single charge. The headphones include Adaptive ANC to cut down on ambient sound, and an audio cable allows them to be used in situations where wire-free functionality is not available, such as on an airplane. The Accentum Plus will launch on February 20 and will be priced at &#36;230 in the U.S.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/sennheiser-headphones.jpg" alt="" width="1307" height="735" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-930049" /><br/>
Sennheiser's Momentum True Wireless 4 earbuds are built on Qualcomm's S5 Sound Gen 2 platform with aptX lossless sound quality and low latency. Bluetooth 5.4 is included, as is Auracast, which Sennheiser says offers "exceptional signal continuity while on the go."<br/>
<br/>

Adaptive ANC has been improved, plus there is a more advanced tuning system and an upgraded battery system allowing the earbuds to last for up to 7.5 hours before needing to be recharged. The Momentum True Wireless 4 earbuds will be available for pre-order on February 15, and they will be priced at &#36;300 in the United States.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/sennheiser/">Sennheiser</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ces-2024/">CES 2024</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/10/ces-2024-sennheiser/">CES 2024: Sennheiser&#039;s New Wireless Earbuds Feature Heart Rate and Body Temperature Sensors</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ces-2024-sennheisers-new-wireless-earbuds-feature-heart-rate-and-body-temperature-sensors.2416018/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple accessory company <a href="https://www.nativeunion.com">Native Union</a> this week unveiled a number of upcoming accessories that are set to launch throughout the year.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/native-union-2-in-1.png" alt="" width="1211" height="681" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-930109" /><br/>
The Voyage 2-in-1 is a Qi2 wireless charger that supports the latest wireless charging standard. It is able to charge an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> at up to 15W, the same as <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe-battery-pack/">MagSafe</a>. The foldable charger has a main charging base for the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; and a second charging base with an Apple Watch charging puck that can fast charge the Apple Watch or charge up the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/">AirPods Pro</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Native Union's (Re)Classic Power Bank features a 5,000mAh battery to add additional power to an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;. The ultra slim power bank is able to connect magnetically to an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; that supports &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; for charging on the go.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/native-union-power-bank.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-930110" /><br/>
The Desk Mat and Desk Laptop Stand are new desktop accessories designed to be used with a Mac. The Mat has a textured surface and is made from an animal-free material, while the Desk Laptop Stand has a premium metal construction that elevates a laptop or tablet up to 60cm.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/native-union-laptop-stand.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-930111" /><br/>
The Slim Charger is a thin, 67W USB-C power adapter with two ports, and it is covered with a soft-touch canvas material. The slim design allows it to fit behind a desk, a couch, or in other tight spots. The Pocket Cable, inspired by the Swiss Army Knife, features a fold-up USB-C cable that charges devices up to 60W.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="https://www.nativeunion.com">Native Union's</a> Desk Mat, Desk Laptop Stand, and (Re)Classic Power Bank will be coming out in the first quarter of the year, with launch dates coming in the future for the Voyage 2-in-1 Magnetic Wireless Charger, Slim Charger, and Pocket Cable.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/native-union/">Native Union</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ces-2024/">CES 2024</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/10/ces-2024-native-union/">CES 2024: Native Union Debuts 2-in-1 Qi2 Charger, Laptop Stand, Magnetic Power Bank and More</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ces-2024-native-union-debuts-2-in-1-qi2-charger-laptop-stand-magnetic-power-bank-and-more.2416015/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple currently offers two external displays, including the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/studio-display/">Studio Display</a> and the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/displays/">Pro Display XDR</a>. It also sells the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/">24-inch iMac</a> for customers who prefer an all-in-one desktop computer, but the larger 27-inch iMac was discontinued in March 2022.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/hero-banner-displays.jpg" alt="" width="1723" height="969" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-930094" /><br/>
Below, we recap rumors about next-generation Studio Display and Pro Display XDR models, as well as a potential 32-inch iMac.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Studio Display</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/hero-banner-displays-studio-display.jpg" alt="" width="1723" height="969" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-930099" /><br/>
Apple released the Studio Display in March 2022 alongside the first Mac Studio. The monitor features a 27-inch LCD screen with 5K resolution, a 60Hz refresh rate, P3 wide color, up to 600 nits brightness, a built-in camera and speakers, one Thunderbolt 3 port, and three USB-C ports. In the U.S., the Studio Display starts at &#36;1,599.<br/>
<br/>
There haven't been any specific rumors about a new Studio Display. However, in December 2022, <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman said Apple was <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/12/18/updated-pro-display-xdr-gurman/">working on multiple new external monitors</a>. He said at least one of these monitors <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/07/03/gurman-apple-monitor-smart-home-display/">could function as a smart home hub</a> in a low-power state, but it's unclear which model he was referring to. In July 2023, Gurman said Apple's next-generation monitors would launch in 2024 at the very earliest.<br/>
<br/>
There have been <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/10/apple-27-inch-mini-led-display-cancelled/">on-again, off-again rumors</a> about Apple planning a new 27-inch external display with mini-LED backlighting and ProMotion support, which could allow for up to a 120Hz refresh rate, but the status of this project is not entirely clear. In April 2023, Apple supply chain analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said the display was <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/11/kuo-apple-27-inch-mini-led-display-still-planned/">slated for mass production in 2024 or early 2025</a>. It's unclear if this monitor would be the next Studio Display.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Pro Display XDR</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/Pro-Display-XDR-Gray.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="840" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-930101" /><br/>
Released in December 2019 alongside an updated Mac Pro, the high-end Pro Display XDR features a 32-inch screen with LED backlighting, a 6K resolution, a 60Hz refresh rate, P3 wide color, up to 1,600 nits of brightness, one Thunderbolt 3 port, and three USB-C ports. In the U.S., the monitor starts at &#36;4,999, but the optional Pro Stand costs &#36;999 extra.<br/>
<br/>
Gurman said one of the new external monitors that Apple was working on was an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/12/18/updated-pro-display-xdr-gurman/">updated version of the Pro Display XDR</a> with an Apple silicon chip, something the current model lacks. In the Studio Display, an A13 Bionic chip powers features such as Center Stage camera framing, spatial audio, and Siri voice commands.<br/>
<br/>
While no other features have been rumored yet, some additions that customers are hoping for include a webcam, speakers, and a higher refresh rate.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>32-Inch iMac</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/iMac-24-Apple-Newsroom-Gray-bg.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-930105" /><br/>
In October 2023, both Gurman and Apple supply chain analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said Apple was <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/23/new-32-inch-imac-pro-expected-2024-or-2025/">developing a 32-inch iMac</a> for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/17/32-inch-imac-coming-in-2025/">release in late 2024 or in 2025</a>. Kuo said the larger iMac's screen would feature mini-LED backlighting.<br/>
<br/>
In November 2023, Apple announced that it has <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/06/no-27-inch-with-apple-silicon/">no plans to release a 27-inch iMac with an Apple silicon chip</a>. For customers who want a large-screened desktop setup, Apple recommended pairing the Studio Display with a Mac Studio or Mac mini. Apple did not explicitly rule out the possibility of a 32-inch iMac being released in the future.<br/>
<br/>
Apple updated the 24-inch iMac <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/30/apple-announces-imac-with-m3-chip/">with its latest M3 chip</a> last year.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/displays/">Apple Pro Display XDR</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/studio-display/">Apple Studio Display</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/mac-accessories.77">Mac Accessories</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/10/studio-display-pro-display-xdr-rumors/">What to Expect From Apple&#039;s Next Studio Display and Pro Display XDR</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/what-to-expect-from-apples-next-studio-display-and-pro-display-xdr.2416008/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Scosche at CES <a href="https://www.scosche.com/ces-2024">is showing off</a> a new version of its BaseLynx 2.0 Modular Charging System, with the updated model offering support for the new Qi2 wireless charging standard.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/scoche-baselynx-qi2.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="562" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-929904" /><br/>
A <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe-battery-pack/">MagSafe</a> version of the BaseLynx 2.0 <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/01/04/scosche-baselynx-charging-system/">launched in Apple retail stores</a> earlier this year, but the new model will be available directly from Scosche as of this spring.<br/>
<br/>
The BaseLynx is a multi-component charging system with modules that include a 2-in-1 Qi2 charger that works with the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> and AirPods, an Apple Watch Stand with fast charging support, a multi-device vertical charging station that provides 60W for up to three devices, and an end cap with an AC outlet and 67W USB-C port. The Qi2 wireless charging base is able to charge an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; at up to 15W, the same as &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
With all of the BaseLynx components, the setup can charge an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;, AirPods, Apple Watch, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>, MacBook, and more all at one time in one organized spot on a desktop.<br/>
<br/>
Alongside the BaseLynx 2.0, <a href="https://www.scosche.com/ces-2024">Scosche also introduced</a> the PowerVolt 150W USB-C Desk Charger With 4 USB-C ports, the PowerVolt 30W USB-C Home Charger, and the PowerVolt 40W USB-C Car Adapter able to provide 20W per USB-C port.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today seeded the third public beta of an upcoming <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sonoma/">macOS Sonoma</a> 14.3 update, allowing non-developers to test out the software ahead of its release. The third public beta comes a week after <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/04/apple-releases-macos-sonoma-14-3-public-beta-2/">the second public beta</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-900182" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/macos-sonoma-4.jpg" alt="" width="2336" height="1314" /><br/>
Beta testers can opt-in through the Software Update section of the System Settings app. Under Beta updates, simply toggle on the Sonoma Public Beta. Note that you must sign up to participate on Apple's <a href="https://beta.apple.com">beta testing website</a>.<br/>
<br/>
&zwnj;macOS Sonoma&zwnj; 14.3 includes support for collaborative playlists in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/">Apple Music</a>, allowing &zwnj;Apple Music&zwnj; subscribers to build playlists with others. When creating a new playlist or selecting an existing playlist, there's a person-shaped icon that can be clicked to turn on collaboration.<br/>
<br/>
Enabling collaboration provides a link that can be shared with others, and anyone with the link is able to contribute to the playlist and listen to the songs. The person who started the playlist can choose to approve those who want to join or open it up to everyone. Anyone with the link to a playlist can add music, though the owner can turn off collaboration at any time or remove people.<br/>
<br/>
&zwnj;macOS Sonoma&zwnj; 14.3 is expected to see a launch later in January.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sonoma/">macOS Sonoma</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macos-sonoma.243">macOS Sonoma</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/10/apple-seeds-macos-sonoma-14-3-public-beta-3/">Apple Seeds Third Public Beta of macOS Sonoma 14.3</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-seeds-third-public-beta-of-macos-sonoma-14-3.2415992/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today seeded the third betas of upcoming iOS 17.3 and iPadOS 17.3 updates to public beta testers, allowing non-developers to test the software ahead of its release. The second public iOS 17.3 and iPadOS 17.3 betas come almost a month after Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/14/apple-seeds-ios-17-3-public-beta-1/">released the first betas</a>. Note that while Apple is calling these the third betas of iOS 17.3 and iPadOS 17.3, there was technically never a second public beta. Apple had to pull the second developer betas of iOS 17.3 and iPadOS 17.3, and opted to go straight to the third beta rather than releasing an updated public beta version.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-926334" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/12/iOS-17.3-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" /><br/>
Public beta testers can get the beta by opening up the Settings app, going to the Software Update section, tapping on the "Beta Updates" option, and toggling on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a> or <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-17/">iPadOS 17</a> Public Beta. Signing up on Apple's beta testing website is required.<br/>
<br/>
iOS 17.3 <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/12/ios-17-3-stolen-device-protection-feature/">includes Stolen Device Protection</a>, a feature that offers an extra layer of security in case your <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> is stolen and the thief also obtains your passcode. With this turned on, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mask-face-id/">Face ID</a> or <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/touch-id/">Touch ID</a> authentication is required for viewing <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/icloud/">iCloud</a> Keychain passwords, turning off Lost Mode, erasing an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;'s contents, using saved payment methods in Safari, and more. There is no passcode entry option should &zwnj;Face ID&zwnj; or &zwnj;Touch ID&zwnj; fail.<br/>
<br/>
Certain actions, such as changing an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-id/">Apple ID</a> password, updating a device passcode, turning off <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/find-my-network-accessory-program/">Find My</a>, and removing &zwnj;Face ID&zwnj; require authentication and also a one-hour security delay.<br/>
<br/>
The update also adds <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/12/ios-17-3-beta-apple-music-collaborative-playlists/">collaborative Apple Music playlists</a>, a feature that lets <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/">Apple Music</a> subscribers build playlists with friends, family members, and others who share their musical tastes. Any playlist can be turned into a collaborative playlist by tapping on the person-shaped icon and sharing the link.<br/>
<br/>
Those who want to try it out in iOS 17.3 can click on <a href="https://music.apple.com/us/playlist/pl.u-kaJH7JG97e?a=join&amp;it=zr6IZVEGZ6tVoblq">the MacRumors playlist link</a> to try adding a song.<br/>
<br/>
We are expecting iOS 17.3 and iPadOS 17.3 to be released sometime in January.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/10/apple-seeds-ios-17-3-public-beta-3/">Apple Seeds Third Public Beta of iOS 17.3 With Stolen Device Protection</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-seeds-third-public-beta-of-ios-17-3-with-stolen-device-protection.2415990/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Images purporting to reveal the original version of Apple's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe-battery-pack/">MagSafe</a> charger today surfaced online, providing a look at how the company conceived of the accessory over two and a half years before its release.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/magsafe-charger-original-prototype.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-929921" /><br/>
The images, shared by the Apple leaker and prototype collector known as "<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/kosutami/">Kosutami</a>," claim to show the original version of the &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; charger that Apple considered launching. The prototype has a production date of March 2017, a key period in the development of Apple's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airpower/">AirPower</a> wireless charging mat. This version of &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; was apparently developed directly alongside &zwnj;AirPower&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
The earlier version of &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> features a rubberized outer shell that feels similar to the base of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod/">HomePod</a>, rounded edges, a different array of magnets with opposite magnetism, and a large Apple logo. It is apparently the same approximate size as the final version, but noticeably thinner. The design language distinctively harks back to an earlier period in Apple's history that more generously used white rubberized plastics and featured its logo more prominently.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Unreleased prototype of MagSafe Charger. It’s super rare yet interesting. Featured different design, magnetic placement, and materials used.<br>Produced around Mar. 2017, which same the AirPower does. Project started over after its cancellation.<br>Infos in last pic. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/appleinternal?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#appleinternal</a> <a href="https://t.co/lxTQqhgk5s">pic.twitter.com/lxTQqhgk5s</a></p>&mdash; Kosutami (@KosutamiSan) <a href="https://twitter.com/KosutamiSan/status/1745026866992624041?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 10, 2024</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div><br/>
<br/>
Following the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2019/03/29/apple-officially-cancels-airpower/">cancelation of AirPower</a> in March 2019, Apple apparently revisited this earlier &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; concept and rebooted the project. It ultimately launched with the design we know today alongside the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 12 in October 2020, seeming to taking direct inspiration from the Apple Watch's charger with a thicker silver aluminum outer shell, flat sides, and no Apple logo.<br/>
<br/>

Kosutami previously shared images of various Apple charger prototypes, including a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/19/prototype-shows-why-apple-abandoned-airpower/">functional AirPower charging mat</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/30/apple-planned-magsafe-charger-color-options/">different color options</a> tested for the &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; charger, and an unreleased <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/14/collectors-discover-unreleased-apple-accessory/">"Magic Charger" accessory</a>. <div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe/">MagSafe</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/prototypes/">Prototypes</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/kosutami/">Kosutami</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/10/magsafe-charger-prototype-reveals-abandoned-design/">MagSafe Charger Prototype Reveals Abandoned 2010s Design</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/magsafe-charger-prototype-reveals-abandoned-2010s-design.2415974/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Google Maps continues to work on integrating Live Activities support for iPhones, according to new assets unearthed by <em>MacRumors</em> contributor Aaron Perris in the latest version of the app.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/02/iphone-14-pro-max-deep-purple-feature-purple.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-886218" /><br/>
Evidence that the feature was in development first appeared in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/28/google-maps-preparing-live-activities/">August</a>, but further work on it had appeared to have come to a standstill until now, suggesting it could become functional soon. <br/>
<br/>
The Google Maps team announced in February 2023 that it would roll out Live Activities support "in the coming months," so support is now long overdue based on the company's own internal roadmap.<br/>
<br/>
When support rolls out, Google Maps users will be able to view turn-by-turn directions and their ETA in a single live-updating <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> Lock Screen notification, as well as in the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/dynamic-island/">Dynamic Island</a> on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-14/">iPhone 14</a> Pro and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a> series models.<br/>
<br/>
Apple opened up its Live Activities API to third-party &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; apps with the release of iOS 16.1, and many developers have <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/live-activities/">since made good use of the feature</a>. <div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/google-maps/">Google Maps</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/live-activities/">Live Activities</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/10/google-maps-live-activities-support-continues/">Google Maps Still Working On Long-Overdue Live Activities Support</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/google-maps-still-working-on-long-overdue-live-activities-support.2415972/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>
