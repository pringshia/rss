		<description><![CDATA[<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/epic-games/">Epic Games</a> has won its antitrust lawsuit against Google, after the nine-member jury in the case unanimously agreed that the tech giant abused its power by operating an app store monopoly and charging developers unduly high fees.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2018/06/fortnite-mobile-100-million-hero.jpg" alt="" width="1450" height="850" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-642461" /><br/>
The unanimous verdict came after three hours of deliberation following a four-week trial looking into Google's Play store. Among Epic's allegations were that Google illegally tied together its Play store and Play Billing payment services, leaving developers having to use both for their apps to be included in the store.<br/>
<br/>
Google collects a commission ranging from 15% to 30% on transactions completed within apps, similar to how Apple takes its <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a> fees.<br/>
<br/>
The jury also agreed that Google's distribution agreement with developers was anticompetitive, and that Epic had been unfairly stifled by the company's behavior by forcing its own billing system on developers. The trial was brought by Epic against Google in 2020 for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2020/08/13/google-pulls-fortnight/">removing Fortnite</a> from the Google Play Store, after Epic allowed players to bypass Google's in-app purchase system.<br/>
<br/>
The reasoning in the jury case was not revealed, but in a <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/site/en-US/news/epic-v-google-trial-verdict-a-win-for-all-developers">statement on its website</a>, &zwnj;Epic Games&zwnj; CEO Tim Sweeney said the verdict "proves that Google's app store practices are illegal and they abuse their monopoly to extract exorbitant fees, stifle competition and reduce innovation."<br/>
<br/>
Sweeney added that the jury had seen "evidence that Google was willing to pay billions of dollars to stifle alternative app stores by paying developers to abandon their own store efforts and direct distribution plans, and offering highly lucrative agreements with device manufacturers in exchange for excluding competing app stores."<br/>
<br/>
Google said it would appeal. "We will continue to defend the Android business model and remain deeply committed to our users, partners and the broader Android ecosystem," said Wilson White, vice-president of government affairs and public policy at Google.<br/>
<br/>
The ruling could have profound implications for digital app store regulation, particularly within Apple's &zwnj;App Store&zwnj;. Apple won a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/epic-games-vs-apple/">similar case against Epic in 2021</a>. Rather than a jury made up of consumers though, that ruling was made by a single judge. <br/>
<br/>
Epic has asked the U.S. Supreme Court to revive key claims in the Apple case, and Apple is <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/28/apple-epic-appeal-supreme-court/">fighting</a> part of a ruling for Epic regarding Apple's "anti-steering" rule that bars developers of many iOS apps from directing users to methods of purchase available outside of the ‌&zwnj;App Store&zwnj;‌, circumventing Apple's revenue cut.<br/>
<br/>
The Supreme Court will decide in the coming months whether it will hear either or both of Epic's and Apple's appeals, but if it does not take up either petition, the previous rulings will stand. <div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/epic-games/">Epic Games</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/epic-games-vs-apple/">Epic Games vs. Apple</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/12/epic-wins-antitrust-trial-against-google/">Epic Games Wins Antitrust Lawsuit Against Google Play Store</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/epic-games-wins-antitrust-lawsuit-against-google-play-store.2413470/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[If you have an iPhone 15 or iPhone 15 Pro Max, iOS 17.2 allows you to record spatial video for viewing in the Photos app on Apple's forthcoming Vision Pro headset. Here's how you can do it.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/spatial-video-apple-visioin-pro.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="898" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-911687" /><br/>
Apple's Vision Pro headset is expected to be released around March 2024. Until then, one way you can prepare for it is to use your iPhone to record videos in a special format called spatial video that is made to be viewed on Apple's headset.<br/>
<br/>
When viewed on iPhone, spatial video appear as normal videos, but they provide an immersive viewing experience on Vision Pro that is almost three-dimensional. Combined with advanced computational videography techniques and HEVC compression, spatial memories are saved in a relatively compact file size, recorded at 30 frames per second at 1080p, and taking up to 130MB of storage space for one minute of video. <br/>
<br/>
<h2>Enabling Spatial Video</h2><br/>
<ol><li>Open the Settings app on your iPhone 15 Pro or iPhone 15 Pro Max.</li><br/>
<li>Select Camera ➝ Formats.</li><br/>
<li>Scroll down to "Video Capture" and toggle on the switch next to Spatial Video for Apple Vision Pro.</li></ol><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/12/enable-spatial-video.jpg" alt="settings" width="4137" height="2716" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-925920" /><br/>
<br/>
<h2>Recording Spatial Video</h2><br/>
Apple says that spatial video is best recorded when your iPhone is stable and in landscape orientation. In the Camera app, switch to Video recording and then look for the Vision Pro headset icon in the viewfinder. Tap the icon to switch to spatial video mode. When you are ready to record, simply hit the red record button. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/12/record-spatial-video-iphone-e1702301418431.jpg" alt="camera" width="2716" height="1339" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-925921" /><br/>
Remember that a spatial video will look like a normal video if you watch it in the Photos app on your iPhone. But there is nothing to stop you from recording special moments in spatial video so that you can experience them on Apple Vision Pro when the headset is released in early 2024.<br/>
<br/>
You can find all of the spatial videos you capture within a new Spatial album in the Photos app, and all of your spatial videos will sync across their devices with iCloud.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/record-spatial-video-iphone/">iOS 17.2: How to Record Spatial Video on iPhone 15 Pro</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-17-2-how-to-record-spatial-video-on-iphone-15-pro.2413461/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today released iOS 17.2, a major update that adds the new Journal app, a Translate option for the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a> Action Button, a Favorites playlist for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/">Apple Music</a>, and much more.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RxMh7pKD97w" title="iOS 17.2 Available Now: Here&#39;s What&#39;s New!" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe><em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/macrumors?sub_confirmation=1">Subscribe to the MacRumors YouTube channel</a> for more videos.</em></div><br/>
In this guide, we've rounded up all of the new features in the iOS 17.2 update.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="journal_app">Journal App</h2><br/>
iOS 17.2 introduces the Journal app that Apple announced as part of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a>. With the Journal app, users can record their daily activities and thoughts, with Apple providing optional prompts that can be used as inspiration.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-918878" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/Journal-App-iOS-17-Feature-Green.jpg" alt="" width="2612" height="1469" /><br/>
Journal entries can be added by tapping on the "+" button in the Journal app, and from there, users can choose a suggestion as the basis for their writing or just opt for "New Entry" to write anything at all.<br/>
<br/>
Entries are automatically tagged with a date for organizational purposes, but there are options for bookmarking, too. Journal entries can include images, voice recordings, and location tags.<br/>
<h2 id="messages_app_sticker_reactions">Messages App Sticker Reactions</h2><br/>
You can long press on any chat bubble in the Messages app to add a sticker response that serves as an alternative to a tapback reaction. Tapping on "Add Sticker" lets you choose either a sticker or an emoji to apply to the corner of an iMessage.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-918892" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/ios-17-2-tapback-reply-sticker.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" /><br/>
There was already an option to drag a sticker or an emoji onto any message bubble, but this is a much quicker method of quickly responding to an incoming message with a quick graphic that is more expressive than a tapback reaction.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="spatial_video_recording">Spatial Video Recording</h2><br/>
With iOS 17.2, the &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; Max are able to record spatial video that will be viewable in the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/photos/">Photos</a> app on the Vision Pro headset that's coming out next year.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-911687" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/spatial-video-apple-visioin-pro.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="898" /><br/>
Spatial video recording can be enabled by going to the Settings app, tapping into the Camera section, selecting Formats, and toggling on "Spatial Video for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a>." Apple says that for best results when recording spatial video, the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> should be held stable in landscape orientation while capturing video. Video is recorded at 30 frames per second at 1080p, and one minute of video takes up 130MB of storage space.<br/>
<br/>
When spatial videos captured with an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; are viewed on the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;, they appear as normal videos. Viewing the video in 3D requires the Vision Pro headset.<br/>
<h2 id="improved_telephoto_focusing_speed">Improved Telephoto Focusing Speed</h2><br/>
On the &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; and Pro Max, the Telephoto camera now focuses faster when capturing small, faraway objects.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="favorites_apple_music_playlist">Favorites Apple Music Playlist</h2><br/>
Songs that you have favorited in the &zwnj;Apple Music&zwnj; app are now automatically aggregated into a Favorites playlist.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-918891" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/apple-music-favorite-playlists.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" /><br/>
<h2 id="apple_music_favorite_songs">Apple Music Favorite Songs</h2><br/>
In the Music section of the Settings app, there is an option to add songs to your Music Library when they are favorited. The feature is toggled on by default, but it can be turned off if desired.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-922545" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/ios-17-2-music-add-favorite-songs.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" /><br/>
The option to "Favorite" songs was first added in iOS 17.1.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="apple_music_listening_history_focus_filter">Apple Music Listening History Focus Filter</h2><br/>
Apple added a Focus Filter for the &zwnj;Apple Music&zwnj; Listening History feature, so if you want to let someone else use your device to listen to music, you can activate this to turn off the Listening History so their song choices won't affect your recommendations.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-918906" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/ios-17-2-focus-filters.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" /><br/>
<h2 id="action_button_translate">Action Button Translate</h2><br/>
&zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; Max users can now <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/26/ios-17-2-translate-action-button/">choose a new Translate option</a> for the Action button.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-918874" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/ios-17-translate.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" /><br/>
When the Action button is set as Translate, pressing to hold causes the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; to pop up a Translate window that listens for spoken text. It is able to translate from one set language to another, using the languages that you have previously set up in the Translate app.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="keyboard">Keyboard</h2><br/>
Apple added an option to disable inline predictions when typing. It can be accessed by opening up the Settings app, choosing General, going to Keyboard, and scrolling down to the "Show Predictions Inline" option.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-922546" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/keyboard-inline-predictions.jpg" alt="" width="1808" height="1017" /><br/>
<br/>
There are also new keyboard layouts for eight Sámi languages.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="imessage_contact_key_verification">iMessage Contact Key Verification</h2><br/>
First previewed in December 2022, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/26/ios-17-2-imessage-contact-key-verification/">iMessage Contact Key Verification</a> is a feature designed for those who face "extraordinary digital threats," such as journalists, human rights activists, and government officials.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-876653" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/12/Apple-advanced-security-iMessage-Contact-Key-Verification_screen-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" /><br/>
Users can ensure that there is no "man in the middle" snooping on iMessage conversations, and there is an option to display a Contact Verification Code so that iMessage users can verify that they're speaking to the correct individual during in-person meetings or on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/facetime/">FaceTime</a> calls.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="messages_in_icloud_syncing">Messages in iCloud Syncing</h2><br/>
The "Messages" section in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/icloud/">iCloud</a> in the Settings app has been renamed to "Messages in &zwnj;iCloud&zwnj;." It shows the total amount of storage that messages are taking up, the number of messages synced to &zwnj;iCloud&zwnj;, and the time of the last sync. There's also a "Sync Now" option to force an update.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-918896" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/ios-17-2-messages-in-icloud.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" /><br/>
Apple previously said that additional settings would be synced through Messages in &zwnj;iCloud&zwnj; in &zwnj;iOS 17&zwnj;, like Text Message Forwarding, Send &amp; Receive accounts, and SMS filters across devices, so this may see those additional settings syncing.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="messages_catch-up">Messages Catch-Up</h2><br/>
If you have a Messages thread that has a lot of activity, you can use the new catch-up arrow to jump to the first unread message in a conversation. It shows up as an arrow in the top right corner of the display.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="apple_tv_app">Apple TV App</h2><br/>
Apple has <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/26/apple-tv-app-redesign-tvos-17-2/">removed the separate tabs</a> for Movies and TV shows in the Store section of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a> app on the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; and the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-918905" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/ios-17-2-tv-app.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" /><br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="itunes_app">iTunes App</h2><br/>
Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/11/ios-17-2-itunes-store-tv-movie-removed/">eliminated the option</a> to purchase and access TV shows and movies through the iTunes Store app, and is directing users to the &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj; app instead. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/12/ios-17-2-itunes-app.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-926061" /><br/>
<h2 id="phone_and_facetime">Phone and FaceTime</h2><br/>
In the Phone and &zwnj;FaceTime&zwnj; settings, there's a Share Name and Photo option that uses the Contact Poster. Name and Photo Sharing can be toggled off, set to Contacts Only, or set to Always Ask, which prompts you before sharing that information with others.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-922547" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/phone-share-photo.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" /><br/>
This setting was previously available for the Messages app.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="facetime">FaceTime</h2><br/>
If you join a &zwnj;FaceTime&zwnj; call that includes a contact you have blocked, you will now get a warning. Apple provides warnings when joining a call with a blocked contact, or when a blocked contact is joining a call you're already on.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="emergency_alerts_local_awareness">Emergency Alerts Local Awareness</h2><br/>
Under Notifications &amp; Emergency Alerts in the Settings app, there is a new "Local Awareness" option that can be turned on. Apple says that Local Awareness uses your approximate location to improve the timeliness, accuracy, and reliability of emergency alerts.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-918902" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/ios-17-2-emergency-local-awareness.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" /><br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="new_weather_app_features">New Weather App Features</h2><br/>
Precipitation amounts are shown for the next 10 days to provide more insight into upcoming rain and snow conditions, and there is a wind map snapshot that shows wind patterns and animations for the next 24 hours.<br/>
<br/>
An interactive moon calendar provides a visualization of the phase of the moon on any day for the next month.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="weather_widgets">Weather Widgets</h2><br/>
There are new Details, Daily Forecast, and Sunrise/Sunset widgets for the Weather app. Details shows information like precipitation chance, UV index, wind speed, and air quality, while Daily Forecast offers the weather for the next few days in a small widget size. Sunrise/Sunset shows the sunrise and sunset times for each day.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-918889" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/weather-app-widgets.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" /><br/>
<h2 id="digital_clock_widget">Digital Clock Widget</h2><br/>
There is a new Digital Clock widget that can be added to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/home-screen/">Home Screen</a> or Lock Screen.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-918894" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/ios-17-2-clock-widget.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" /><br/>
<h2 id="contact_posters">Contact Posters</h2><br/>
You can now select rainbow-colored text for your name when setting up a Contact Poster in the Contacts app.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-918893" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/ios-17-2-contact-poster-rainbow.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" /><br/>
<h2 id="books_page-turning_animation">Books Page-Turning Animation</h2><br/>
There's a "Fast Fade" option for the page-turning animation in the Books app. Apple has also removed the icon that you could turn on to scroll through content quickly.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-918897" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/ios-17-2-page-turn-animation.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" /><br/>
<h2 id="airplay">AirPlay</h2><br/>
There's now an "<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airplay/">AirPlay</a> Receiver" setting that will allow the upcoming &zwnj;Apple Vision Pro&zwnj; headset to stream or share content to an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-918898" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/ios-17-2-airplay-handoff.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" /><br/>
<h2 id="memoji">Memoji</h2><br/>
Apple added a "Body" section for Memoji where users can customize waist, bust, shoulders, and arms.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-918895" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/ios-17-2-memoji-body.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" /><br/>
<h2 id="news_app">News App</h2><br/>

<h2 id="expanded_sensitive_content_warnings">Expanded Sensitive Content Warnings</h2><br/>
Apple's opt-in Sensitive Content Warning feature <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/09/ios-17-2-expands-sensitive-content-warnings/">is expanding</a> to Contact Posters in the Contacts and Phone apps, as well as in stickers in the Messages app. Sensitive Content Warnings use on-device machine learning to blur out photos or videos with any nudity detected before users view them.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-922023" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/Sensitive-Content-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" /><br/>
<h2 id="app_store_categories">App Store Categories</h2><br/>
The "Apps" and "Games" sections of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a> have <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/09/ios-17-2-beta-app-store/">new top bar navigation</a> that allows users to scroll through various app categories, exploring apps in that category with a tap.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-922085" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/app-store-categories.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" /><br/>
The categories mirror the categories that can be found at the bottom of each &zwnj;App Store&zwnj; section, and it is a layout that Apple has previously used for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-arcade/">Apple Arcade</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="siri">Siri</h2><br/>
<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a> in iOS 17.2 <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/05/ios-17-2-allows-siri-to-access-health-data/">can access data</a> from the Health app, so the personal assistant can provide details on Health information. You can, for example, ask &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; questions like "What's my heart rate?" or "How many steps have I taken today?" if that data is logged in the Health app via an accompanying Apple Watch.<br/>
<br/>
&zwnj;Siri&zwnj; also provides details on an estimated time of arrival when there are active turn-by-turn directions in the Maps app, and the personal assistant can provide altitude data.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="airdrop">AirDrop</h2><br/>
AirDrop <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/07/ios-17-namedrop-like-wallet-passes-sharing/">now supports</a> the sharing of boarding passes, movie tickets, and other eligible Wallet app passes by bringing two iPhones next to one another and following the "Share" prompts.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/12/AirDrop-1Pass-Feature-2.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-925566" /><br/>
<h2 id="recording_to_an_external_device">Recording to an External Device</h2><br/>
With the &zwnj;iPhone 15 Pro&zwnj; models, ProRes video can be recorded directly to an external device. iOS 17.2 appears to include a new pop up message that lets users know that external recording is not working because of a USB-C cable that is too slow.<br/>
<br/>
There was previously a warning about an external storage device not having a fast enough write speed to support external recording, but now there is an added message about the write speed of the USB-C cable.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="applecare_settings">AppleCare Settings</h2><br/>
The "Coverage" section under Settings &gt; General has been renamed <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/applecare/">AppleCare</a> &amp; Warranty. It still includes &zwnj;AppleCare&zwnj; info for your &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; and connected devices such as the Apple Watch and AirPods.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-924448" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/applecare-warranty-ios-17-2.jpg" alt="" width="2452" height="1379" /><br/>
The &zwnj;AppleCare&zwnj;+ "Coverage" menu is now in Settings &gt; General rather than Settings &gt; General &gt; About, making it more visible than before. The Coverage interface lists &zwnj;AppleCare&zwnj;+ on your device and any paired AirPods.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="default_notification_sound">Default Notification Sound</h2><br/>
Under Sounds &amp; Haptics, there's a "Default Alerts" section that allows you to choose the sound used for all incoming notifications aside from texts, mail alerts, and calendar alerts, which already had customization options.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-924433" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/ios-17-default-alert.jpg" alt="" width="5526" height="3108" /><br/>
All of the text tones can be used for the default notification sound, plus there is an option to also change the haptic vibration of default notifications.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="autofill_for_pdfs">AutoFill for PDFs</h2><br/>
Enhanced AutoFill for PDFs identifies fields in PDFs and other documents, and allows them to be filled in with information stored in the contacts app. As with websites, fields like names, addresses, and phone numbers can be autofilled.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="qi2_support">Qi2 Support</h2><br/>
The update adds Qi2 support to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-13/">iPhone 13</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-14/">iPhone 14</a> models, allowing them to work with wireless chargers that use the Qi2 standard. <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a> models already included Qi2 support.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="wireless_car_charging_bug_fix">Wireless Car Charging Bug Fix</h2><br/>
There is a fix for a bug that was preventing some <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/05/ios-17-2-wireless-charging-bug-fix/">iPhones from wirelessly charging</a> on the wireless charging pads included in a select number of vehicles.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Collaborative <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/">Apple Music</a> playlists, a feature that Apple has promised for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a>, won't be coming in 2023. With today's iOS 17.2 release, Apple updated its &zwnj;iOS 17&zwnj; features list [<a href="https://www.apple.com/ios/ios-17/pdf/iOS_All_New_Features.pdf">PDF</a>] to note that the option to collaborate on playlists has been delayed.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/apple-music-collaborative-playlists.jpg" alt="" width="5484" height="3085" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-918890" /><br/>
Apple tested collaborative playlists in the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/26/ios-17-2-beta-1-features/">early iOS 17.2 betas</a>, but ended up removing the feature in the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/28/ios-17-2-beta-4-features/">fourth iOS 17.2 beta</a>. There were likely bugs in the option that Apple was not able to remedy in time to bring the feature to iOS 17.2, and as iOS 17.2 will be the last publicly available update to &zwnj;iOS 17&zwnj; in 2023, we won't be getting collaborative playlists until 2024.<br/>
<br/>
In the iOS 17.2 beta, playlists gained a "Collaborate" option that created a link to a playlist, and anyone with access to that link was able to add to the playlist. Users had control over who was able to contribute, with an option to approve each person that asked to join and tools for removing users.<br/>
<br/>
It is not clear when collaborative playlists in &zwnj;Apple Music&zwnj; might launch, but we will likely get an iOS 17.3 update in January, with testing to begin in December.<br/>
<br/>
While collaborative playlists did not come in the iOS 17.2 update, Apple did add a Favorites &zwnj;Apple Music&zwnj; playlist that aggregates songs that are favorited.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-17/">iPadOS 17</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/">Apple Music</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-17.241">iOS 17</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-17.242">iPadOS 17</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/11/apple-music-collaborative-playlists-2024/">Apple Pushes Collaborative Apple Music Playlists Launch to 2024</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-pushes-collaborative-apple-music-playlists-launch-to-2024.2413408/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today updated the <a href="https://www.apple.com/ios/ios-17/">iOS 17 page</a> on its website to indicate that its AirPlay feature for hotel room TVs has been delayed until next year.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/airplay-hotels.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="894" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-898340" /><br/>
Apple originally said the feature was "coming later this year," but it now says it will be "coming in an update in 2024." Apple did not provide a more specific timeframe, but the feature should be added in an iOS 17 update in the first half of next year.<br/>
<br/>
The feature will allow iPhone users to scan a QR code on their hotel room TV to establish an AirPlay connection, allowing them to wirelessly stream videos, photos, and music from their iPhone to the TV. Google already offers a similar feature on some hotel TVs, allowing guests to stream content from their smartphone via Chromecast.<br/>
<br/>
Apple in June said Holiday Inn owner IHG Hotels & Resorts would be one of the first hotel companies to adopt the feature, while LG <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/06/22/lg-airplay-hotel-room-tvs/">announced</a> that it would be one of the first hotel room TV manufacturers to support the feature.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-17/">iPadOS 17</a></div><div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airplay/">AirPlay</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-17.241">iOS 17</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-17.242">iPadOS 17</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/11/apple-delays-airplay-in-hotel-rooms/">Apple Delays iOS 17&#039;s AirPlay in Hotel Room Feature Until 2024</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-delays-ios-17s-airplay-in-hotel-room-feature-until-2024.2413403/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[After Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/08/beeper-mini-imessage-for-android-shutdown/">shut down the mechanism</a> that Android app Beeper Mini was using to bring iMessage to Android users, Beeper Mini's developers today said that they have <a href="https://blog.beeper.com/p/beeper-mini-is-back">found a way to bring the app back</a>, albeit with some major changes.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/12/beeper-mini.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="800" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-925247" /><br/>
The new version of the app requires users to sign in with an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-id/">Apple ID</a>, which was not needed with the prior version. All iMessages are also now sent and received through an email address rather than a phone number, though a fix is in development.<br/>
<br/>
The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/05/beeper-mini-brings-imessage-to-android/">prior version of Beeper Mini</a> did not require an &zwnj;Apple ID&zwnj;, and it registered each Android user's phone number with Apple's iMessage servers without Apple's permission. The app's developers used reverse engineered iMessage protocols for the initial Beeper Mini release, taking advantage of Apple's iMessage servers.<br/>
<br/>
Registering Android phone numbers with iMessage servers allowed Android users to send blue bubble messages to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> users, and the app supported all iMessage functionality, including read receipts, typing indicators, reactions, and more.<br/>
<br/>
Apple was not keen on a third-party app registering non-iPhone numbers with its iMessage servers, and Apple ended up <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/08/beeper-mini-imessage-for-android-shutdown/">blocking Beeper Mini on Friday</a>. Beeper Mini users were unable to send and receive messages when Apple made a change to its iMessage servers, and Beeper Mini founder Eric Migicovsky said at the time that Apple had found a way to stop Beeper Mini from working.<br/>
<br/>
Apple on Saturday <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/10/apple-confirms-it-shut-down-beeper-mini/">released a statement</a> confirming that it took steps to shut down Beeper Mini. Apple said that the techniques that the app used posed risks to the security and privacy of iMessage users.<br/>
<blockquote>At Apple, we build our products and services with industry-leading privacy and security technologies designed to give users control of their data and keep personal information safe. We took steps to protect our users by blocking techniques that exploit fake credentials in order to gain access to iMessage. These techniques posed significant risks to user security and privacy, including the potential for metadata exposure and enabling unwanted messages, spam, and phishing attacks. We will continue to make updates in the future to protect our users.</blockquote><br/>
In a blog post, the Beeper Mini team said that Beeper Mini had the "fastest growing paid Android application in history," with more than 100,000 downloads. This is evidence that Android and &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; customers "desperately want to be able to chat together" with all of the features available on iMessage.<br/>
<blockquote>The reason for its success is clear: Android and iPhone customers desperately want to be able to chat together with high quality images/video, encryption, emojis, typing status, read receipts, and all modern chat features. We all want a fun, easy and secure way to chat. For a glorious 3 days last week, Beeper Mini made this possible.</blockquote><br/>
Beeper Mini's developers say that despite reaching out to Apple, they have not heard back. It is unlikely that Apple will give in and allow Beeper Mini to function as it did, and Apple may shut down further functionality as well if it can.<br/>
<br/>
There were questions about whether Apple would be able to put a stop to Beeper Mini because of the way that it mimicked an Apple device and registered phone numbers as Apple users, but Apple found a way. Apple does have plans to bring all iMessage like features to chats between iMessage users and Android users through <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/rcs/">RCS</a>, a protocol that <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/16/apple-to-adopt-rcs-messaging-standard/">Apple will add to iPhones next year</a>.<br/>
<br/>
&zwnj;RCS&zwnj; will bring support for high quality video and images, emoji reactions, typing indicators, read receipts, and more, all features that Beeper Mini says that Android and &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; users are desperate to have in cross-platform chats.<br/>
<br/>
While Beeper Mini was a paid app with a 7-day free trial, Beeper Mini's developers plan to make it free because of the instability of the app. "Things have been a bit chaotic and we're not comfortable subjecting paying users to this," reads the blog post. Beeper Mini will be a subscription app again "as soon as things stabilize."<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/google/">Google</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/android/">Android</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/imessage/">iMessage</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/messages/">Messages</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/rcs/">RCS</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/11/beeper-mini-android-imessage-app-back/">iMessage for Android App &#039;Beeper Mini&#039; is Back, Apple ID Sign In Now Required and Phone Numbers Don&#039;t Work</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/imessage-for-android-app-beeper-mini-is-back-apple-id-sign-in-now-required-and-phone-numbers-dont-work.2413400/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[With the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/11/apple-releases-ios-17-2-and-ipados-17-2/">launch of iOS 17.2 and iPadOS 17.2</a>, Apple made a server side change that removes the option to purchase and access TV shows and movies from the iTunes Store app.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/12/ios-17-2-itunes-app.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-926061" /><br/>
Attempting to access the TV Shows and Movies sections in the app directs users to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a> app instead. "iTunes Movies and Your Purchases Have Moved," reads the app's message. "You can buy or rent movies and find your purchases in the &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj; app."<br/>
<br/>
During the beta testing process, the iTunes Store app continued to offer access to TV shows and movies, so this is a change that Apple made to its servers. With this update, Apple says <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201783">in a support document</a> that it is no longer possible to gift movies or TV shows on an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> running iOS 17.2 or later, on an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> running iPadOS 17.2 or later, or on an &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj; running tvOS 17.2 or later. <br/>
<br/>
Apple made the same tweak to tvOS 17.2 <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/06/apple-itunes-movies-tv-show-apps-tvos-17-2/">during the tvOS 17.2 beta</a> testing process. The standalone iTunes TV and iTunes Movies apps in tvOS are no longer functional, and redirect users to the TV app on the &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj;. Apple also redesigned the look of the TV app on the &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj;, but no notable changes have been made to the &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj; app on the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPad&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
Apple is directing users to the TV app in order to aggregate all TV and movie content in one place. The iTunes Store app on &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; continues to offer options to purchase music.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-17/">iPadOS 17</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-17.241">iOS 17</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-17.242">iPadOS 17</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/11/ios-17-2-itunes-store-tv-movie-removed/">Apple Removes Option to Buy TV Shows and Movies in iOS 17.2 iTunes Store App</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-removes-option-to-buy-tv-shows-and-movies-in-ios-17-2-itunes-store-app.2413397/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today released watchOS 10.2, the newest version of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/watchos-10/">watchOS 10</a> operating system that was <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/18/apple-releases-watchos-10/">released in September</a>. watchOS 10.2 comes over a month after watchOS 10.1, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/26/apple-releases-watchos-10-0-2/">a major update</a> that brought Double Tap support, NameDrop, and more.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-912513" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/watchOS-10-Launch-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2560" height="1440" /><br/>
‌&zwnj;watchOS 10&zwnj;‌‌.2 can be downloaded for free through the Apple Watch app on an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> running <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a> or later by opening it up and going to General &gt; Software Update. To install the new software, the Apple Watch needs to have at least 50 percent battery and it needs to be placed on a charger.<br/>
<br/>
The watchOS 10.2 update adds support for using <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a> to <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2023/12/siri-can-now-help-users-access-and-log-their-health-app-data/">access and record data in the Health app</a> on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch/">Apple Watch Series 9</a> and the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch-ultra/">Apple Watch Ultra 2</a>. Users can ask &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; questions like "How did I sleep last night?" or "How many steps have I taken this week?"<br/>
<br/>
Health data can be added to the Health app through &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; as well with statements like "My weight is 195.3 pounds," or "I've taken my 6:00 p.m. medications." This is functionality that Apple announced with the launch of the newest Apple Watch models, and it is limited to these devices as they are the only Apple Watches that support on-device &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; processing.<br/>
<br/>
watchOS 10.2 also reintroduces an option to swipe to change the Apple Watch face, a feature that was removed in &zwnj;watchOS 10&zwnj; and has been missed by some. Apple's full release notes for the update are below.<blockquote>watchOS 10.2 includes new features, improvements, and bug fixes, including:<br/>
<ul><br/>
 	<li>Access and log Health app data with Siri (Available on Apple Watch Series 9 and Apple Watch Ultra 2)</li><br/>
 	<li>Automatically view Now Playing when in proximity of HomePod (2nd generation) or HomePod mini playing media from Music or Podcasts (Available on - Apple Watch Series 6 and later and Apple Watch Ultra)</li><br/>
 	<li>Enable the ability to swipe to change watch faces in Settings</li><br/>
 	<li>Enable the ability to confirm ending workouts in Settings</li><br/>
 	<li>Prioritize the volume of either the music or trainers' voices in most Fitness+ workouts</li><br/>
 	<li>Resolves an issue that can cause watch faces added in the Watch app on iPhone to not appear on Apple Watch</li><br/>
</ul><br/>
</blockquote><br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today released tvOS 17.2, the second major update to the tvOS 17 operating system that came out in September 2023. tvOS 17.2 comes more than <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/25/apple-releases-tvos-17-1/">a month after tvOS 17.1</a>, an update that expanded the availability of the Enhanced Dialogue feature.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-869857" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/10/Apple-TV-2022-Feature-Blue.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" /><br/>
tvOS 17.2 can be downloaded using the Settings app on the ‌<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a>‌. Go to System > Software Update to get the new software. ‌&zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj;‌ owners who have automatic software updates activated will be upgraded to tvOS 17.2 automatically.<br/>
<br/>
With tvOS 17.2, Apple is introducing upgrades to the &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj; app, which is the central content hub on the device. The app features a sidebar with content from Apple services and streaming services that integrate with the Watch Now tvOS feature.<br/>
<br/>
Apple has included dedicated sections for Search, Watch Now, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-tv-plus/">Apple TV+</a>, Sports, the store for making purchases, and the library that houses purchased TV shows and movies. There are also sections for streaming services like ABC, CBS, Comedy Central, Hulu, ESPN, Discovery, Peacock, Prime Video, and more.<br/>
<br/>
Clicking into each streaming service provides details on what's available on that service, and there is also an updated "My TV" section that replaces the prior "My Channels" section.<br/>
<br/>
Apple has removed the ability to purchase TV shows and movies from the standalone iTunes TV Shows and iTunes Movies apps, and is directing customers to the &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj; app to make purchases. The changes to the TV app are intended to streamline content purchasing and viewing.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_TV">Apple TV (Neutral)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-tv-and-home-theater.100">Apple TV and Home Theater</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/11/apple-releases-tvos-17-2/">Apple Releases tvOS 17.2 With Revamped Apple TV App</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-releases-tvos-17-2-with-revamped-apple-tv-app.2413391/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

<br/>
iPad Air deals have been overshadowed by steeper discounts on the 9th and 10th generation iPads, but you can still get &#36;99 off the M1 iPad Air right now on Amazon.<br/>

<br/>
Moving to Apple Watch models, Amazon has multiple Apple Watch Series 9 devices on sale and available for Christmas delivery. These deals are good second-best prices, and likely the best deals we'll get before the end of the year.<br/>
<br/>
You'll need to clip an on-page coupon in order to see the final sale price at checkout.<br/>

<br/>
For the Apple Watch Ultra 2, sales are very similar to the Series 9 models. You'll find solid second-best prices on multiple models, with guaranteed Christmas delivery to most places in the U.S.<br/>

<br/>
Apple Watch SE shipping estimates are the most dire at this point in the season, with Amazon unable to guarantee Christmas day delivery for the 40mm GPS model. However, the larger 44mm GPS model does have guaranteed Christmas day delivery and both have great &#36;50 discounts right now.<br/>
<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple will begin encouraging artists and record labels to adopt Spatial Audio with royalty incentives, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-12-11/apple-dangles-reward-for-musicians-to-use-high-end-audio-format"><em>Bloomberg</em></a> reports.<br/>
<br/>

Citing sources familiar with the matter, <em>Bloomberg</em> says that Apple will prioritize streams of songs mixed in Dolby Atmos technology in its streaming calculations starting next year. The change will result in higher royalty payments for artists and labels that adopt and expand the technology in their catalogs. Listeners do not have to listen to the Spatial Audio version of a song for artists to be eligible for the added benefits, with the availability of tracks in Dolby Atmos being sufficient. The new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/">Apple Music</a> policy is yet to be publicly announced.<br/>
<br/>
&zwnj;Apple Music&zwnj; <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/05/17/apple-music-spatial-audio-announced/">introduced</a> Spatial Audio support in 2021, using Dolby Atmos technology to ostensibly replicate an in-person music experience with sound coming from various directions around the listener when using compatible audio hardware. In February 2022, Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/02/16/apple-music-spatial-audio-lossless-interview/">announced</a> that over half of the service's subscribers used the feature. Amazon Music similarly provides Dolby Atmos audio at no additional cost, but Spotify has yet to adopt the format. <div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/">Apple Music</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/11/apple-music-to-incentivize-spatial-audio/">Apple Music to Incentivize Artists to Make Songs Available in Spatial Audio</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-music-to-incentivize-artists-to-make-songs-available-in-spatial-audio.2413377/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Samsung has a new <a href="https://howl.me/ck6A9ZkhXNT">Winter sale</a> that began today, offering discounts across monitors, TVs, smartphones, tablets, computers, and home appliances. Many of the deals in this sale are the same prices we tracked during Samsung's Black Friday sale, and some are even beating their all-time low Black Friday prices. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/samsung-best-holiday.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-923404" /><em><small>Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with Samsung. When you click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment, which helps us keep the site running.</small></em><br/>
<br/>
The highlight of the sale is Samsung's ViewFinity S9 5K Smart Monitor at <a href="https://howl.me/ck3bAoFu1ed"><strong>&#36;999.99</strong></a>, down from &#36;1,599.99. This is a new record low price on the monitor, and it beats the previous all-time low price seen at Amazon last week by a few dollars.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://howl.me/ck6A9ZkhXNT"target="_blank"><div class="fancybutton"><div class="fancybadge">SITEWIDE SALE</div>Samsung's Winter Sale</div></a></div><br/>
<br/>
Additionally, the Smart Monitor M8 is at its all-time low price on Amazon, available for <a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2FB0C3WMX69W%2Fref%3Dox_sc_act_title_1%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26smid%3DATVPDKIKX0DER%26th%3D1%26geniuslink%3Dtrue"><strong>&#36;399.99</strong></a> (&#36;300 off). This has been one of the all-around best monitor deals we've tracked during this holiday season, and it's hard to say if it'll return after this sale ends, so if you want it for Christmas be sure to place an order soon.<br/>
<br/>
Samsung is encouraging users to shop through the Shop Samsung mobile app this season, which has some exclusive deals and deep discounts on smartphones, smartwatches, and mobile accessories. Clicking any of the Samsung links in this post while on mobile should give you the option to install the app.<br/>
<br/>
Other than monitors and TVs, we're also now tracking quite a few deals on refrigerators, tablets, and computers below. These sale prices will be live for this week only, so be sure to check out Samsung's event before the best prices of the year disappear.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[With no new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a> models launched this year, Apple ostensibly has some significant changes in store for its tablet lineup and accessories in 2024.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2019/03/ipad-fall-2022-lineup-details.jpg" alt="" width="2038" height="960" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-870294" /><em>Apple's entire &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; lineup as of December 2023.</em></div><br/>
The entry-level &zwnj;iPad&zwnj;, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-mini/">iPad mini</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/">iPad Air</a>, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a> models are all reportedly due a hardware update in 2024. Here's how the lineup of 2024 could compare to today based on rumors:<br/>
<br/>
<table class="comparison"><br/>
 <tr><br/>
 <th>2023</th><br/>
 <th>2024</th><br/>

 </tr><br/>
</table><br/>
<div class="clear"></div><br/>
<br/>
Apple is also reportedly <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/06/ipad-air-ipad-pro-2024-refresh/">working on a new Apple Pencil</a> and a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/27/new-ipad-pro-and-redesigned-magic-keyboard/">redesigned Magic Keyboard</a> accessory for the &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/03/gurman-new-ipad-magic-keyboard-to-feature-aluminum/">with an aluminum top case</a> and a larger trackpad. The &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; accessory lineup could look as follows by the end of next year:<br/>
<br/>
<table class="comparison"><br/>

 </tr><br/>

 <td>High-end Magic Keyboard for &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj;</td><br/>
 </tr><br/>
</table><br/>
<div class="clear"></div><br/>
<br/>
In his latest <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2023-12-10/apple-aapl-to-fix-confusing-ipad-lineup-with-new-ipad-pro-mid-tier-ipad-air-lpzjekw4">"Power On" newsletter</a>, <em>Bloomberg</em>'s <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a> said that Apple is seeking to reduce confusion between the &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; next year by introducing OLED displays, an updated design, the M3 chip, and a revamped Magic Keyboard accessory on the high-end models. This "will make it unmistakably the highest-end model," Gurman says. <br/>
<br/>
He also highlighted that the &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; will feature slightly different display sizes, just like the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/">MacBook Air</a> and MacBook Pro, where the high-end models have larger screens. The ninth-generation &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; will reportedly be discontinued upon the release of the 11th-generation version, allowing the company to ultimately phase out the first-generation &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
Apple also plans to use the Magic Keyboard as a differentiator for the &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; in 2024. The redesigned version of the accessory will not be compatible with the &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj;, being exclusive to the &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj;. The 10.9- and 12.9-inch &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; models will only be able to use the current Magic Keyboard accessories. <br/>
<br/>
Gurman said that the new &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; models are due to launch around March 2024, with the updated entry-level &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPad mini&zwnj; set to arrive later in the year.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/">iPad Air </a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-mini/">iPad mini</a></div><div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/bloomberg-com/">Bloomberg</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPad">iPad (Caution)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPad-Air">iPad Air (Don't Buy)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#11-iPad-Pro">11" iPad Pro (Don't Buy)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#12-9-iPad-Pro">12.9" iPad Pro (Caution)</a>, <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPad_Mini">iPad Mini (Caution)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipad.137">iPad</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/11/what-the-2024-ipad-lineup-could-look-like/">Here&#039;s What the iPad Lineup Could Look Like in 2024</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/heres-what-the-ipad-lineup-could-look-like-in-2024.2413375/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Heading into 2024, there are several preannounced or rumored iOS 17 and iOS 18 features that are expected to launch throughout the year.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/12/iOS-17-and-18-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-925944" /><br/>
Below, we have listed seven iOS features that should be released for the iPhone in 2024, including collaborative Apple Music playlists, AirPlay on hotel room TVs, app sideloading in the European Union, next-generation CarPlay, roadside assistance via satellite outside of the U.S., RCS support in the Messages app, and generative AI for Siri.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Collaborative Apple Music Playlists</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/apple-music-collaborative-playlist.jpg" alt="" width="2250" height="1266" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-898803" /><br/>
A new Collaborative Playlists option for Apple Music will allow multiple people to add, reorder, and remove songs in a shared playlist.<br/>
<br/>
This feature was <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ios-17-2-beta-features/">initially expected to launch with iOS 17.2</a> this month, but it was removed from that update towards the end of beta testing for reasons unclear. Apple's website now says the feature <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/11/apple-music-collaborative-playlists-2024/">will return as part of an iOS 17 update coming in 2024</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>AirPlay on Hotel Room TVs</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/airplay-hotels.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="894" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-898340" /><br/>
Following the release of iOS 17.2, Apple updated its website to indicate that an AirPlay feature for hotel room TVs has been <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/11/apple-delays-airplay-in-hotel-rooms/">delayed until next year</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Apple originally said the feature was "coming later this year," but it now says it will be "coming in an update in 2024." Apple did not provide a more specific timeframe, but the feature should be added in an iOS 17 update in the first half of next year.<br/>
<br/>
The feature will allow iPhone users to scan a QR code on their hotel room TV to establish an AirPlay connection, allowing them to wirelessly stream videos, photos, and music from their iPhone to the TV. Google already offers a similar feature on some hotel TVs, allowing guests to stream content from their smartphone via Chromecast.<br/>
<br/>
Apple in June said Holiday Inn owner IHG Hotels & Resorts would be one of the first hotel companies to adopt the feature.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>App Sideloading in EU</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/01/iOS-App-Store-General-Feature-JoeBlue.jpg" alt="" width="2250" height="1266" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-833073" /><br/>
<em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman last year reported that Apple was <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/12/13/apple-europe-alternate-app-store-support/">preparing to allow app sideloading on the iPhone</a> in order to comply with the European Union's Digital Markets Act. This would allow users to install apps outside of Apple's App Store, but the change is only expected to be made in European Union countries, at least initially.<br/>
<br/>
Gurman recently said that he expects app sideloading in the EU to roll out in an iOS 17 update released <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/13/eu-iphone-app-sideloading-coming-2024/">in the first half of 2024</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Next-Generation CarPlay</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/06/next-generation-carplay-multi-display.jpg" alt="" width="1960" height="1102" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-848463" /><br/>
At WWDC in June 2022, Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/06/06/apple-announces-multi-display-carplay/">previewed the next generation of CarPlay</a>, promising deeper integration with vehicle functions like A/C and FM radio, support for multiple displays across the dashboard, increased personalization, and more.<br/>
<br/>
Apple's website <a href="https://www.apple.com/ios/carplay/">still says</a> the first vehicles with support for the next-generation CarPlay experience will be announced in "late 2023," but with only a few weeks remaining in the year, it's unclear if that timeframe will still be met. Regardless, the next-generation CarPlay experience would likely not be available to customers until 2024.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Roadside Assistance via Satellite Outside U.S.</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/apple-roadside-assistance.jpg" alt="" width="1596" height="897" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-910510" /><br/>
Starting with iOS 17, all iPhone 14 and iPhone 15 models offer a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/20/iphone-roadside-assistance-feature-tested/">roadside assistance via satellite feature</a> that allows users in the U.S. to contact roadside assistance company AAA for vehicle service when outside of cellular and Wi-Fi coverage.<br/>
<br/>
Apple said the feature is available "beginning" in the U.S., so it will likely expand to some additional countries starting in 2024.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>RCS Support</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/07/General-Apps-Messages.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1407" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-808613" /><br/>
In November, Apple announced that it will <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/16/apple-to-adopt-rcs-messaging-standard/">support the cross-platform messaging standard RCS</a> in the Messages app on the iPhone starting "later next year," so it will likely be an iOS 18 feature based on that timeframe.<br/>
<br/>
RCS support should result in the following improvements to the default messaging experience between iPhones and Android devices:<ul><br/>
 <li>Higher-resolution photos and videos</li><br/>
 <li>Audio messages</li><br/>
 <li>Typing indicators</li><br/>
 <li>Read receipts</li><br/>
 <li>Wi-Fi messaging between iPhones and Android devices</li><br/>
 <li>Improved group chats, including the ability for iPhone users to leave a conversation that includes Android users</li><br/>
 <li>Improved encryption compared to SMS</li><br/>
</ul>These modern features are already available for iPhone-to-iPhone conversations with blue bubbles, via iMessage, and many of the features are also available in third-party messaging apps, such as WhatsApp and Telegram. RCS support on the iPhone will extend the features to green bubbles in the Messages app.<br/>

<h2>Smarter Siri</h2><br/>

<em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman expects <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/22/apple-generative-ai-features-and-smarter-siri/">iOS 18 to feature generative AI technology</a> that "should improve how both Siri and the Messages app can field questions and auto-complete sentences." He said Apple has also explored generative AI features for other apps across its platforms, including Apple Music, Pages, Keynote, and Xcode.<br/>
<br/>
<em>The Information</em> reported that Apple plans to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/06/ios-18-siri-improvements/">incorporate large language models into Siri</a> to let users automate complex tasks, a feature that would involve deeper integration with the Shortcuts app. The report said this feature is expected to be released in an iPhone software update coming next year, which would likely be iOS 18.<br/>
<br/>
Generative AI surged in popularity last year when OpenAI released ChatGPT, a chatbot that can respond to questions and other prompts. Google and Microsoft released similar chatbots earlier this year, as more companies race into the space. The chatbots are trained on large language models, allowing them to respond like a human.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-17/">iPadOS 17</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/">iOS 18</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-17.241">iOS 17</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-17.242">iPadOS 17</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/11/new-ios-17-and-ios-18-features-expected-in-2024/">These Seven New iOS 17 and iOS 18 Features Are Expected Next Year</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/these-seven-new-ios-17-and-ios-18-features-are-expected-next-year.2413373/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Vision Pro customers will likely be pushed to pick up the device at an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-store/">Apple Store</a>, <em>Bloomberg</em>'s <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2023-12-10/apple-aapl-to-fix-confusing-ipad-lineup-with-new-ipad-pro-mid-tier-ipad-air-lpzjekw4">Mark Gurman reports</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/vision-pro-components.jpg" alt="" width="2034" height="1144" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-898850" /><br/>
In October, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/22/apple-to-host-secretive-vision-pro-training-event/">Gurman reported</a> that Apple was in the process of inviting retail store employees from each &zwnj;Apple Store&zwnj; in the United States to Cupertino, California to receive training on using and selling the Vision Pro headset. Apple apparently sent a memo to retail employees asking them to apply for the "secretive" event, with acceptance dependent on an application and interview process. An extract from the memo read:<blockquote>Selected team members will travel and participate in an event in Cupertino, California, at some point in the first months of 2024. Upon returning to their home store, they'll deliver training and ongoing support to store team members. This is a group opportunity for those who have a deep passion for demonstrating Apple products and teaching others.</blockquote><br/>
<br/>
In the latest <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2023-12-10/apple-aapl-to-fix-confusing-ipad-lineup-with-new-ipad-pro-mid-tier-ipad-air-lpzjekw4">"Power On" newsletter</a>, Gurman said that these seminars are now being scheduled with staff training set to start in mid-January. Each &zwnj;Apple Store&zwnj; employee in attendance will receive two days of training, featuring instructions on the Vision Pro's setup process, approaching a customer, and placing the device on a user's head. Gurman previously said that flagship retail stores are set to gain dedicated Vision Pro hands-on areas, while other stores will only receive one or two units.<br/>
<br/>
Gurman noted that "while customers will be able to reserve a Vision Pro online, it increasingly sounds like they'll be pushed to pick up the device at a store" with an appointment. Apple is planning to assemble customers' Vision Pro headsets in-store, compiling the appropriate headband, light seal, and optional prescription lenses. Retail stores are purportedly due to receive new equipment to assemble and package the headset in the near future. <br/>
<br/>
Gurman still believes that the device will likely be released before March. Apple simply says that the Vision Pro headset will launch in "early" 2024.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/retail/">Retail</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/bloomberg-com/">Bloomberg</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/">Mark Gurman</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-vision-pro.209">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/11/apple-to-push-vision-pro-customers-to-pick-up/">Apple Preparing to Push Vision Pro Customers to Pick-Up at an Apple Store</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-preparing-to-push-vision-pro-customers-to-pick-up-at-an-apple-store.2413366/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple supplier Samsung Display has reorganized its Apple business team to achieve operational efficiency in the development of foldable panels, claims a new report out of Korea.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/10/Foldable-iPhone-2023-Feature-Blue.jpg" alt="" width="1458" height="820" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-797663" /><br/>
According to <em><a href="https://www.thelec.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=24647">The Elec</a></em>, Samsung wants to strengthen its capabilities in anticipation of Apple's first foldable products by integrating the expertise it has gained making Samsung foldable devices since 2019. <br/>
<br/>
Samsung Display and LG Display are said to be already working on projects for Apple's foldable products, including panels with 20.25-inch dimensions, according to the report. It's not clear if the panel size relates to a specific product or a panel production process.<br/>
<br/>
Apple has been known to be working on foldable display technology for some years now, filing multiple patents regarding the technology. Rumors in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2020/09/10/apple-orders-samsung-foldable-display-samples/">September 2020</a> indicated that Samsung was providing foldable display samples to Apple for a future foldable ‌iPhone‌, but there had been no strong indication that Apple was planning to use Samsung's technology until now.<br/>
<br/>
In 2021, <em>Bloomberg</em> claimed that Apple had started "<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/15/iphone-13-in-display-fingerprint-sensor/">early work</a>" on an ‌iPhone‌ with a foldable display, but that it had not committed to releasing a foldable device at that time. Development in 2021 had not expanded beyond a display, and Apple did not have full foldable ‌iPhone‌ prototypes. <br/>
<br/>
Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo initially <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/20/kuo-iphones-with-under-screen-touch-id-now-coming-in-2023-foldable-iphone-in-2024/">said</a> that Apple would introduce a foldable ‌iPhone‌ in 2024, but in 2022, he revised his prediction and said that Apple is unlikely to unveil a foldable iPhone until <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/04/01/apple-testing-9-inch-foldable/">2025 or later</a>. Display analyst Ross Young has also suggested <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/02/21/apple-exploring-20-inch-foldable-macbook/">2025</a> is the earliest that we might see a foldable ‌iPhone‌.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/samsung/">Samsung</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/foldable-iphone/">Foldable iPhone</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/11/apple-foldable-panels-samsung-display/">Samsung Display Readies Development Team for Apple Foldable Panels</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/samsung-display-readies-development-team-for-apple-foldable-panels.2413363/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>
