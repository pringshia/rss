		<description><![CDATA[Best Buy's Cyber Monday sale has transitioned into a <a href="https://howl.me/ck6b1vcE1Me">"Holiday Deals" event</a> that's promising new discounts and offers every day for the next 20 days. For today, the focus is on a few laptop deals, including the 13-inch M2 MacBook Air.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/best-buy-cyber-week.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-924428" /><em><small>Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with some of these vendors. When you click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment, which helps us keep the site running.</small></em><br/>
<br/>
As with the Black Friday and Cyber Monday deals we saw, some of the discounts below require a <a href="https://howl.me/ck6bXDtyIMr">My Best Buy Plus or My Best Buy Total membership</a>. These start at &#36;49.99/year and grant members early access to sales, exclusive discounts on select products, and more.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><a href="https://howl.me/ck6b1vcE1Me"target="_blank"><div class="fancybutton"><div class="fancybadge">Sitewide Sale</div>Best Buy Holiday Deals Event</div></a></div><h2>MacBook Air</h2><br/>

<br/>
The highlight of the sale is Apple's 256GB 13.6-inch M2 MacBook Air for <a href="https://howl.me/ck6bCMrS1iS"><strong>&#36;949.00</strong></a>, down from &#36;1,099.00. Best Buy has this sale price in all four colors, and it represents a solid second-best price on the 2022 notebook.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/28/apple-releases-ios-17-2-beta-4/">fourth beta of iOS 17.2</a> that Apple released today adds a much-desired feature, the option to change the default notification alert.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/ios-17-default-alert.jpg" alt="" width="5526" height="3108" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-924433" /><br/>
Under Sounds & Haptics, there's a new "Default Alerts" section that allows you to choose the sound used for all incoming notifications aside from texts, mail alerts, and calendar alerts, which already had customization options. <br/>
<br/>
Apple has not previously offered an interface for tweaking the default notification sound, so this is a notable update for those who have always wanted to select a sound. All of the text tones can be used for the default notification sound.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">iOS 17.2 beta 4 allows you to change the default notification sound and haptic <a href="https://t.co/f7Vxny3Jcc">pic.twitter.com/f7Vxny3Jcc</a></p>&mdash; iSoftware Updates (@iSWUpdates) <a href="https://twitter.com/iSWUpdates/status/1729568826751152479?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 28, 2023</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div><br/>
There's also an option to change the default haptic feedback. Apple in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a> changed the haptic alert, and now it can be changed back or customized for those who were not happy with the update. <div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-17/">iPadOS 17</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-17.241">iOS 17</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-17.242">iPadOS 17</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/28/ios-17-2-change-default-notification/">iOS 17.2 Beta Adds Option to Change Default Notification Sound and Haptics</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-17-2-beta-adds-option-to-change-default-notification-sound-and-haptics.2412271/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today released the fourth betas of upcoming iOS 17.2 and iPadOS 17.2 updates to developers for testing purposes, with the software coming two weeks after Apple released the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/14/apple-seeds-ios-17-2-beta-3-to-developers/">the third of iOS 17.2 and iPadOS 17.2</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-918852" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/iOS-17.2-Feature-Cool.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" /><br/>
Registered developers are able to opt into the betas by opening up the Settings app, going to the Software Update section, tapping on the "Beta Updates" option, and toggling on the ‌<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a> or <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-17/">iPadOS 17</a>‌ Developer Beta. An <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-id/">Apple ID</a> associated with a developer account is required to download and install the beta.<br/>
<br/>
The biggest new feature in iOS 17.2 is the Journal app, which can be used to record daily activities and thoughts. You can write about your day to day life, but Apple also provides topic suggestions based on the music you listen to, the places you visit, and the people you see. Journal entries support pictures, voice recordings, and location information, with the app organized by entry date.<br/>
<br/>
In <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/">Apple Music</a>, there's a Favorites playlist that houses everything you've favorited, plus Apple added support for collaborative playlists. You can now share a playlist with multiple people, and each participant can add songs.<br/>
<br/>
Stickers can now be used to reply to iMessages when you long press on a chat bubble in the Messages app, and there's also now support for the extra-secure iMessage Contact Key Verification option. If you have an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro</a>, the Action Button supports Translate in iOS 17.2, and there are new Weather and Clock widgets.<br/>
<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today seeded the fourth beta of an upcoming watchOS 10.2 update to developers for testing purposes, with the beta coming two weeks after Apple seeded the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/14/apple-seeds-watchos-10-2-beta-3-to-developers/">third watchOS 10.2 beta</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-901009" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/Apple-Watch-Faces-watchOS-10-Feature-Blue.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" /><br/>
To install the ‌watchOS 10.2‌ update, developers will need to open the Apple Watch app, go to the Software Update section under "General" in Settings, and toggle on the ‌<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/watchos-10/">watchOS 10</a>‌ Developer Beta. An <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-id/">Apple ID</a> linked to a developer account is required.<br/>
<br/>
Once beta updates have been activated, ‌&zwnj;watchOS 10&zwnj;‌ can be downloaded under the same Software Update section. To install software, an Apple Watch needs to have 50 percent battery life and it must be placed on an Apple Watch charger.<br/>
<br/>
watchOS 10.2 adds support for iMessage Contact Key Verification, a feature designed for those who face "extraordinary digital threats," such as journalists, human rights activists, and government officials.<br/>
<br/>
Users can ensure that there is no "man in the middle" snooping on iMessage conversations, and there is a Contact Verification Code so that iMessage users can verify that they're speaking to the correct individual during in-person meetings or on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/facetime/">FaceTime</a> calls.<br/>
<br/>
The update also reintroduces an option to change watch faces by swiping left and right.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/watchos-10/">watchOS 10</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-programming.135">Apple Programming</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/28/apple-seeds-watchos-10-2-beta-4-to-developers/">Apple Seeds Fourth Beta of watchOS 10.2 to Developers</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-seeds-fourth-beta-of-watchos-10-2-to-developers.2412266/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today seeded the fourth beta of an upcoming tvOS 17.2 to developers for testing purposes, with the beta coming two weeks after the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/14/apple-seeds-tvos-17-2-beta-3-to-developers/">release of the third tvOS 17.2 beta</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-869857" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/10/Apple-TV-2022-Feature-Blue.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" /><br/>
Registered developers are able to download the tvOS 17.2 update by opting in to the beta through the Settings app on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a>. A registered developer account is required.<br/>
<br/>
tvOS updates are often minor in scale compared to other operating system updates, focusing primarily on bug fixes and smaller improvements rather than notable outward-facing changes, but tvOS 17.2 introduces an overhauled &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj; app. <br/>
<br/>
The app now includes a sidebar that houses content from both Apple's services and streaming services that integrate with the tvOS Watch Now feature. There are dedicated sections for Search, Watch Now, ‌<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-tv-plus/">Apple TV+</a>‌, MLS Season Pass, Sports, the Store, and the Library at the top of the sidebar, along with dedicated sections for streaming services like ABC, CBS, Comedy Central, Hulu, ESPN, Discovery, Peacock, Prime Video, and more.<br/>
<br/>
You can click into each streaming service to see content that's available specifically on that service, and there's also a new My TV section that replaces "My Channels."<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_TV">Apple TV (Neutral)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-tv-and-home-theater.100">Apple TV and Home Theater</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/28/apple-seeds-tvos-17-2-beta-4-to-developers/">Apple Seeds Fourth Beta of tvOS 17.2 to Developers</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-seeds-fourth-beta-of-tvos-17-2-to-developers.2412267/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[At WWDC in June 2022, Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/06/06/apple-announces-multi-display-carplay/">previewed the next generation of CarPlay</a>, promising deeper integration with vehicle functions like A/C and FM radio, support for multiple displays across the dashboard, increased personalization, and more.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/All-New-CarPlay-Five-New-Features-Article-2.jpg" alt="" width="1960" height="1102" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-918156" /><br/>
Apple's website <a href="https://www.apple.com/ios/carplay/">still says</a> the first vehicles with support for the next-generation CarPlay experience will be announced in "late 2023," but it has not shared any additional details heading into the final month of the year, so it's unclear if that timeframe will still be met. We have reached out to Apple for an update on the matter.<br/>
<br/>
Below, we have recapped five key features to expect from the new version of CarPlay. Apple said committed automakers included Acura, Audi, Ford, Honda, Jaguar, Land Rover, Mercedes-Benz, Nissan, Porsche, Volvo, and a few others.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Next-Generation CarPlay Features</h2><br/>
<h3>Instrument Cluster Integration</h3><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/06/Multi-Display-CarPlay-2.jpeg" alt="" width="1600" height="896" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-848187" /><br/>
The new CarPlay experience will provide integration with a vehicle's instrument cluster, including the speedometer, tachometer, odometer, fuel gauge, engine temperature gauge, oil pressure gauge, and more. Apple says drivers will be able to choose from several gauge cluster designs and layouts, including brand‑specific options.<br/>
<br/>
<h3>Climate Controls</h3><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/07/CarPlay-Next-Generation-Screen.jpg" alt="" width="3562" height="1990" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-853339" /><br/>
You'll be able to access your vehicle's climate controls directly within the new version of CarPlay, allowing you to adjust the temperature of the A/C or heat, fan speed, heated seats, heated steering wheel, and other options.<br/>
<br/>
<h3>Multi-Display Support</h3><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/12/CarPlay-Next-Generation-Multi-Screens.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="897" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-878824" /><br/>
The new version of CarPlay will be able to appear across all of the displays in a vehicle, providing a consistent experience across the infotainment system, instrument cluster, and any additional screens on the dashboard. Apple says CarPlay will be tailored to each new vehicle model to accommodate unique screen shapes and layouts. <br/>
<br/>
<h3>Widgets</h3><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/12/CarPlay-Next-Generation-Widgets.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-878821" /><br/>
Widgets will be a key part of the new CarPlay experience, offering at-a-glance information such as trip duration, fuel economy, distance traveled, calendar events, weather, phone calls, the status of a HomeKit-enabled garage door, and more. It will also be possible to view and scroll through the widgets within the instrument cluster.<br/>
<br/>
<h3>FM Radio App</h3><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/12/CarPlay-Next-Generation-Radio.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="899" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-878822" /><br/>
The new version of CarPlay will include an all-new Radio app that allows you to easily control the FM radio in your vehicle, such as to change the station.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>CarPlay on iOS 17</h2><br/>
In the meantime, CarPlay includes a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/06/13/whats-new-carplay-ios-17/">handful of new features and changes</a> when used with an iPhone running iOS 17, including SharePlay support in the Music app for passengers and real-time electric vehicle charging station availability.<br/>
<br/>

iOS 17 was released in September for the iPhone XS and newer.

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2023/11/apple-unveils-the-top-books-of-2023-and-a-new-year-in-review-experience/">announced</a> that its Books app now offers a "Year in Review" recap in select countries, including the U.S., U.K., Australia, Canada, France, and Germany. The feature requires an iPhone or iPad on iOS 17.1 or iPadOS 17.1 or later, and it can be found within the Read Now tab under Top Picks, for users with at least three titles marked as finished.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/Apple-Books-Year-in-Review.jpg" alt="" width="1306" height="735" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-924332" /><br/>
Year in Review allows Apple Books users to view personalized highlights about the books and audiobooks they read in 2023, including their total time spent reading, the longest book or audiobook they read, their most-read author and genre, their highest-rated book, and more. The recap can easily be shared with others.<br/>
<br/>
How to mark books or audiobooks as finished:<blockquote>To add books or audiobooks, readers can tap and hold on any book in the app and choose Mark as Finished. To change the finished date shown, users can hold down on the book and select Edit Finished Date. For titles read elsewhere, such as in hardcover or paperback, users can search for them in Apple Books and select Mark as Finished to add them to their Year in Review.</blockquote>When the "Reading Goals" option is turned on in the Settings app, under Books, users can also view their longest reading streak, the average number of minutes they spent reading in a month, and other statistics in Year in Review.<br/>
<br/>

Year in Review can determine a user's personal reading type:<blockquote>There are six reader types to discover, including The Contemporary for readers of trendy titles; The Completist for readers of multiple books in a series; The Seeker for nonfiction readers; The Wanderer for multigenre readers; The Deep Diver for single-genre readers; or The Free Spirit for readers with wide-ranging interests across the book world.</blockquote>Apple also shared the most popular books in the Books app in 2023:<blockquote><strong>Top Nonfiction Books of 2023</strong><br/>
1. <em>Spare</em> by Prince Harry, The Duke of Sussex<br/>
2. <em>The Woman in Me</em> by Britney Spears<br/>
3. <em>The Wager: A Tale of Shipwreck, Mutiny and Murder</em> by David Grann<br/>
4. <em>Outlive: The Science and Art of Longevity</em> by Peter Attia and Bill Gifford<br/>

3. <em>Happy Place</em> by Emily Henry<br/>
4. <em>Hello Beautiful</em> by Ann Napolitano<br/>
5. <em>The Covenant of Water</em> by Abraham Verghese</blockquote>As the end of 2023 nears, Apple has started sharing year-end content, including <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/14/apple-announces-app-store-award-finalists-2023/">award-winning apps</a> and the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/28/apple-reveals-most-popular-podcasts-of-2023/">the most popular podcasts</a>.

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today rolled out the <a href="https://replay.music.apple.com/">Apple Music Replay</a> experience for 2023, allowing subscribers to see their top artists, songs, albums, genres, playlists, and stations of the year. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/Apple-Music-Replay-23-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-924302" /><br/>
Users can watch a custom Highlight Reel at the top of the Replay webpage before diving into more detailed information and expanded listening insights. The highlight reel presents a series of social media-style animated cards that show musical highlights from the past year based on your listening history. Relevant music plays in the background for each card. The highlight reel is viewable on desktop browsers, but it appears to be primarily designed for mobile devices.<br/>
<br/>
After the highlight reel, users can scroll down to see featured sections with more informative breakdowns of their top albums and playlists from the past year. Users can add their <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/">Apple Music</a> Replay 2023 playlist to the Music app at the bottom of the page.<br/>
<br/>
Apple has made some changes to the &zwnj;Apple Music&zwnj; Replay experience for 2023, including a darker color palette and new animations in the Highlight Reel. Milestones also can now be viewed on iOS and Highlight sides can be shared directly to social media platforms for the first time. Last year, Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/11/29/apple-music-replay-2022-revamped/">revamped the Apple Music Replay experience</a> by introducing the Highlight Reel and a series of other improvements.<br/>
<br/>
&zwnj;Apple Music&zwnj; Replay is Apple's answer Spotify Wrapped, but &zwnj;Apple Music&zwnj; Replay remains a web browser only experience. The Music app itself can only show and play a basic playlist of your top songs for the year, ranked by most played, once it has been added via the Replay webpage.<br/>

<em><a href="https://www.digitimes.com/news/a20231127PD223.html">DigiTimes</a></em> claims that there are a total of four different second-generation Vision Pro headsets in development, including a direct successor to the first-generation model and a more affordable model. The nature of the other two second-generation models is unclear. <br/>
<br/>
The bill of materials (BOM) for the more affordable headset will reportedly be half that of the first-generation Vision Pro to enable a significantly reduced retail price. Samples of this device are apparently set to begin production in the second half of 2024, with launch following in the second half of 2025 at the earliest.<br/>
<br/>
According to a separate report from <a href="https://www.jiemian.com/article/10448655.html"><em>Interface News</em></a>, Apple has begun to communicate with its supply chain about second- and third-generation Vision Pro products, seeking to reduce costs to bring down prices and boost sales in the future. <em>Interface News</em> also claims that mass production of the first-generation Vision Pro will begin in December with an initial batch of 400,000 units. Apple apparently has a sales target of about one million units for 2024. <br/>
<br/>
The first-generation Vision Pro headset is due to launch early next year in the United States with a starting price of &#36;3,499.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Google Drive users have been warned not to disconnect their account within the Google Drive for desktop app, after a spate of reports of files going missing from the cloud service.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/05/Google-Drive.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="840" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-847028" /><br/>
Alarm bells began ringing last week on Google's community support site when some users reported files <a href="https://support.google.com/drive/thread/245055606/google-drive-files-suddenly-disappeared-the-drive-literally-went-back-to-condition-in-may-2023?hl=en">mysteriously disappearing</a> from Google Drive, with some posters claiming six or months of data had vanished.<br/>
<br/>
As noted by <em><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/11/27/google_drive_files_disappearing/">The Register</a></em>, one user logged into Google Drive to find things as they were in May 2023, with everything saved since that date gone, despite attempts by Google's support team to help them recover the files. Currently, the thread of complaints has 217 users who clicked the "I have the same question."  <br/>
<br/>
The Google Drive team has since <a href="https://support.google.com/drive/thread/245861992/drive-for-desktop-v84-0-0-0-84-0-4-0-sync-issue">posted</a> that it is "investigating reports of an issue impacting a limited subset of Drive for desktop users." In the meantime:<br/>
<ul><li>Do not click "Disconnect account" within Drive for desktop</li><br/>
<li>Do not delete or move the app data folder:<br/>
<strong>Windows:</strong> %USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\Google\DriveFS<br/>
<strong>macOS:</strong> ~/Library/Application Support/Google/DriveFS</li></ul><br/>
Google also recommends making a copy of the app data folder if there's space on your hard drive, until the sync issue is resolved. We'll update this article if we hear more. <div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/google-drive/">Google Drive</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/28/google-drive-files-going-missing/">Some Google Drive Users&#039; Files Have Mysteriously Vanished</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/some-google-drive-users-files-have-mysteriously-vanished.2412233/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's 15-inch <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/">MacBook Air</a> doesn't have a fan, and instead uses a passive heat spreader to conduct heat away from Apple's energy efficient <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m2/">M2</a> chip. Curious to know if performance could be further improved with an active cooling solution, <a href="https://www.froresystems.com">Frore Systems</a> installed its own novel solid-state active cooling system into the laptop and subjected it to several benchmarks, with some impressive results.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/15inch-macbook-air-purple.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-916649" /><br/>
Frore Systems is a startup with &#36;116 million in funding, and its flagship product is the AirJet Mini, a virtually silent thermal solution with a piezoelectric cooling chip that its makers claim performs better than fans. Inside the AirJet are tiny membranes that vibrate at ultrasonic frequencies, pulling air into inlet vents at the top of the AirJet that exits through the bottom as high-velocity pulsating jets.<br/>
<br/>
As shared by <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/27/23975368/frore-airjet-apple-macbook-air-fanless-mems">The Verge</a></em>, head-to-head benchmarking tests initially showed the 15-inch &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; with the AirJet Mini installed performed only slightly better than a standard &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj;, but the modified laptop pulled ahead significantly as the tests wore on and the fanless &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj;'s throttling kicked in to keep the temperature down.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/airjet_mini_frore_difference.jpg.jpg" alt="" width="1440" height="701" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-924275" /><br/>
Despite its slight dimensions, the 2.8mm thick AirJet took some work to install into the &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj;'s slim chassis. Frore had to mill 0.3mm off from the laptop's lid to create adequate space for the airflow system, and also removed the speakers, Wi-Fi antenna, and internal keyboard connector in the process. For the rest of us, buying a MacBook Pro with a fan is definitely an easier option.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/airjet-cooling-macbook-air.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-924270" /><br/>
Another issue that wasn't addressed in the tests was the real-world impact of such a system on battery life. <em>The Verge</em> says the AirJet Mini drew five watts from the &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj;'s USB-C port in the makeshift setup. Frore says its AirJet Mini chips require one watt of power when properly integrated into a laptop, and the system draws as little as 0.1W or 0.2W when idle, with the AirJet Minis themselves staying turned off until or unless they need to blow. <br/>
<br/>
The AirJet system will debut in a &#36;499 barebones Zotac mini-PC that requires constant connection to a power source, a use case in which battery life won't be an issue. But the startup has also prototyped 4K webcams, doorbell cameras, LED light bulbs, and more. It's too early to tell whether Frore's cooling system will be the next big thing in PC cooling tech, but the startup says the AirJet Mini is already in mass production, with larger and smaller versions in development.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/">MacBook Air</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#15-MacBook-Air">15" MacBook Air (Neutral)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macbook-air.122">MacBook Air</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/28/m2-macbook-air-speed-boost-frore-fan/">M2 MacBook Air Gets Speed Boost With This Novel Cooling System</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/m2-macbook-air-gets-speed-boost-with-this-novel-cooling-system.2412230/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple with iOS 17.1 and watchOS 10.1 introduced a new NameDrop feature that is designed to allow users to place Apple devices near one another to quickly exchange contact information. Sharing contact information is done with explicit user permission, but some news organizations and police departments have been spreading misinformation about how functions.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/02/ios-17-namedrop.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-900409" /><br/>
As noted by <em><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/11/27/namedrop-iphone-ios17-safety/">The Washington Post</a></em>, there have been warnings about NameDrop popping up on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/facetime/">FaceTime</a>. Police departments in Pennsylvania, Oklahoma, Ohio, and other states have been suggesting that contact information can be shared "just by bringing your phones close together." From the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ChesterPolicePA">City of Chester Police Department</a> in Ohio:<blockquote>IMPORTANT PRIVACY UPDATE: If you have an iPhone and have done the recent iOS 17 update, they have set a new feature called NameDrop defaulted to ON. This feature allows the sharing of your contact info just by bringing your phones close together. To shut this off go to Settings, General, AirDrop, Bringing Devices Together. Change to OFF.</blockquote><br/>
While it's true that NameDrop is turned on by default, the way that it functions is more nuanced than simply putting two iPhones near each other.<br/>
<br/>
NameDrop works when two iPhones running iOS 17.1 or an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> with iOS 17.1 and an Apple Watch running watchOS 10.1 are placed right next to each other, as in almost touching. When the two devices come in close contact and both are unlocked, there is a pop up prompting users to share contact information or an image.<br/>
<br/>
Contact information is not shared automatically, and it is a user-initiated process that requires both people exchanging information to accept the transfer. While an accidental exchange could occur, it would require a user to unlock their device and accept the sharing prompt for that to occur.<br/>
<br/>
Multiple police departments posted the warning above, which was widely shared on Facebook and other social networks. The message from the Noble County Sheriff's Office in Ohio, for example, got upwards of 70,000 shares, while the Dewey Police Department in Pennsylvania's warning was shared 11,000 times. After criticism from some commenters, Noble County edited its message to clarify that there's a popup to transfer content, and Dewey County said that it was attempting to "get parents engaged with their children," but many people who saw the original post may not see the updates.<br/>
<blockquote>The intent of the post was to get parents engaged with their children and what they are doing on their devices, not the fear mongering as suggested. We suggest everyone do research on new technology and updates to learn more about what is out there, especially for kids</blockquote><br/>
Several local news stories have also shared similar questionable NameDrop information. <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/pittsburgh/news/new-iphone-feature-namedrop-is-on-by-default/">KDKA-TV in Pittsburgh</a>, for example, interviewed several people and included quotes suggesting NameDrop happens automatically.<blockquote>"That's why I turned it off because I don't have a use for it. I don't even have my phone at work so I don't really have a use for it. But I guess a default on could be a bit controversial just because I think giving out your contact should be a conscious decision and not something that could accidentally happen," Jerry said.<br/>
<br/>
"That is a little bit concerning, I think it should be an optional feature instead of automatically happening," said Liz Jones.</blockquote><br/>
If anything, NameDrop has the potential to be more irritating than dangerous, simply because it's likely to activate when your phone is next to someone else's and unlocked, in a situation like a dinner or meeting. Given the negative feedback, Apple may in a future update turn NameDrop off by default, but those who want to disable it now can do so by opening up the Settings app, going to the General section, tapping AirDrop, and turning off "Bringing Devices Together."<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-17/">iPadOS 17</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-17.241">iOS 17</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-17.242">iPadOS 17</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/27/ios-17-namedrop-misinformation/">Police Departments and News Sites Spreading Misinformation About How iOS 17 NameDrop Feature Works</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/police-departments-and-news-sites-spreading-misinformation-about-how-ios-17-namedrop-feature-works.2412190/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple in October refreshed the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/">iMac</a> and MacBook Pro, introducing the first M3 chips with 3-nanometer processors. We've already checked out the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/07/m3-macbook-pro-hands-on/">MacBook Pro with M3 Pro</a> and the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/13/m3-max-macbook-pro-hands-on/">MacBook Pro with M3 Max</a>, so we thought we'd wrap up our M3 review series with the &zwnj;iMac&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xWGO8BydblQ" title="24&quot; M3 iMac Review  - The BEST Mac for Everyone?" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe><em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/macrumors?sub_confirmation=1">Subscribe to the MacRumors YouTube channel</a> for more videos.</em></div><br/>
If you have an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m1/">M1</a> &zwnj;iMac&zwnj;, you're not going to notice any physical differences between the old model and the new model with the M3 chip, because Apple didn't make any updates to the design or the color offerings.<br/>
<br/>
Everything is the exact same, with the thin design, 24-inch Retina display, six-speaker sound system, and a selection of seven two-tone color options.<br/>
<br/>
What's different is the internals, and the jump from &zwnj;M1&zwnj; to M3 is a major update in terms of CPU and GPU speeds. Built on the 3-nanometer process, the M3 chip has some major GPU improvements thanks to Dynamic Caching, hardware-accelerated ray tracing, and mesh shading.<br/>
<br/>
The M3 chip is 2.5x faster than the &zwnj;M1&zwnj; chip when it comes to GPU performance, and it's better than before for gaming, 3D rendering, video editing, and similar tasks. As for the CPU, the performance cores are up to 30 percent faster than the performance cores in the &zwnj;M1&zwnj;, while the efficiency cores are up to 50 percent faster than the &zwnj;M1&zwnj; efficiency cores. In Geekbench benchmarks, the M3 comes in at around 20 percent faster overall.<br/>
<br/>
Depending on what you're doing, there is a notable difference between the &zwnj;M1&zwnj; and M3 in real-world performance and it's great to have an update for a machine that was one of the oldest in Apple's lineup. If you need a desktop Mac for day-to-day tasks, you're not going to be disappointed with the M3 &zwnj;iMac&zwnj;.<br/>
<br/>
If you're holding out for a larger &zwnj;iMac&zwnj; with Apple silicon, Apple doesn't think you should wait. The company confirmed there are no plans <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/06/no-27-inch-with-apple-silicon/">for another 27-inch iMac</a>, and Apple recommends that customers who need a bigger and better desktop computer turn to the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-studio/">Mac Studio</a> and the Studio Display.<br/>
<br/>
That said, there are rumors that Apple is working on an &zwnj;iMac&zwnj; that has a display somewhere around 30 inches, but it's not yet clear when that model might be coming out, and it seems to be at least a year or two away.<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple will likely release iOS 17.1.2 this week, based on mounting evidence of the software in our website's analytics logs in recent days. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/iOS-17.1.2-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-923208" /><br/>
As a minor update, iOS 17.1.2 should be focused on bug fixes, but it's unclear exactly which issues might be addressed. Some users have continued to experience Wi-Fi issues on iOS 17.1.1, so perhaps iOS 17.1.2 will include the same <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/30/ios-17-2-beta-addresses-wifi-issues/">fix for Wi-Fi connectivity issues</a> that Apple already included in the iOS 17.2 beta. Some users have also experienced minor bugs related to push notifications, HomeKit, and more.<br/>
<br/>
iOS 16.1.2 was released during the week after U.S. Thanksgiving last year, so there is precedent for a bug-fix update being released this week.<br/>
<br/>
iOS 17.1.2 would be the second bug-fix update for the iPhone this month after iOS 17.1.1, which <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/07/apple-releases-ios-17-1-1/">fixed a BMW wireless charging issue</a> affecting the iPhone 15 lineup, and an issue preventing the Weather app widget from showing a snow icon.<br/>
<br/>
Following iOS 17.1.2, Apple is expected to release iOS 17.2, which has been in beta testing for around a month now. The update includes <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ios-17-2-beta-features/">many new features and changes</a>, including Apple's Journal app, support for spatial video recording on iPhone 15 Pro models, a Translate option for the Action button on iPhone 15 Pro models, the ability for Apple Music subscribers to collaborate on playlists, an iMessage Contact Key Verification security option for high-profile individuals, additional Weather and Clock widgets, and more.<div class="linkback">Related Roundups: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/">iOS 17</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-17/">iPadOS 17</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forums: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-17.241">iOS 17</a>, <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-17.242">iPadOS 17</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/27/ios-17-1-2-coming-soon/">iOS 17.1.2 Update for iPhone Likely to Be Released This Week</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-17-1-2-update-for-iphone-likely-to-be-released-this-week.2412148/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's fitness streaming service, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-fitness-plus/">Apple Fitness+</a>, continues to be a strong competitor to Peloton, a well-established service that has become a significant player in the digital fitness space. Both Apple Fitness+ and Peloton offer a range of polished workout routines, delivered by enthusiastic instructors and accompanied by motivating music playlists.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/11/Apple-fitness-plus-feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1407" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-771128" /><br/>
As both subscription services share several similarities, such as offering a variety of workouts that require little to no equipment, it might not be immediately obvious which one is the better choice for individual needs. Our guide aims to answer this question by providing a comprehensive comparison of these two fitness subscription services, taking into account their latest features and pricing.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="peloton_app_tiers">Peloton App Tiers</h2><br/>
Apple Fitness+ is often compared to Peloton because both offer bike and treadmill classes with a comparable digital experience. However, Peloton also sells a range of hardware products that integrate with its digital classes, enhancing the workout experience by connecting with the machine's resistance, cadence, and speed. This integration offers a more seamless experience for workouts on Peloton bikes or treadmills but comes at a higher cost, with equipment prices going up to &#36;4,295, plus the need for a monthly subscription.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/12/peloton-logo.jpeg" alt="" width="2560" height="1934" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-776132" /><br/>
In contrast, Apple Fitness+ does not require any integrated equipment, eliminating initial costs. With the recent restructuring of Peloton's digital offerings into tiered subscriptions – Peloton App Free, Peloton App One, and Peloton App+ – the comparison with Apple Fitness+ becomes more nuanced.<br/>
<br/>
These tiers range from a basic, freemium model offering limited access (Peloton App Free) to a comprehensive, premium subscription (Peloton App+), giving users a broad spectrum of digital workout options without the need for Peloton's physical equipment. This tiered approach positions Peloton's digital offerings as a more direct competitor to Apple Fitness+, catering to a wider range of users with varying needs and preferences.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="comparing_apple_fitness+_and_peloton">Comparing Apple Fitness+ and Peloton</h2><br/>
Apple Fitness+ and Peloton share a number of attributes, such as four types of workout and an equipment-lite emphasis:<br/>
<br/>
<h3 id="similarities">Similarities</h3><br/>
<ul><br/>
 <li>Strength, cycling, treadmill, yoga, and meditation workouts</li><br/>
 <li>Highly-trained, charismatic instructors</li><br/>
 <li>Curated music during workouts</li><br/>
 <li>Equipment-lite workouts, with most requiring no equipment, or just a mat and dumbbells</li><br/>
 <li>Workouts can be downloaded for offline use</li><br/>
 <li>Integration with Apple Watch (to varying degrees)</li><br/>
 <li>Diverse workout library catering to different fitness levels</li><br/>
 <li>Ability to track and monitor workout progress</li><br/>
 <li>Available on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/">iPad</a>, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a></li><br/>
 <li>Both services offer new content updates regularly</li><br/>
</ul><br/>
<br/>
The differences between Apple Fitness+ and Peloton are more pronounced when it comes to additional workouts not offered by the rival service and pricing.<br/>

<br/>
Read on for a closer look at each of these aspects, and see what exactly both fitness subscription services have to offer.<br/>
<br/>
<h3 id="workout_types">Workout Types</h3><br/>
Both services espouse a selection of workouts to appeal to a broad audience, but there are slight differences in what each offers. Apple Fitness+ features 12 workouts:<br/>
<ul><br/>
<li>High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT)</li><br/>
<li>Strength</li><br/>
<li>Yoga</li><br/>
<li>Meditation</li><br/>
<li>Pilates</li><br/>

<li>Core</li><br/>
<li>Cycling</li><br/>
<li>Kickboxing</li><br/>
<li>Treadmill (for running and walking)</li><br/>
<li>Rowing</li><br/>
<li>Mindful Cooldown</li><br/>
</ul><br/>
<br/>
Peloton offers 14 workouts across its app tiers, including:<br/>
<ul><br/>
 <li>Strength</li><br/>
 <li>Yoga</li><br/>
 <li>Cardio</li><br/>
 <li>Meditation</li><br/>

 <li>Rowing (available in higher tiers)</li><br/>
 <li>Barre</li><br/>
 <li>Pilates</li><br/>
 <li>Boxing</li><br/>
</ul><br/>
<br/>
Both Apple Fitness+ and Peloton offer a variety of workouts to cater to different fitness preferences. They share common workout types like strength, cycling, treadmill, yoga, and meditation, yet there are some important distinctions.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/12/peloton-workout-with-weight.jpeg" alt="" width="800" height="533" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-776134" /><br/>
Apple Fitness+ features specific workouts that Peloton lacks such as high-intensity interval training (HIIT), core, dance, pilates, and mindful cooldown. These workouts are clearly categorized, making it easier for users to understand what each session entails. Peloton, with its new tiered app structure, offers a wide range of workouts including cardio, outdoor running, stretching, tread bootcamp, and bike bootcamp, in addition to the common types. While Peloton provides a broad array of choices, it may be less clear in its categorization compared to Apple Fitness+, using terms like "cardio" instead of specific workouts.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/12/apple-fitness-plus-burn-bar.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1137" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-774918" /><br/>
Both services have their unique strengths: Apple Fitness+ with its clear categorization and unique workout types such as dance and HIIT, and Peloton with its more extensive range and integration with equipment. The choice between the two ultimately depends on individual preferences, workout goals, and desired workout experiences.<br/>
<br/>
<h3 id="workout_videos">Workout Videos</h3><br/>
Peloton offers live-streaming classes, creating a dynamic and interactive workout experience. Users can engage in real-time with instructors and other participants, including features like virtual high-fives for encouragement.<br/>
<br/>
Both Apple Fitness+ and Peloton provide the option to download workouts for offline use. This feature is particularly beneficial for users with limited or unreliable internet access, or those who often travel. While Apple Fitness+ focuses on pre-recorded, on-demand content, Peloton combines this with the unique element of live workouts.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/12/fitness-plus-download-offline.jpg" alt="Apple Fitness+ Offline Download" width="2000" height="1967" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-774912" /><br/>
In essence, if real-time interaction and community engagement are important to you, Peloton offers a compelling experience with its live-streaming classes. For those who prioritize flexibility and the convenience of offline access, both Apple Fitness+ and Peloton cater to these needs.<br/>
<br/>
<h3 id="app_access">App Access</h3><br/>
Both Apple Fitness+ and Peloton offer multi-platform access, but with some differences. Apple Fitness+ is available on &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj;, &zwnj;iPad&zwnj;, and &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;, catering to users within the Apple ecosystem. In contrast, Peloton's app, now available in different tiers, extends its reach to a broader audience. It is accessible on Android devices, Fire TV, Roku, and web browsers, in addition to Apple devices.<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/09/fitness-plus.jpg" alt="Apple Fitness+" width="1808" height="1084" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-758955" /><br/>
For Android users or those not deeply integrated into Apple's ecosystem, Peloton offers more versatility with its wider platform support.<br/>
<br/>
<h3 id="integrations">Integrations</h3><br/>
Apple Fitness+ heavily integrates with Apple devices such as the Apple Watch. When a user initiates a Fitness+ workout on their &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;, &zwnj;iPad&zwnj;, or &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj;, their Apple Watch will automatically sync and track that type of workout. Users can also easily pause workouts from their Apple Watch or simply by taking out an AirPod.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/12/apple-fitness-plus-start-workout.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="823" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-774878" /><br/>
One of the biggest highlights of Apple Fitness+ is the ability to see your Apple Watch metrics on-screen in real-time. Users can see their Activity Rings in the top right corner of the screen, while the opposite corner has the elapsed time of the workout, heart rate, and calories burned. Some workouts also feature the "Burn Bar," which is an indicator of how much effort you are putting in compared to other users. Instructors will often highlight and enlarge different metrics as you complete your workout.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/09/applefitnessachievementaward.jpg" alt="" width="1966" height="1420" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-760708" /><br/>
Fitness+ is also integrated with &zwnj;Apple Music&zwnj;, but a subscription is not required to use the service. If you do have an &zwnj;Apple Music&zwnj; subscription, you will be able to easily save tracks you enjoy from workouts. <br/>
<br/>
Peloton has enhanced its Apple Watch integration, allowing users to track Strive Score and close their Activity Rings during workouts. This is available with the Peloton App, Bike, Bike+, Tread, or App. The integration allows for heart rate monitoring and helps users seamlessly log their workouts in the Activity app, contributing to closing their rings.<br/>
<br/>
In addition to the Apple Watch integration, Peloton's own equipment, including the Bike, Bike+, and Tread, provides comprehensive workout metrics and tracking. These devices offer real-time performance data like resistance, cadence, and speed, enhancing the workout experience. Peloton also incorporates basic music features, allowing users to interact with curated playlists during their workouts.<br/>
<br/>
<h3 id="family_use">Family Use</h3><br/>
Peloton, now with its tiered app system, continues to be rated "12+" on the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a> due to "Infrequent/Mild Mature/Suggestive Themes" and "Infrequent/Mild Profanity or Crude Humor." This rating accounts for occasional classes where instructors might use profanity or play explicit music. However, these instances are clearly labeled, allowing users to make informed choices about the content.<br/>
<br/>
Apple Fitness+ maintains its family-friendly approach with music and instructors that generally avoid profanity, making it a suitable option for households with younger members. The service's emphasis on inclusivity and accessibility makes it a preferred choice for families seeking fitness solutions that cater to all ages.<br/>
<br/>
<h3 id="new_content">New Content</h3><br/>
Apple Fitness+ continues to expand its offerings, adding new workouts and content every week, including the recently introduced Artist Spotlight series. Peloton, with its established presence in the fitness industry, boasts a vast content library. The introduction of new app tiers – Peloton App Free, Peloton App One, and Peloton App+ – has further diversified their workout catalog. Peloton frequently updates its library with new classes, including live-streamed sessions, providing a dynamic range of options for subscribers.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/12/peloton-tv-workout-cardio.jpeg" alt="Peloton TV Workout Cardio" width="1000" height="562" /><br/>
<br/>
Both services, Apple Fitness+ and Peloton, offer extensive and regularly updated content, catering to a wide range of fitness interests and levels. While Peloton has a larger historical library, Apple Fitness+ is rapidly growing its collection, making both platforms competitive in their offerings.<br/>
<br/>
In addition to its regular workout updates, Apple Fitness+ launched unique features like "Time to Walk" and "Time to Run." "Time to Walk" is an inspiring audio walking experience on the Apple Watch for Fitness+ subscribers. It features influential people sharing stories, photos, and music, aiming to encourage users to walk more often. Similarly, "Time to Run" is designed to help users become more consistent and better runners through a series of guided runs. These features are updated regularly with new episodes, adding more variety and depth to the Fitness+ content library, and enhancing the user experience beyond traditional workouts.<br/>
<br/>
<h3 id="pricing">Pricing</h3><br/>
Apple Fitness+ remains competitively priced at &#36;9.99 per month or &#36;79.99 annually, offering savings when opting for the annual subscription. It also allows up to six family members to share the subscription at no additional cost.<br/>
<br/>
Peloton, following its recent restructuring, now offers several subscription tiers: Peloton App Free (free), Peloton App One (&#36;12.99/month or &#36;129/year), and Peloton App+ (&#36;24/month or &#36;240/year). The App One and App+ tiers provide more extensive access to classes and features. Peloton's pricing for family use and whether additional profiles are available under each tier have not been specified.<br/>
<br/>
Apple Fitness+ is also part of the &zwnj;Apple One&zwnj; Premier bundle, priced at &#36;29.95 per month, which includes other Apple services like &zwnj;Apple Music&zwnj;, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-arcade/">Apple Arcade</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-news-plus/">Apple News</a>+, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-tv-plus/">Apple TV+</a>. This bundle can offer additional value for users already invested in Apple's ecosystem.<br/>
<br/>
In comparison, Apple Fitness+ generally offers a more cost-effective solution, especially for families or those using multiple Apple services. Peloton's tiered structure provides flexibility but can be more costly, especially for the App+ tier.<br/>
<br/>
<h3 id="free_trials">Free Trials</h3><br/>
Peloton offers a free app tier, Peloton App Free, with a selection of 50 classes across various workout types. This tier allows users to experience Peloton's fitness classes without any cost, making it an accessible option for those new to the service or unsure about committing to a paid subscription. Advanced features like live classes, complete workout tracking, and full access to specialty content are reserved for Peloton's paid tiers.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/12/apple-fitness-plus-3-month-trial.jpeg" alt="" width="1170" height="842" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-774971" /><br/>
<br/>
Peloton provides a 30-day free trial for new users to explore either the App One or App+ membership. This trial includes full access to all classes and features of the chosen tier. Post-trial, users are automatically billed for the monthly membership of the selected tier.<br/>
<br/>
Apple offers a generous free trial for Apple Fitness+. Customers who buy a new Apple Watch or another eligible Apple device can redeem up to three months of Apple Fitness+ for free. <br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="final_thoughts">Final Thoughts</h2><br/>
If you are still weighing your options between Apple Fitness+ and Peloton, it's advisable to take advantage of their free trials. This allows you to try each service, helping you to determine which you prefer.<br/>
<br/>
Apple Fitness+ remains a more budget-friendly option compared to Peloton, especially when considering family use or bundling with other Apple services. While Apple Fitness+ can be used without an Apple Watch, having one enhances the experience significantly. For the majority of users, particularly including beginners and those with a more casual approach to working out, Apple Fitness+'s comparatively low cost and clearer, simpler approach to workouts will be more accessible. <br/>
<br/>
Peloton, with its tiered subscription model, caters to a wider audience, from casual users to serious gym-goers and athletes. Its expanded offerings include live classes and interactive features, making it a strong choice for those seeking a more engaging and professional workout experience with added motivation and social features.<br/>
<br/>
Ultimately, your choice depends on personal preferences, workout styles, the devices you already have, and how you want to integrate these services into your lifestyle. Apple Fitness+ excels in seamless integration within the Apple ecosystem, while Peloton offers a broader platform compatibility and a variety of interactive workout experiences.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/health-and-fitness/">Health and Fitness</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/peloton/">Peloton</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-fitness-plus/">Apple Fitness Plus</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-fitness-vs-peloton/">Apple Fitness+ vs. Peloton Buyer&#039;s Guide</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-fitness-vs-peloton-buyers-guide.2412143/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The debate over whether 8GB of RAM is sufficient for a MacBook Pro has long been a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/08/8gb-ram-m3-macbook-pro-like-16-gb-pc/">topic of contention</a>. The controversy goes back to at least 2012, when Apple launched the first MacBook Pro with Retina display, which started with 8GB of RAM. In 2023, Apple still offers 8GB as the base configuration for its <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/30/apple-announces-m3-macbook-pros/">latest 14-inch MacBook Pro</a>. Coupled with the significant cost of upgrading to higher memory options, Apple's decision has once again sparked discussions about the adequacy and value of this configuration.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/No-13-Inch-M3-MacBook-Pro-Feature-2.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-921296" /><br/>
Of course, Macs have changed a lot over the last decade. For one, Apple no longer relies on Intel processors to power its machines, having developed its own Apple silicon, which is faster and more power efficient. This is because Apple's custom chips use "system-on-a-chip" (SoC) architecture, which integrates several processing cores (CPUs), graphics cores (GPUs), cache memory, and several other components within a single physical package.<br/>
<ul><li><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-silicon-buyers-guide/">Apple Silicon Buyer's Guide: Which Chip Should You Choose?</a></li><br/>
<li><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/14-inch-vs-16-inch-macbook-pro/">Late 2023 MacBook Pro Buyer's Guide: 14-Inch vs 16-Inch Models</a></li></ul><br/>
Apple's M-series of chips also use something called "unified memory," which sits alongside the SoC. Apple's adoption of this high-bandwidth, low-latency memory means the main chip avoids having to communicate data between different memory locations, and it makes the memory pool available for both the CPU and GPU, allowing it to be allocated dynamically depending on the task at hand. <br/>
<br/>
While the overall result of this integrated SoC architecture is better performance and efficiency, the downside is that Apple's unified memory is fixed at the point of purchase and cannot be upgraded at a later date. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/07/M3-chip-series-unified-memory-architecture.jpg" alt="" width="2400" height="1350" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-920050" /><br/>
Opting for more unified memory is not cheap either. For instance, going from the base 8GB of unified memory to 16GB or 24GB costs an extra &#36;200 and &#36;400, respectively. Therefore, it's important when buying a new Mac that you choose the right amount for your individual needs. User opinions on this topic are diverse, with some finding 8GB adequate and others feeling constrained. Ultimately, it comes down to what you want to do on your Mac. Here are the main factors to keep in mind.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="8gb_or_more_ram">8GB or More RAM?</h2><br/>
<ul><li><strong>Daily Tasks and Light Usage</strong>: For basic tasks like web browsing, document editing, and media consumption, 8GB of RAM generally suffices. Modern Macs use features like memory compression and intelligent allocation, which help macOS run smoothly even during multitasking.<br/>
<li><strong>Professional and Creative Workloads</strong>: For more intensive tasks such as video editing, 3D modeling, or software development, 8GB may be limiting, and can cause slower performance and reduced efficiency, as <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/10/8gb-ram-in-m3-macbook-pro-proves-the-bottleneck/">independent tests have shown</a>. This is especially true if you work on advanced projects that require enormous files and content libraries.</li></ul> <br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="wrapping_up">Wrapping Up</h2><br/>
Ultimately, when buying a MacBook Pro, opting for 8GB of unified memory is a cost-effective option if you have light usage requirements, and it offers adequate performance for everyday tasks. However, if you intend to use more demanding applications, it may be worth paying the extra for more memory. This will reduce the risk of the memory acting as a system bottleneck, and allow the Apple silicon in your Mac to perform at its maximum potential. <br/>
<ul><li><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/08/8gb-ram-m3-macbook-pro-like-16-gb-pc/">8GB RAM on M3 MacBook Pro 'Analogous to 16GB' on PCs, Claims Apple</a></li></ul><br/>
Starting at &#36;1,599, Apple's 14-inch M3 MacBook Pro comes with 8GB of unified memory, and choosing 16GB or 24GB costs an extra &#36;200 and &#36;400, respectively. However, bear in mind that after factoring in the extra &#36;200 for 16GB, an M3 Pro model with 18GB and several other extra features is only &#36;200 more at &#36;1,999.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro/">MacBook Pro 14 & 16" </a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Pro_16">14" & 16" MacBook Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macbook-pro.90">MacBook Pro</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/is-8gb-of-ram-enough-for-macbook-pro/">Is 8GB of RAM Enough for MacBook Pro?</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/is-8gb-of-ram-enough-for-macbook-pro.2412140/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>
