		<description><![CDATA[Contrary to recent reports, the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17/">iPhone 17</a> Pro will not feature a horizontal camera layout, according to the leaker known as "<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/instant-digital/">Instant Digital</a>."<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/11/iPhone-17-Pro-Dual-Tone-Feature-1.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-979818" /><br/>
In a new <a href="https://weibo.com/u/5143897135">post on Weibo</a>, the leaker said that a source has confirmed that while the appearance of the back of the &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj; Pro has indeed changed, the layout of the three cameras is "still triangular," rather than the "horizontal bar spread on the internet now." The news contradicts other recent <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/12/iphone-17-pro-redesign-backed-by-supply-chain-info/">supply chain information</a> coming out of China, which claimed "the module is of this elongated oval shape."<br/>
<br/>
The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/">iPhone</a> 11 Pro's "triangular" camera layout was a marked shift from previous models, which featured a more traditional vertical camera layout. Apple's decision to switch to a new design was mainly driven by the need to accommodate a third camera in the form of a new Ultra Wide camera, along with improved sensors and optics. The introduction of the new camera bump set a new aesthetic standard for subsequent models, influencing the design of later releases right up to today's <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/">iPhone 16</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Regardless, it looks like the design of the &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj; Pro is set to change considerably. Late last month, <em>The Information</em>'s Wayne Ma <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/25/first-iphone-17-pro-design-leak/">claimed</a> that the rear of the ‌&zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj;‌ Pro and ‌&zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj;‌ Pro Max will feature a "rectangular camera bump made of aluminum rather than traditional 3D glass," while the bottom half will continue to be made of glass to support wireless charging.<br/>
<br/>
Instant Digital has a mixed <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/instant-digital/">track record for Apple rumors</a>, but has provided some strikingly accurate information, such as the imminent launch of <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/03/iphone-14-new-color-rumor/">2023's Yellow iPhone 14</a>, the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/17/iphone-15-and-15-plus-frosted-glass-rumor/">frosted back glass</a> of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/">iPhone 15</a> and &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; Plus, the Apple Watch Series 9 <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/04/apple-watch-series-9-basically-unchanged/">as a minor refresh</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/04/future-iphone-could-capture-spatial-photos-videos/">spatial video capture</a> on the &zwnj;iPhone 15&zwnj; Pro, the latest <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/">iPad Air</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/">iPad Pro</a>'s <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/08/ipad-air-ipad-pro-landscape-facetime-camera/">landscape front-facing camera</a>, the M4 &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj;'s <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/20/new-ipad-pro-to-gain-matte-option/">nano-texture display option</a>, the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/">iPhone 16 Pro</a>'s <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/02/iphone-16-pro-battery-capacities/">battery capacities</a>, and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/09/apple-may-introduce-redesigned-milanese-loop/">continued Apple Watch band compatibility</a> through the Apple Watch Series 10.

		<description><![CDATA[With iOS 18.2, Apple introduced ChatGPT integration with Apple Intelligence to expand your iPhone's AI capabilities in several ways. When enabled, Siri can leverage ChatGPT for complex queries about photos and documents, and the integration also extends to Writing Tools for text and image generation, while Visual Intelligence helps identify objects and places using your iPhone's camera. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/12/iOS-18.2-ChatGPT-Feature-3-1.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-982614" /><br/>
No ChatGPT account is required to get started, but connecting a free or paid ChatGPT account unlocks additional features and more frequent access to advanced capabilities. This guide explains how to set up and make the most of these new features. Note that you must have an iPhone 15 Pro or iPhone 16 model to use Apple Intelligence features in iOS 18.2.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="setting_up_chatgpt_in_ios_18.2">Setting Up ChatGPT in iOS 18.2</h2><br/>
If you have Apple Intelligence enabled, setting up optional ChatGPT integration requires just a few steps, and you can begin without even having a ChatGPT account. You can always start with the basic setup and upgrade to a connected account later if needed (although you may never need to – more on that below).<br/>
<ol><br/>
 <li>Open <strong>Settings</strong>.</li><br/>
 <li>Tap <strong>Apple Intelligence & Siri</strong>.</li><br/>
 <li>Under "Extensions," tap <strong>ChatGPT</strong>.</li><br/>
 <li>Toggle on the switch next to <strong>Use ChatGPT</strong>.</li><br/>
</ol><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/12/enable-chat-gpt-extension-ios.jpg" alt="settings" width="4170" height="2760" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-982519" /><br/>
<br/>
If you have a ChatGPT account (free or paid), you can optionally <strong>Sign In</strong> from this last screen using your account credentials. One benefit of doing this is that it allows you to retain a history of your chats and return to them later in the ChatGPT app or website. <br/>
<br/>
Remember that you do not need an account to use ChatGPT with Siri – it's completely free, but you may eventually hit OpenAI's daily limits for advanced capabilities, which use the latest GPT-4o model. After reaching these limits, the system switches to basic mode until 24 hours have passed. While it has not been confirmed, basic mode likely uses OpenAI's GPT-4o mini model, which handles most common requests more quickly, but the responses you get may be less detailed. However, in our tests there isn't too much difference between them when used within the context of daily iPhone usage.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/12/confirm-chatgpt-requests.jpg" alt="settings" width="1350" height="459" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-982521" /><br/>
After you've enabled the ChatGPT extension, Siri automatically determines when to use ChatGPT for better responses to your queries. However, you can control whether Siri asks you before sending any information to ChatGPT by toggling the switch next to <strong>Confirm ChatGPT Requests</strong> in the Chat GPT Extension settings menu. Note that Siri always asks permission before sending a file to ChatGPT.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="apple_chatgpt_and_your_privacy">Apple, ChatGPT, and Your Privacy</h2><br/>
<br/>
Apple says that when you use the ChatGPT extension without logging in, only your request and any attachments — like documents or photos — are sent to ChatGPT to process your query. OpenAI doesn't receive any information linked to your Apple Account, and your IP address remains hidden. Only your general location is shared. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/08/Apple-Privacy-Yellow.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="630" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-810859" /><br/>
OpenAI does not store your queries or their responses, and your data won't be used to enhance or train their models. Only if you choose to sign in will your ChatGPT account settings and OpenAI's data privacy policies apply. <br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="siri_integration">Siri Integration</h2><br/>
<br/>
The combination of Siri and ChatGPT easily enhances the voice assistant's capabilities compared to what you will be used to. The integration works well for complex queries involving problem solving, writing assistance, detailed explanations, and step-by-step instructions. You'll find that responses are more detailed and context-aware compared to standard Siri capabilities.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/11/ios-18-2-chatgpt-siri-integration-question.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-980097" /><br/>
Siri‌ will analyze each request to see if it's something that needs to be answered by ChatGPT, but you can specify that you want to use ChatGPT simply by starting a Siri query with "ChatGPT." This actually opens up a lot more of the integration's utility. For example, you can ask ChatGPT to generate an image based on a prompt, and it will use Dall-E to do the heavy lifting. Even better, the results are generally superior to Apple's Image Playground. You can save the resulting image using the Save button in the top-right corner of the output card. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/12/chatgpt-messages.jpeg" alt="messages" width="5386" height="3030" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-982524" /><br/>
Pro Tip: If you query ChatGPT in Messages and ask it to generate an image, it will even drop the image into the text field, ready for it to be shared in the conversation.<br/>
<br/>
You can also ask ChatGPT a question about something on your screen, and Siri will offer to send a screenshot of it to ChatGPT or the full content as a file if it's a long document. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/12/send-screen-content-chatgpt.jpg" alt="notes" width="2760" height="2760" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-982525" /><br/>
You can use the <strong>Copy</strong> button at the top-right of the scrollable response window to copy the output to your clipboard. <br/>
<br/>
Alternatively, you can save useful responses by invoking Siri and saying "Save this to my notes," which gives you a searchable archive of your conversations in Notes that persists after they end. This is especially useful if you aren't logged into ChatGPT and can't refer back to your account to see your chat history. <br/>
<br/>

ChatGPT can be used with ‌Siri‌, but it is also integrated into Writing Tools and Visual Intelligence. With Writing Tools, ChatGPT can generate text, and with ‌Visual Intelligence‌, ChatGPT can answer questions about what the Camera sees. We'll look at these specific integrations in what follows.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="chatgpt_and_writing_tools">ChatGPT and Writing Tools</h2><br/>
<br/>
With the advent of ChatGPT integration in iOS 18.2, Writing Tools has gained a new Compose option. This lets you describe what you'd like to write, and ChatGPT will create it for you.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/12/compose-with-chat-gpt.jpg" alt="writing tools" width="4170" height="2760" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-982537" /><br/>
But the Compose option doesn't just limit you to text prompts. If you look in the text input field, there is a + button. Tapping this brings up options to upload a file or image on your iPhone to ChatGPT for the chat bot to reference as part of your query. When a response has been generated, you will also see further suggested queries from ChatGPT in the Compose panel. <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/12/compose-using-file-reference-chatgpt.jpg" alt="compose-messages" width="2760" height="2760" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-982538" /><br/>
The Compose feature isn't limited to generating text from files or images stored on your iPhone. If you are in Notes, for example, you can select text that you want ChatGPT to work with, or you can ask it to reference all the text in a note. You'll also see these options in a tappable menu above the Compose input field.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/12/select-text-chatgpt.jpeg" alt="notes" width="1350" height="1581" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-982623" /><br/>
ChatGPT's Compose option can be used pretty much anywhere on your iPhone where you can access Writing Tools, such as Notes, Messages, and Safari, as well as third-party apps that support the Apple Intelligence feature set.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="chatgpt_and_visual_intelligence">ChatGPT and Visual Intelligence</h2><br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/12/Visual-Intelligence-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-982216" /><br/>
‌Visual Intelligence‌ is an iPhone 16 feature that uses the Camera Control button located on the lower right side of the device. If you long press it, you can get into ‌Visual Intelligence‌ mode, where the Camera app can be used to identify what's around you.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/12/visual-intelligence.jpg" alt="camera" width="2760" height="2760" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-982625" /><br/>
For example, if you point the camera at an object or take a picture of it, you can tap the <strong>Ask</strong> button, and ChatGPT will analyse what is in the viewfinder to identify the object. If the output doesn't answer your query, you can follow it up by typing into the ChatGPT input field. This can be useful for getting more information about pretty much anything around your home or when you're out and about.<br/>
<br/>
<h2 id="future_chat_bot_extensions_for_ios">Future Chat Bot Extensions for iOS</h2><br/>
There have been reports about future Apple Intelligence integrations with AI chatbots like Google's Gemini and Anthropic's Claude, although no official announcements have been made yet. That said, Apple software chief Craig Federighi stated in June that he would like to see Gemini integration happen at some point.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/google-gemini.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-941761" /><br/>
According to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-11-03/apple-finally-finds-its-game-console-rival-with-the-new-m4-and-m4-pro-mac-minis-m31na57p"><em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman</a>, Apple may delay integrating Google Gemini until next year to give OpenAI an exclusivity window, particularly since Apple isn't paying for the technology. However, it's unclear whether Gemini's arrival will coincide with an iOS 18 update in the spring or if it will feature as part of the iOS 19 release cycle later next year.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ios-18-2-iphone-chatgpt-integration/">iOS 18.2: Everything You Can Do With ChatGPT Integration</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-18-2-everything-you-can-do-with-chatgpt-integration.2445670/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/24/apple-maps-now-available-on-the-web/">web version of Apple Maps</a> that Apple first debuted in July has been upgraded with support for Look Around, the feature that is essentially equivalent to Google Street View.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/12/apple-maps-web-look-around.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-982617" /><br/>
In supported areas, Look Around provides a high-resolution ground level view of restaurants, retail locations, landmarks, streets, and other points of interest. It's a feature that has long been available on iOS devices, but support in the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-maps/">Apple Maps</a> app for the web allows non-Apple users to experience the feature.<br/>
<br/>
Apple appears to have implemented support earlier this month, around December 11, according to <a href="https://www.threads.net/@thatchriscarley/post/DDr9K6EvlAU?xmt=AQGzTz07QJuoPfMtGLctjKg9kmbfoTRR345Nyxx_s48nWg">Chris Carley</a> (via <em><a href="https://9to5mac.com/2024/12/17/apple-maps-web-look-around/">9to5Mac</a></em>). Look Around is available in multiple cities in the United States, along with countries like Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Hong Kong, New Zealand, Portugal, Spain, Singapore, London, and more. A full list is <a href="https://www.apple.com/ios/feature-availability/#maps-look-around">available on Apple's website</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Back in August, there were signs suggesting that Apple is working on a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/12/apple-planning-to-expand-look-around/">major Look Around expansion</a>, bringing it to more rural areas and to new countries like Morocco, Egypt, Jordan, Syria, Lebanon, China, Belarus, Turkey, Bulgaria, Mexico, and Slovakia, but that expansion has not yet happened.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="https://beta.maps.apple.com/">Apple Maps on the web</a> works like the &zwnj;Apple Maps&zwnj; app, allowing users to get driving and walking directions, find places to visit, view ratings and hours, and browse curated Guides. There are built-in features for ordering food from the Maps place card and discovering places to eat, shop, and explore in cities around the world.<br/>
<br/>
The web version of &zwnj;Apple Maps&zwnj; is available as an alternative to Google Maps, and it is compatible with Safari, Chrome, Edge, and Firefox, on Macs, iPads, and Windows PCs. &zwnj;Apple Maps&zwnj; on the web continues to be available in a beta capacity.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-maps/">Apple Maps</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/17/apple-maps-web-look-around/">Apple Maps on the Web Gains &#039;Look Around&#039; Support</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-maps-on-the-web-gains-look-around-support.2445662/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The 14-inch <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro/">MacBook Pro</a> is Apple's only Mac that can be purchased with an M4 chip, M4 Pro chip, or M4 Max chip, so is the M4 powerful enough or is it better to get the M4 Pro or M4 Max? That's the question we explore in our <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m4-macbook-pro/">M4 MacBook Pro</a> review.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><iframe width="1659" height="835" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/anIVewgtbFc" title="The Base M4 MacBook Pro is All You Need (Skip M4 Pro &amp; Max)" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/macrumors?sub_confirmation=1">Subscribe to the MacRumors YouTube channel</a> for more videos.</em></div><br/>
Built on a 3-nanometer process, even the base M4 chip is more than enough for everyday tasks like web browsing, checking mail, writing, and watching videos. It's also more than sufficient for video editing, 3D rendering, photo editing, and other creative tasks.<br/>
<br/>
Full time creative professionals who need to get a lot done in a short amount of time are going to benefit from the more powerful M4 Pro and M4 Max chips, as these can cut precious minutes off of rendering times.<br/>
<br/>
Next year, you'll be able to get the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/">MacBook Air</a> with an M4 chip too, but right now, the &zwnj;M4 MacBook Pro&zwnj; is the best machine in terms of price, value, and portability. The 14-inch model is more convenient for travel than the 16-inch model, but one must-have travel upgrade is the nano-texture display. If you're ever planning to use your &zwnj;MacBook Pro&zwnj; outside, it really cuts down on glare, and it's ideal for bright rooms, too.<br/>
<br/>
The minimum RAM is now 16GB, which goes a long way toward making the base &zwnj;M4 MacBook Pro&zwnj; the best value you can get. 16GB is totally adequate for <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/">Apple Intelligence</a> and video and photo editing tasks. You could bump it up for future proofing purposes, but if you need more RAM for your day-to-day tasks right now, it may be worth getting the M4 Pro or M4 Max instead because those machines come with 24GB and 32GB minimum RAM, respectively.<br/>
<br/>
Storage is a consideration too. The base &zwnj;M4 MacBook Pro&zwnj; comes with a 512GB SSD, which may be too little storage for some users. Bumping up to 1TB could be worth it if you don't want to have to rely on an external SSD, but you're basically going to be paying more for storage regardless of whether you choose the M4, M4 Pro, or M4 Max. The M4 Pro models also start with 512GB of storage, while the M4 Max models start with 1TB.<br/>
<br/>
For an on-the-go machine, the base &zwnj;M4 MacBook Pro&zwnj; is likely to be an excellent machine for most users, and when the M4 &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; models come out, those will be ideal for most people even over the &zwnj;MacBook Pro&zwnj;. If the &zwnj;MacBook Pro&zwnj; is your sole machine and it's used for intensive tasks like video editing and 3D rendering, it could be worth checking out the M4 Pro and M4 Max chip options, but a lot of people won't need anything beyond the M4.<br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/17/m4-macbook-pro-review/">Video: M4 MacBook Pro Review</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/video-m4-macbook-pro-review.2445655/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[More than four years have passed since Apple released the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod-mini/">HomePod mini</a> in November 2020, and the wait for a new model might finally soon be over.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/11/homepod-mini-thumb-feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-770560" /><br/>
Below, we recap rumors about the next-generation HomePod mini.<br/>
<br/>
<em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman last week reported that a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/12/apple-tv-homepod-mini-2025-launch/">new HomePod mini will be released next year</a>. He said the speaker will be equipped with Apple's own combined Wi-Fi and Bluetooth chip, which <strong>supports Wi-Fi 6E</strong>. It is unclear if the chip's Wi-Fi 6E support will be enabled for the new HomePod mini, but if it is, that would allow for faster wireless connectivity compared to the current model's Wi-Fi 4 support. <br/>
<br/>
While there are no other rumors yet, likely upgrades for the next HomePod mini include a <strong>newer "S" chip, improved sound quality, a second-generation Ultra Wideband chip</strong> for a lower-latency Handoff experience, and <strong>new color options</strong>. The current HomePod mini is equipped with the S5 chip, which debuted in 2019's Apple Watch Series 5.<br/>
<br/>
In addition to a new HomePod mini, Apple reportedly plans to release an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-command-center/">all-new smart home hub</a> as soon as March next year. The hub is expected to feature around a 6-inch display that can be mounted on a wall, or attached to a tabletop base with a speaker, so the device could be similar to the HomePod mini in some ways.<br/>
<br/>
It is unclear if the next HomePod mini will have Siri improvements, as unlike the home hub, the speaker is not expected to get Apple Intelligence.<br/>
<br/>

		<description><![CDATA[The current Apple TV 4K was released more than two years ago, so the streaming device is becoming due for a hardware upgrade soon. Fortunately, it was recently rumored that a new Apple TV will launch at some point next year.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/10/apple-tv-4k-yellow-bg-feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-870258" /><br/>
Below, we recap rumors about the next-generation Apple TV.<br/>
<br/>
<em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman last week reported that Apple has been working on its own combined Wi-Fi and Bluetooth chip that will roll out in multiple devices next year, including <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/12/apple-tv-homepod-mini-2025-launch/">new Apple TV and HomePod mini models</a>. He said the chip will <strong>support Wi-Fi 6E</strong>, which would be an upgrade over the current Apple TV's standard Wi-Fi 6 support. Wi-Fi 6E extends the capabilities of Wi-Fi 6 to the 6 GHz band, enabling faster wireless speeds and reduced signal interference with a compatible device and router. <br/>
<br/>
No major design changes have been rumored for the next Apple TV specifically, but Gurman said Apple has considered <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/07/apple-tv-with-camera-again-rumored/">adding a <strong>built-in camera</strong></a> to a future model. tvOS 17 <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/use-iphone-facetime-camera-apple-tv/">added a FaceTime app to the Apple TV</a>, allowing for users to have video calls by using the rear camera on a connected iPhone or iPad. If the Apple TV gained a built-in camera, users would no longer need to rely on an external device for video calls on the TV.<br/>
<br/>
Unsurprisingly, the next Apple TV is also expected to be equipped with a <strong>newer chip for faster performance</strong>. The current Apple TV is equipped with the A15 Bionic chip that debuted in the iPhone 13 models in 2021. Apple has released several newer A-series chips since then, including the A16 Bionic, A17 Pro, A18, and A18 Pro.<br/>
<br/>
The next Apple TV could have <strong>lower pricing</strong>. Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo suggested that the next model <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/10/18/kuo-even-cheaper-apple-tv/">could have a sub-&#36;100 starting price</a>. In the U.S., the current Apple TV is available with 64GB or 128GB of storage for &#36;129 and &#36;149, respectively.<br/>
<br/>
It is unclear exactly when in 2025 the new Apple TV would launch. Here is when the previous five Apple TV models were announced:<br/>
<br/>
<ul><li><strong>Third-generation Apple TV 4K:</strong> October 2022</li><br/>
<li><strong>Second-generation Apple TV 4K:</strong> April 2021</li><br/>
<li><strong>First-generation Apple TV 4K:</strong> September 2017</li><br/>
<li><strong>Apple TV HD:</strong> September 2015</li><br/>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple today <a href="https://www.apple.com/br/newsroom/2024/12/sleep-apnea-notifications-available-today-on-apple-watch/">announced</a> that the Apple Watch feature to help identify sleep apnea is now available in Brazil following the granting of a license from the Brazilian Health Regulatory Agency.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/sleep-apnea-detection-apple-watch.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-965154" /><br/>
The feature, which is now available in <a href="https://www.apple.com/watchos/feature-availability/#health-sleep-apnea-notifications">over 150 countries and regions</a>, uses the Apple Watch's accelerometer to record wrist movements associated with interruptions in normal breathing patterns during sleep.<br/>
<br/>
Based on the data collected, the feature assesses each day whether your levels of breathing disturbances are elevated or not elevated, and if over a 30-day period it determines the frequency of your elevated disturbances reaches a threshold, you will receive a notification of possible sleep apnea. The notification is not a diagnosis, but it does provide information to help you discuss the situation with a healthcare provider.<br/>
<br/>
The algorithm uses machine learning trained on clinically validated sleep data, with Apple's feature then validated in its own <a href="https://www.apple.com/health/pdf/sleep-apnea/Sleep_Apnea_Notifications_on_Apple_Watch_September_2024.pdf">clinical study</a>, which found that 100 percent of study participants who received a positive result from the algorithm indeed had at least mild sleep apnea.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch/">Apple Watch 10</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch">Apple Watch (Buy Now)</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/17/apple-watch-sleep-apnea-brazil/">Apple Watch Sleep Apnea Notifications Now Available in Brazil</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-watch-sleep-apnea-notifications-now-available-in-brazil.2445636/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple on Monday seeded the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/16/apple-seeds-first-macos-sequoia-15-3-beta/">first tvOS 18.3 beta</a> to developers for testing. The update will likely be released in January. So far, there are only minor changes for the Apple TV, with one new feature and a few code changes discovered.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/Apple-TV-4K-hero-221018-feature.jpg" alt="" width="2322" height="1306" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-918420" /><br/>
Below, we outline what is new in tvOS 18.3 so far.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Robot Vacuum Support in Home App</h2><br/>
First, tvOS 18.3 will add robot vacuum support to the Home app on the Apple TV, based on code-level references to the feature in the first beta.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/Roomba-and-HomeKit-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-955897" /><br/>
Here is how Apple describes the feature, which has faced a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/02/apple-homekit-robot-vacuum-support-2025/">delayed launch</a>:<blockquote>The Home app now supports the core functionality of robot vacuum cleaners, such as power control, cleaning mode, vacuum, mop, and charge status. They can also participate in automations and scenes, and respond to Siri requests. So you can add them to your cleaning routines — or tell Siri to do some spot cleaning in the living room.</blockquote>Likewise, the iOS 18.3 beta will add robot vacuum support to the Home app on the iPhone.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Code Changes</h2><br/>
<h3>Additional Screen Savers Removed</h3><br/>
The recently-released <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/11/apple-releases-tvos-18-2/">tvOS 18.2 update</a> for the Apple TV added a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/18/tvos-18-2-snoopy-screen-savers/">rotating Snoopy screen saver</a> to 2021 and newer models, but it appears that other new screen savers that Apple planned for the device have either been canceled or postponed.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/11/Apple-TV-Plus-Foundation.jpg" alt="" width="1120" height="630" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-980243" /><br/>
Apple was <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/05/new-apple-tv-screen-savers-coming-soon/">planning at least two additional screen saver categories</a> for the Apple TV. The first was a "TV and Movies" category of screen savers based on content from Apple TV+ series and movies, and the second was a "Soundscapes" category of screen savers overlaid with relaxing background sounds, including water and nature sounds.<br/>
<br/>
<em>MacRumors</em> contributor <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/author/aaron-perris/">Aaron Perris</a> has confirmed that hidden references to the "TV and Movies" and "Soundscapes" screen saver categories that were in tvOS 18.2 code are no longer present in the first tvOS 18.3 beta's code.<br/>
<br/>
Last month, it was reported that Apple removed all references to the "TV and Movies" screen savers <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/28/no-movie-screen-savers-for-apple-tv/">from its Apple TV page</a>, including a preview of a new screen saver based on the Apple TV+ series "Foundation." With references to the screen savers removed in the tvOS 18.3 beta, there is now even more evidence they are canceled or postponed.<br/>
<br/>
In addition to Snoopy, existing screen saver categories on the Apple TV include Aerials, Memories, and a Portraits option with an on-screen clock.<br/>
<br/>
<h3>Digital Sales Notice</h3><br/>
<br/>
The following digital sales notice will be visible in the Apple TV app, according to tvOS 18.3 code:<blockquote>When you purchase access to this item, you can permanently download it to your iPhone, iPad, Mac, or PC. Once downloaded, you can access this without an internet connection, and Apple can't remove it from your device. If you purchase this from the Apple TV app on Apple TV, smart TVs, or other streaming devices, you can't download it on those devices, but you can easily download it on compatible devices.</blockquote>tvOS 18 updates are compatible with all 2015 and newer Apple TV models, but some features and capabilities require a newer model.<div class="linkback">Related Roundup: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a></div><div class="linkback">Buyer's Guide: <a href="https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_TV">Apple TV (Don't Buy)</a></div><div class="linkback">Related Forum: <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-tv-and-home-theater.100">Apple TV and Home Theater</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/17/whats-new-in-tvos-18-3-so-far/">Here is Everything New for the Apple TV in the tvOS 18.3 Update So Far</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/here-is-everything-new-for-the-apple-tv-in-the-tvos-18-3-update-so-far.2445621/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<title>Apple Hit With Criminal Complaints Over Congo Mineral Trade</title>

		<description><![CDATA[Apple's subsidiaries in France and Belgium have had criminal complaints filed against them by the Democratic Republic of Congo, which is accusing the tech giant of using conflict minerals in its product supply chain (via <em><a href="https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/society-equity/congo-files-criminal-complaints-against-apple-europe-over-conflict-minerals-2024-12-17/">Reuters</a></em>). <br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/Apple-Logo-Spotlight.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-912758" /><br/>
The complaints allege that Apple is complicit in handling stolen goods and laundering minerals obtained through armed conflicts in the region.<br/>
<br/>
Congo, a major source of tin, tantalum, and tungsten (3T minerals) used in computers and mobile phones, claims that Apple uses minerals pillaged from Congo and laundered through international supply chains. The complaints specifically target Apple France, Apple Retail France, and Apple Retail Belgium, accusing them of covering up war crimes and engaging in deceptive commercial practices. France and Belgium were reportedly chosen because of their perceived strong emphasis on corporate accountability.<br/>
<br/>
Apple claims that it does not directly source primary minerals and conducts regular supplier audits. In its <a href="https://s203.q4cdn.com/367071867/files/doc_downloads/2024/04/Apple-Conflict-Minerals-Report.pdf">2023 SEC filing</a>, the company stated that none of its 3T mineral or gold suppliers had financed or benefited armed groups in Congo or neighboring countries.<br/>
<br/>
The complaints focus on ITSCI, a metals industry-funded monitoring scheme designed to help companies perform due diligence on mineral suppliers. Congo's lawyers argue that Apple uses ITSCI as a "fig leaf" to falsely present its supply chain as clean, despite the scheme being suspended by the Responsible Minerals Initiative (RMI), of which Apple is a member.<br/>
<br/>
Competition for minerals has been a significant driver of conflict in Congo's eastern mining regions since the 1990s, resulting in widespread civilian casualties and displacement. Armed groups often sustain themselves through mineral exports that are frequently smuggled through neighboring countries.<br/>
<br/>
The judicial authorities in France and Belgium will now decide whether to investigate the complaints further and bring criminal charges.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/congo/">Congo</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/lawsuit/">Apple Lawsuits</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/17/apple-facing-criminal-complaints-congo-minerals/">Apple Hit With Criminal Complaints Over Congo Mineral Trade</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-hit-with-criminal-complaints-over-congo-mineral-trade.2445618/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

The issue stems from a "Resource Busy" error that occurs during the final stages of the backup process when attempting to copy system preboot or recovery files. While similar errors in the past could be resolved by keeping the system awake during backup, Ninian reports that this new bug appears to be more fundamental.<br/>
<br/>
The problem originates from Apple's earlier decision to restrict third-party apps from directly copying the operating system, instead requiring them to use Apple's own replication tools. With these tools now malfunctioning in macOS 15.2, SuperDuper and potentially other backup utilities are unable to create complete bootable backups.<br/>
<br/>
As a temporary workaround, SuperDuper users can still back up their applications, data, and settings using the app's "Backup - all files" option with "Smart Update" enabled. However, this method won't create a bootable backup that can be used for immediate system recovery.<br/>
<br/>
Shirt Pocket has filed a bug report with Apple and is awaiting a resolution, but Nanian is keen to emphasize that since the issue lies within Apple's system components, third-party developers cannot implement their own fixes.<br/>
<br/>
The timing of this bug is particularly concerning for users who rely on bootable backups as part of their data protection strategy, especially given the recent release of macOS 15.2 and the potential for other undiscovered issues.

		<description><![CDATA[Meta today <a href="https://www.meta.com/blog/quest/ray-ban-meta-v11-software-update-live-ai-translation-shazam/">added new features</a> to its Ray-Ban smart glasses, including live translation and live AI. With live AI, the Meta smart glasses are able to see whatever the wearer sees thanks to the built-in camera, and can hold real-time conversations.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/10/meta-ray-bans.jpg" alt="" width="1724" height="970" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-968917" /><br/>
According to Meta, the glasses are able to provide hands-free help with meal prep, gardening, exploring a new neighborhood, and more. Questions can be asked without the need to say the "Hey Meta" wake word, and the AI can understand context between requests for referencing prior queries. Meta says that eventually, the AI will be able to "give useful suggestions before you even ask."<br/>
<br/>
Along with live AI, there's now a new live translation feature that can translate in real-time between English and either Spanish, French, or Italian. When someone is speaking in one of those three languages, the glasses will translate what they say into English through the speakers or on a connected smart phone, and vice versa.<br/>
<br/>
The Meta glasses are now able to use Shazam to identify songs, so if you ask "Hey Meta, what is this song?" Shazam can provide the song title. Shazam is an Apple-owned company now, and is heavily integrated into iOS.<br/>
<br/>
All of these features are <a href="https://www.meta.com/smart-glasses/early-access-program/">part of the Early Access Program</a> open to any Meta glasses wearer. Sign-ups are available on Meta's website, though there are a limited number of slots for customers in the United States and Canada.<br/>
<br/>
Meta's smart glasses have seen a good amount of consumer interest, and rumors suggest that Apple might be getting into the smart glasses market with a similar device. Back in October, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/14/apple-smart-glasses-airpods-cameras-2027/"><em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman said</a> that Apple is considering a pair of smart glasses that are comparable to the Meta Ray-Bans, offering <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/">Siri</a> support, integrated cameras, and more.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/meta/">Meta</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/16/meta-smart-glasses-live-ai/">Meta&#039;s Smart Glasses Gain Live AI and Live Translation</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/metas-smart-glasses-gain-live-ai-and-live-translation.2445595/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The dedicated ChatGPT search engine that OpenAI developed is rolling out to all users starting today, <a href="https://openai.com/12-days/?day=8">OpenAI announced</a> as part of its 12 days of OpenAI event.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/10/chatgpt-search-engine.jpg" alt="" width="3840" height="2160" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-974574" /><br/>
SearchGPT was added to ChatGPT in late October, providing improved AI-based searches right from the ChatGPT app and web interface. According to OpenAI, SearchGPT is able to search the web in a "much better way than before," providing links to relevant web sources along with contextual information and support for follow-up questions.<br/>
<br/>
When it first debuted, SearchGPT was limited to those who subscribed to ChatGPT Plus and ChatGPT Teams, but it will now also be coming to free users.<br/>
<br/>
During today's announcement, OpenAI said that its AI search has been improved over the last few months, making it faster and better on mobile. There's also a new option to search as you converse with ChatGPT, and to make ChatGPT Search the default engine for browsers like Chrome.<br/>
<br/>
OpenAI is bringing search to logged in ChatGPT users, so it will be available globally on all platforms that support ChatGPT.<div class="linkback">Tags: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/chatgpt/">ChatGPT</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/openai/">OpenAI</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/16/searchgpt-available-to-all-users/">SearchGPT Rolling Out to All OpenAI Users Starting Today</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/searchgpt-rolling-out-to-all-openai-users-starting-today.2445589/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Social network TikTok today asked the U.S. Supreme Court to temporarily halt an imminent ban as TikTok waits for the appeal process to play out. TikTok is set to be banned from U.S. app stores <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/06/tiktok-appeal-rejected-january-ban-on-track/">starting on January 19</a> because parent company ByteDance did not sell TikTok to a non-Chinese company as <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/08/tiktok-sues-us-government/">mandated by a bill</a> in April.<br/>
<br/>
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-752609" src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/08/tiktok-logo.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" /><br/>
<br/>
TikTok is calling on the Supreme Court to hear its appeal, and it is sticking with the free speech argument that the lower appeals court denied. The petition that TikTok submitted to the Supreme Court claims that Congress has "enacted a massive and unprecedented speech restriction," and that TikTok is one of the "most popular and important venues for communication" in the U.S.<br/>
<br/>
U.S. lawmakers gave ByteDance nine months to sell TikTok to a company not located in China, but ByteDance has maintained that doing so would be impossible. ByteDance says that it is not able to give the TikTok source code to a new owner because it would take years for engineers to become familiar enough with it to perform routine maintenance, and ByteDance also does not plan to allow a third-party company to access its TikTok algorithm.<br/>
<br/>
<div class="center-wrap"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Statement on Filing Application for Emergency Injunction Pending Appeal with the Supreme Court:<br><br>&quot;&quot;The Supreme Court has an established record of upholding Americans’ right to free speech. Today, we are asking the Court to do what it has traditionally done in free speech cases:…</p>&mdash; TikTok Policy (@TikTokPolicy) <a href="https://twitter.com/TikTokPolicy/status/1868754443703140757?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 16, 2024</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div><br/>
Further, China has said that it will firmly oppose any sale of the TikTok app, and any sale would need to be approved by the Chinese government. Per the terms of the bill, if TikTok is not sold off, app store owners Google, Apple, and others will be required to stop distributing the app in January. If TikTok is ultimately banned, users who have downloaded the app already would be able to continue to use it so long as it stayed functional, but there would be no distribution method for getting the app in the United States.<br/>
<br/>
U.S. lawmakers want TikTok sold to a company outside of China over concerns that the Chinese government could force ByteDance to hand over information from users in the United States, plus there have been suggestions that China could use TikTok to spread political propaganda.<br/>
<br/>
It is possible that the ban on TikTok could be lifted or delayed by President-elect Donald Trump. <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/12/16/tiktok-asks-supreme-court-to-block-us-ban-pending-appeal.html">According to <em>CNBC</em></a>, Trump told reporters on Monday that his administration will "take a look at TikTok." Trump tried to ban TikTok when he was in office, but said this year that he opposes the law that Congress passed.<div class="linkback">Tag: <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tiktok/">TikTok</a></div><br/>This article, &quot;<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/16/tiktok-asks-us-supreme-court-ban-delay/">TikTok Asks U.S. Supreme Court to Temporarily Block Upcoming January Ban</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href="https://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors.com</a><br/><br/><a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/tiktok-asks-u-s-supreme-court-to-temporarily-block-upcoming-january-ban.2445587/">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br/><br/>]]></description>

<br/>
<img src="https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/12/macOS-Sequoia-Genmoji-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="1406" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-982419" /><br/>
With &zwnj;Genmoji&zwnj;, Mac users can input a text prompt to create a custom character that behaves just like an emoji on devices running iOS 18.1, iPadOS 18.1, &zwnj;macOS Sequoia&zwnj; 15.1 and later. On earlier versions of iOS, iPadOS, and macOS, and on Android devices, &zwnj;Genmoji&zwnj; show up as an image. <br/>
<br/>
&zwnj;Genmoji&zwnj; can be added from the emoji palette on the keyboard, which can be activated with the Control + Command + Space keyboard shortcut in an app like Notes or by clicking on the emoji icon in Messages. <br/>
<br/>
&zwnj;Genmoji&zwnj; is an <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/">Apple Intelligence</a> feature that is available on all Macs that have an Apple silicon chip.
