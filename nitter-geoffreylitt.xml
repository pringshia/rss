what I want in a future OS: provide guarantees that certain actions will be reviewed by a human. AI automations will go speculate but we&apos;ll need to confirm.</title>

        <title>A puzzler:

I want to automate a monthly payment that I do manually in my bank website.

Would be a simple thing for a web UI automation. But how can I trust that to be reliable? I donâ€™t want a robot clicking the wrong buttons on my bank. 

Whatâ€™s state of the art here?</title>
