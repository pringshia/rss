        <title>Whoa, just had an incredible moment with AI generating debug tools on the fly...

Was pair programming w/ @qualmist and we were struggling to interpret textual output from a CLI tool.

So we had Claude build us a visual debugger, and it totally crushed it üòé 

quick backstory:

So we were playing around w/ synctex, a tool that maps locations in Latex files to locations in an output PDF.

Pretty simple, you can ask it &quot;line 5 in the .tex file, where&apos;s that in the pdf&quot; and it&apos;ll spit out a bunch of numbers representing coordinates for boxes in the PDF:

h:133.768372
v:275.285675
W:343.711060
H:9.065993

Hm, it&apos;s hard to *see* what those numbers actually mean on the pdf! we were doing coordinate math, manually measuring cursor positions... yuck. felt like we needed a more visual workflow.

Enter Claude! Asked it to make a React app that actually *draws* the boxes as overlays on top of the PDF.

You just paste in the CLI output and upload an image of the PDF. it parses the output and draws red boxes in the correct positions on the image.

This is so much faster than manually parsing the CLI output!! allowed us to quickly try some experiments and get a better feel for how synctex works in various cases.

Generating the tool took a few iterations and the AI wasn&apos;t perfect, but honestly it made very few mistakes and was totally good enough to keep us in flow of conversation. I was repeatedly impressed by 3.5 Sonnet getting things right that it feels like GPT-4 would have failed at a year ago, e.g. coordinate math stuff.

@simonw says &quot;AI-enhanced development makes me more ambitious with my projects&quot;. This is exactly that philosophy at play. No way I would have tried to code this debugger manually during a pairing session. But AI lowered the cost enough to try it.

A strange reflection about this process: when you&apos;re building debugger tools with AI, there&apos;s a lot of leverage because there&apos;s 2 compounding layers of acceleration:

1) AI makes it faster to iterate on debug tools...
2) ...and debug tools make it faster to iterate on your project!

As a live programming nerd this idea gets me tremendously excited. Until now, it&apos;s generally been too expensive for devs to build bespoke visualization tools in the flow of coding their projects. But when that cost comes down, and it&apos;s faster to build custom tools, then it feels possible to accelerate work in a meaningful way.

So yeah, I guess I&apos;d summarize the lesson here as: AI-enhanced development makes me more ambitious with my debuggers...</title>

        <title>Excited to be working on a new project this summer at &gt;@inkandswitch together with @qualmist and @paulsonnentag! Here&apos;s a quick summary of what we&apos;re up to:

# Jacquard: version control + provenance for empirical research

How do researchers write papers that contain data analysis and charts?

Consider a hypothetical astronomy paper. Measurements are collected from a telescope and written into a raw data file, which is reduced into a smaller CSV, which is loaded into a Python analysis notebook, which outputs further intermediate data files, as well as several visualizations as PNGs, which are then dragged into a web-based collaborative LaTeX editor where the team edits the paper and refines the charts.

This cobbling-together of tools and intermediate data files can cause serious problems for teams of researchers:

- &quot;How did we generate this chart?&quot;: Researchers waste time remembering what script and data were used to generate a given chart or data table. And when an analysis gets updated, it&apos;s tricky to remember what other steps need to be manually rerun to correctly update downstream results.
- &quot;Where&apos;d that file go?&quot;: The text, the figures, and the code for the paper are spread across various web apps and devices. Any collaborator can edit the paper text on the web, but the moment they want to edit a chart, they have to email their collaborator who has the code on their laptop. Sometimes the team even loses track of a file entirely.
-  &quot;What&apos;s changed recently?&quot; Authors risk missing important changes made by their collaborators. It&apos;s generally challenging to suggest or review changes; many &quot;track changes&quot; views present too much detail and are difficult to parse.

Through conversations with researchers in fields ranging from astrophysics to oceanography, we&apos;ve learned that these kinds of problems cause daily friction, stealing focus from important work and even causing mistakes. Some researchers use software engineering tools like Git and Makefiles to help with these problems, but those tools are an awkward fit for exploratory research programming, and aren&apos;t easily accessible to scientists who are less familiar with the command line.

---

On this project, we&apos;re prototyping Jacquard: a collaborative environment for writing empirical research papers. The goal is to free up researchers to focus more on their core work of science and communication, and less on tedious bookkeeping. (The name &quot;Jacquard&quot; comes from the automated loom that was an important step in the history of computing.)

Jacquard builds on years of work at Ink &amp; Switch, including most recently Patchwork (http://inkandswitch.com/patchwork/notebook/): a browser-based local-first collaboration environment with powerful version control utilities like branching and history views.

We&apos;re starting out by extending Patchwork to support the kinds of data needed by empirical research papers, like LaTeX files and data visualization scripts.

From there, we aim to add on powerful capabilities like tracking provenance of derived artifacts or making suggestions on a branch. Throughout this process, the prototype should remain a simple web-based collaboration interface that&apos;s accessible to researchers who don&apos;t have prior experience with version control or build systems.

A couple notes about our process:

First, while we&apos;re aiming to invent new collaboration workflows, supporting real science work requires integrating with existing tools as well. So we&apos;ll be taking a pragmatic approach that meets scientists where they are, building bridges to existing desktop workflows and programs.

Second, while this work is related to efforts in scientific reproducibility, that&apos;s not our top priority. Reproducibility efforts often focus on packaging up results once they&apos;re completed; we&apos;re more interested in supporting and accelerating the messy process of getting to the results in the first place.

üóûÔ∏è We&apos;ll be posting updates as we go, see links in next post below!

        <title>R to @geoffreylitt: so i think a better approach for many domains -- esp for amateurs who aren&apos;t all-in -- is:

have fun, go end-to-end thru the task, make stuff...

and then when the fire of motivation is lit, get serious and enjoy the deliberate practice</title>

        <title>it&apos;s kinda funny how improving at a skill often bottlenecks on improving a sub-skill that appears totally fringe and secondary

eg: to improve at home cooking, get better at cleaning / managing workflow, rather than knife skills / seasoning</title>
