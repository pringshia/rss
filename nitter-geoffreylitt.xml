        <title>R to @geoffreylitt: The key is that you can get very detailed with your prompt since voice makes it so fast. Just say everything you’d say to a junior, be verbose. 

Feels less like “computer magically doing coding for me” and more like “saving myself some typing”, still a huge accelerator.</title>
