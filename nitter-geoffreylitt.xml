        <title># Ephemeral software with shared data

An intriguing possibility: what if people using AI to build personal software tools leads to a next generation data architecture without cloud app silos?

A diagram of how that might happen:

Breaking down each level:

Level 1: &quot;just UI&quot;.
Starting super simple. We can use AI to generate a UI -- no storage, no backend, no multiplayer.

This describes a lot of the incredible Artifacts / Websim examples flying around right now, as well as many of my past experiments building software tools w/ AI. It&apos;s straightforward to run and deploy a web app that&apos;s &quot;just UI&quot;.

These tools can be very useful for quick tasks‚Äîesp if the UI supports import + export w/ copy-paste or file download. But obviously there are UX limits if you can&apos;t save data or collaborate.

Level 2: &quot;Siloed apps&quot;
If you add data storage + collaboration to the stack for your generated tools, then you can make true &quot;apps&quot; with deeper functionality.

This approach seems less common at the moment -- likely because it&apos;s more complexity for the AI model to manage, and also more work to deploy / operate. But it seems likely grow to over time.

All the existing contenders in the &quot;simpler multiplayer apps&quot; space have something to offer here in terms of cutting down complexity --backend platforms like Replit, no-code tools like Glide and Retool, local-first sync libraries like Automerge...and indeed many of those players are doing very neat stuff.

Still, there&apos;s a problem: each app is a silo; each app stores its own data. This is totally normal and is what we&apos;re used to in cloud apps. But, it cuts off a key use case: making new ephemeral tools for your existing data! (APIs are nice but often aren&apos;t powerful enough to truly make new tools)

Which brings us to...

Level 3: &quot;shared data&quot;
Imagine that all our apps were just UIs on top of a shared collaboration and data storage stack -- analogous to the role the filesystem used to play as a shared data layer for all your desktop apps, but reimagined for modern collaboration...

Now: imagine you&apos;re hitting limits with a tool you&apos;re using. What if you could just generate or customize your own alternative tool on the fly, with AI assistance? Perhaps you just add a specialized button that handles one workflow, perhaps you replace the original tool entirely...

The key is that you&apos;re not starting from scratch with fresh app and no data, you&apos;re just tweaking and extending the tools you already had.

This shared data layer thing is not a new idea at all, but so far we&apos;ve remained largely stuck in the equilibrium of cloud app silos. Which makes sense -- it&apos;s a hard equilibrium to escape! Privacy / security is (very) tricky for shared data between apps. What&apos;s the billing model if not cloud SaaS? And where does this shared data layer live and what can it do?

But... I wonder if the energy around AI-generated ephemeral tools will finally be the push that can nudge us towards this different future. Here&apos;s the bet: if AI dramatically lowers the cost of UI creation, that incentivizes open environments with shared data, where custom tools can be more valuable.

(Sidenote, this is why we pursue malleable software and local-first software together at Ink &amp; Switch, there are strong resonances... will likely share some more demos on this line of reasoning soon üòé)

Would be curious to hear reactions / counterarguments to this view!</title>
