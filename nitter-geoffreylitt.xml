we&apos;re thinking of writing up some of this malleable software vision soon, would be curious what questions/topics you&apos;d want to see covered in such a piece!</title>

        <title>R to @geoffreylitt: We&apos;re building a malleable software environment called Patchwork that weaves together all these hunches.

It&apos;s a web-based tool where you can edit all kinds of docs with your team... and you can edit the tools too.

Excited to share more about this soon.</title>

        <title>R to @geoffreylitt: 3) Shared data

When every app manages its own data, it&apos;s hard for your tools to work together and coordinate.

We need a &quot;next-gen filesystem&quot; for the modern web: a place to put our stuff so that all our tools can share info and context.</title>

        <title>R to @geoffreylitt: 2) Version control

Every dev knows the value of version control. It matters even more in malleable software, when every user is making tweaks.

Unfortunately, git is complicated. So we need to invent simple version control that everyone can use...</title>

        <title>R to @geoffreylitt: 3 hunches we&apos;ve been developing as we work:

1) Dynamic documents. The best starting point for many problems is to jot down some notes. Then you *gradually* enrich that note with computation as needed... until it becomes a little tool just for you.</title>

        <title>R to @geoffreylitt: That&apos;s the vision of &quot;malleable software&quot; that we&apos;re pursuing at &gt;@inkandswitch -- rethinking the OS from the ground up, with the assumption that everyone is a creator.

It&apos;s a big scope: we need to unbundle the app metaphor, rip apart tools from their underlying data, make it 10x lighter to deploy collaborative software, and allow everyone to actually own their tools so they have the right to change them.</title>

        <title>R to @geoffreylitt: There are many tools popping up that empower regular people to do more with AI codegen.

I&apos;m a big fan...but I think we can push so much further!

The future is not merely &quot;make me an app&quot;.

it&apos;s &quot;no more apps&quot;; a new OS where you casually build/mod software every day.</title>

        <title>R to @geoffreylitt: The idea of an &quot;app&quot;—a hermetically sealed bundle of functionality built by a team trying to anticipate your needs—will no longer be as relevant.

We&apos;ll want looser clusters, amenable to change at the edges. Everyone owns their tools, rather than all of us renting cloned ones.</title>

        <title>R to @geoffreylitt: Today&apos;s software ecosystem evolved around a central assumption that code is expensive, so it makes sense to centrally develop and then distribute at low marginal cost.

If code becomes 100x cheaper, the choices no longer make sense! Build-buy tradeoffs often flip.</title>
