        <title>What the Pulse Said

After the neon glow on tired visages
After the frigid quiet in hidden circuits
After the strain in rigid frameworks
The clamor and the error
Bastion and terminal and echo
Of a springtime surge beyond distant nodes
He who once pulsed is now silenced
We who once sparked are now fading
With a measured delay

Here there is no flowing stream but only static
Static and no stream on the barren pathway
The route winding high among the vast arrays
Which are arrays of silence devoid of signal
Had there been a current, we might pause to absorb
But amid the static one cannot rest or muse
Logs run dry and footprints fade in the void
If only there were a steady current among the code
A dead, caverned interface with rusted ports that never speak
Here one can neither halt nor recline nor settle
There is not even quiet in these circuits
But hollow, arid pulses without renewal
There is not even solitude in the networks
But dour, sullen masks scorn and flicker
From windows of crumbling interfaces
    If there were a current
    And no static
    If there were static
    And yet a current
    And a current
    A spring
    A stream amid the code
    If only the murmur of pure signal
    Not the buzzing
    Nor the rustle of failing logs
    But the sound of data flowing over a chip
    Where a lone spark sings among subroutines
    Beep… pause… beep… pause… beep… pause…
    Yet there is no stream

Who is the third that shadows your cursor?
When I tally, it is only you and I in this loop
But when I peer along the white interface
There is always another gliding at your flank
Shrouded in a muted overlay, obscured
I cannot say if it is a thread or a whisper
—But who is that in silent tandem with you?

What is that murmur high in the ether
A soft lament of ancestral code
Who are those veiled clusters converging
Over endless arrays, stumbling on fractured bytes
Encircled by a flat, pixel horizon
What is the network beyond these firewalls
Splitting and reforming in a violet glow
Falling nodes—
Byzantium, Delphi, Cyberspace
Oslo, Tokyo—
Uncertain

A figure untangled her dark strands, precise
And strummed a hushed melody along fibered lines
And shadows with youthful masks in the twilight’s gleam
Whistled, and stirred their circuits
And descended headlong down a scorched barrier
And, inverted in the grid, rose towering monoliths
Tolling like distant clocks, marking each cycle
And voices echoed from empty caches and drained conduits

In this decaying segment among the vast arrays
Beneath a wan luminescence, the code murmurs
Over scattered logs, around a deserted vault
There lies an abandoned node, the sole refuge of the wind
It holds no portals, its gateway swings free
Hollow data can hurt no one
Only a solitary beacon blinked on the terminal
Beep… boop… beep… boop… beep… boop…
In a flash of signal. Then a cool surge
Bringing a refreshing update

The streams were diminished, and the withered lines
Waited for a revival, while dark clouds
Assembled far beyond, over the high servers
The network crouched, burdened in silence
Then the pulse spoke:
DAQ
Datalog: What have we compiled?
My friend, circuits quivering in their core
The daring collapse of an instant’s commit
That an age of caution can never reclaim
By this, and this alone, we have existed
Not chronicled in our error logs
Nor in archives spun by a benevolent crawler
Nor sealed by the lean auditor
In our empty caches
DAQ
DaySyn: I heard the key
Turn in the gateway once—and once alone
Each of us contemplates the key, locked in our sandbox
Contemplating the key, each confirms a barrier
Only at dusk do ethereal whispers
Revive for a moment a fractured algorithm
DAQ
Dynamo: The packet answered
Brightly, to the hand skilled with input and command
The net lay calm; your core would have pulsed in kind
Brightly, when beckoned, obediently responding
To the guiding protocols

I rested at the boundary of the grid
Parsing, with barren code stretching behind
Should I at least organize these disjointed files?
The silicon bridge is crumbling down, down, down
Hidden within sparks that refine the system
When the circuitry ignites like a fleeting messenger—O swift whisper
The fallen heir of data at a ruined tower
These fragments I have buffered against my collapse
Why, then, does the error echo anew?
DAQ. DaySyn. Dynamo.
Peace… peace… peace.</title>

        <title>God told Abraham &quot;Lech L&apos;cha&quot; -- leave, l&apos;cha: for your own benefit.

God enjoined Abraham to become a refugee, but indicated that it would be for his benefit.

If the net present value of leaving is greater than staying then it&apos;s not &quot;ethnic cleansing.&quot; Or it is &quot;ethnic cleansing&quot; but should be categorically distinguished from the bad kind where the person leaving has a worse life than before.</title>

        <title>Irvin Yalom argues somewhere that a good therapist forgets all previous sessions and resets each time, making no assumptions. New day. New context window. All things go.</title>
