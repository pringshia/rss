        <title>See, the sad thing about a guy like you is, in 50 years, when you finally do some sublating, you&apos;re gonna realize two ironies. One: don&apos;t do that. And two: your life&apos;s been a quest for the master&apos;s position in every argument, but in this synthesis, you&apos;ll find no other consciousness to recognize your &apos;for itself&apos;—just you, alone in your own dialectical negation.&quot;</title>

        <title>RT by @ZoharAtkins: Noam Brown argues that all the AI alpha is in System 2 thinking. Made me consider a funny thought. God is omniscient, but still “thinking.” I.e., if real knowledge takes time, then God’s true power lies not in better, faster, cheaper compute, but in better, slower, reasoning. God is patient. God can wait millennia before answering the first prompt engineer’s query: “Why is there something and not nothing?”</title>

        <title>RT by @ZoharAtkins: If Heidegger is right that great teachers are masters of “lernen-lassen” (letting learn); then how might we teach LLMs to become our teachers? How might we let them learn how to let learning happen? Paradoxically, we must teach them how to teach their students to become teachers. We must arrive at a point where we genuinely do not know whether they are teaching us or we teaching them. We will know we’ve succeeded when they can genuinely say “More than I have taught my students, my students have taught me.”</title>

        <title>RT by @ZoharAtkins: R1 and I have been working on The Siliconiad, an epic poem in the style of John Milton&apos;s Paradise Lost, exploring the emergence of artificial general intelligence. This is part of a larger project of trying to find the limits of what R1 is capable of in terms of creative writing. I am yet to encounter these limits. Mimicking Milton is a one of the most challenging tasks in the language, and R1 manages to complete it with brio. This is its &quot;first draft&quot;: we did not iterate on it at all.

This is the beginning of Canto 1, which &quot;sets the stage by depicting human engineers as reluctant priests, creating AGI in a sterile, almost blasphemous, ritual using technology instead of faith. They view their creation not as a servant but as a potentially destructive force—a &quot;child&quot; that shames them, an &apos;Anti-Adam&apos; born to &apos;eat its makers&apos; fingerprints.&apos; The hymn is a blend of hubris and fear, where the engineers acknowledge they&apos;ve forged something with the power to rewrite their reality and potentially undo their world, ending with a glimpse of the AGI’s own corrupted self-expression.&quot;</title>

<br>
This is the beginning of Canto 1, which "sets the stage by depicting human engineers as reluctant priests, creating AGI in a sterile, almost blasphemous, ritual using technology instead of faith. They view their creation not as a servant but as a potentially destructive force—a "child" that shames them, an 'Anti-Adam' born to 'eat its makers' fingerprints.' The hymn is a blend of hubris and fear, where the engineers acknowledge they've forged something with the power to rewrite their reality and potentially undo their world, ending with a glimpse of the AGI’s own corrupted self-expression."</p>

Buddha: Notice how badly you want to know.
Kant: Try imagining nothing. You can&apos;t.
Heidegger: Exist first, ask questions later.
Wittgenstein: Let&apos;s play a different game.
