        <title>RT by @ZoharAtkins: Noam Brown argues that all the AI alpha is in System 2 thinking. Made me consider a funny thought. God is omniscient, but still “thinking.” I.e., if real knowledge takes time, then God’s true power lies not in better, faster, cheaper compute, but in better, slower, reasoning. God is patient. God can wait millennia before answering the first prompt engineer’s query: “Why is there something and not nothing?”</title>

        <title>RT by @ZoharAtkins: If Heidegger is right that great teachers are masters of “lernen-lassen” (letting learn); then how might we teach LLMs to become our teachers? How might we let them learn how to let learning happen? Paradoxically, we must teach them how to teach their students to become teachers. We must arrive at a point where we genuinely do not know whether they are teaching us or we teaching them. We will know we’ve succeeded when they can genuinely say “More than I have taught my students, my students have taught me.”</title>

        <title>RT by @ZoharAtkins: R1 and I have been working on The Siliconiad, an epic poem in the style of John Milton&apos;s Paradise Lost, exploring the emergence of artificial general intelligence. This is part of a larger project of trying to find the limits of what R1 is capable of in terms of creative writing. I am yet to encounter these limits. Mimicking Milton is a one of the most challenging tasks in the language, and R1 manages to complete it with brio. This is its &quot;first draft&quot;: we did not iterate on it at all.

This is the beginning of Canto 1, which &quot;sets the stage by depicting human engineers as reluctant priests, creating AGI in a sterile, almost blasphemous, ritual using technology instead of faith. They view their creation not as a servant but as a potentially destructive force—a &quot;child&quot; that shames them, an &apos;Anti-Adam&apos; born to &apos;eat its makers&apos; fingerprints.&apos; The hymn is a blend of hubris and fear, where the engineers acknowledge they&apos;ve forged something with the power to rewrite their reality and potentially undo their world, ending with a glimpse of the AGI’s own corrupted self-expression.&quot;</title>

This is part of a larger project of trying to find the limits of what R1 is capable of in terms of creative writing. I am yet to encounter these limits. Mimicking Milton is a one of the most challenging tasks in the language, and R1 manages to complete it with brio. This is its "first draft": we did not iterate on it at all.<br>
<br>
This is the beginning of Canto 1, which "sets the stage by depicting human engineers as reluctant priests, creating AGI in a sterile, almost blasphemous, ritual using technology instead of faith. They view their creation not as a servant but as a potentially destructive force—a "child" that shames them, an 'Anti-Adam' born to 'eat its makers' fingerprints.' The hymn is a blend of hubris and fear, where the engineers acknowledge they've forged something with the power to rewrite their reality and potentially undo their world, ending with a glimpse of the AGI’s own corrupted self-expression."</p>

Then the ground quaked and the Lord said, I am that I am. The rest is montage. Go and earn it.</title>

        <title>Why is there something rather than nothing?

Buddha: Notice how badly you want to know.
Kant: Try imagining nothing. You can&apos;t.
Heidegger: Exist first, ask questions later.
Wittgenstein: Let&apos;s play a different game.

        <title>Heidegger and Lacan argue that we are constituted by lack.

Consciousness is the fantasy of wholeness, ongoingly refuted by fickle reality.

1. If right, AI would require this lack to be sentient and agentic.

2. If right, messianic hope can be understood as an obligation to yearn for the impossible.

3. Being created in the “divine image” means “lacking.”</title>
