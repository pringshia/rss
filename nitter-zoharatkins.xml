        <title>You know what brings history to life?

Telling the story of the Exodus in such a way that it is as if you yourself left Egypt.

Everything else will go the way of oblivion.</title>

        <title>RT by @ZoharAtkins: I’m looking forward to reading this. I believe there are strong reasons to believe in a transcendent loving Creator. The world is imo too aesthetically profound not to have an artist behind it. But I’d also not that believing and being religious are too distinct things. It wasn’t until Maimonides that belief became a mitzvah, formally. To be religious is not about believing in propositions but being committed to a way of life. As Kierkegaard quipped about Anselm—seeking to prove God’s existence is like a lover trying to prove the existence of his beloved while in the midst of an embrace. Why not just feel the love? One rejoinder is that belief exists for those who doubt; it is the habit of absence, a commitment in the face of distance.</title>

        <title>Why is Torah study as great as all other commandments combined?

• Rambam: it enables right action.
• Vilna Gaon: It elevates the soul.
• Baal Shem Tov: It connects to God.
• Rav Chaim: It shapes character.
• Ramchal: It reveals hidden truths.</title>
