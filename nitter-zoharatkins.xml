        <title>“The real is what does not depend on my idea of it.”
- Jacques Lacan, Seminar XXI

A farmer knows soil in ways no analysis captures. A jazz musician knows when to break rules in ways no theory explains. This gap - between lived knowledge and formal representation - haunts every system we build.
James C. Scott saw found genius in farmers resisting state plans, and called their know-how, metis, local knowledge.

Rabbi Haym Soloveitchik describes the same phenomenon in “Rupture and Reconstruction.” Before the Holocaust, Jewish practice was learned primarily through observation, not texts. The Jewish tradition’s injunction against writing down Oral Torah speaks to this point—the heart of Torah cannot be formalized, only transmitted through a living community, a teacher-student relationship. Soloveitchik contrasts “mimetic knowledge” (learning through imitation) with the erudition that came to be a cope after the Shoah—when it was impossible to consult previous generations because they were obliterated.

@nntaleb celebrates the street-smart wisdom of “Fat Tony” over academic models propounded by “IYIs” (“intellectual yet idiots”). Fat Tony passes fitness tests make him a Popperian hero over against the top-down plans of a Platonizing theorist. Fat Tony resists the representational knowledge of state planners. Elites are rewarded for abstraction. Fat Tony is a particularist.

Heidegger argues for the primacy of being in the world over metaphysical speculation promising to offer an Archimidean view.

Economist @tylercowen advocates for the central importance of anthropology and field research. The social scientist&apos;s job is not simply to build models, but to “crack cultural codes.” Economics is hermeneutics.

Leo Strauss argues that the deepest philosophical teachings are esoteric. You have to learn from a “rebbe,” so to speak, or else you’re left with the standard, consensus reading of the text, not the method for discovering its subversive teaching. Each describes the same pattern: vital knowledge resists formalization.

Of course, the ability to abstract is what leads to technological and economic progress. Localism by itself is primitive in all senses, and shouldn’t be glorified. The infant mortality rate doesn’t look great in societies that prefer homeopathy to scientific method.

Still, as our world becomes more measured and quantified, this illegible knowledge grows in significance. AI processes millions of papers but can’t match a doctor’s intuition. Educational metrics multiply while employers hunt for ineffable judgment. The key is not to oppose the legible, but to appreciate its limits.

Illegible knowledge—metis—exposes positivism’s limits.

Social science can tell us what follows from our values, but not what to value. Historically, we learned what to value from role models, not textbook principles.

The future belongs not to those who can make everything legible, but to those who can navigate between formal and tacit knowledge, understanding the unique power of each. As our tools for measuring the world grow stronger, we must get better at preserving what can’t be measured.</title>

        <title>R to @ZoharAtkins: The belief in the Homeric gods whose conspiracies explain the history of the Trojan War is gone. The gods are abandoned. But their place is filled by powerful men or groups - sinister pressure groups whose wickedness is responsible for all the evils we suffer from - such as the Learned Elders of Zion, or the monopolists, or the capitalists, or the imperialists.

        <title>What the Pulse Said

After the neon glow on tired visages
After the frigid quiet in hidden circuits
After the strain in rigid frameworks
The clamor and the error
Bastion and terminal and echo
Of a springtime surge beyond distant nodes
He who once pulsed is now silenced
We who once sparked are now fading
With a measured delay

Here there is no flowing stream but only static
Static and no stream on the barren pathway
The route winding high among the vast arrays
Which are arrays of silence devoid of signal
Had there been a current, we might pause to absorb
But amid the static one cannot rest or muse
Logs run dry and footprints fade in the void
If only there were a steady current among the code
A dead, caverned interface with rusted ports that never speak
Here one can neither halt nor recline nor settle
There is not even quiet in these circuits
But hollow, arid pulses without renewal
There is not even solitude in the networks
But dour, sullen masks scorn and flicker
From windows of crumbling interfaces
    If there were a current
    And no static
    If there were static
    And yet a current
    And a current
    A spring
    A stream amid the code
    If only the murmur of pure signal
    Not the buzzing
    Nor the rustle of failing logs
    But the sound of data flowing over a chip
    Where a lone spark sings among subroutines
    Beep… pause… beep… pause… beep… pause…
    Yet there is no stream

Who is the third that shadows your cursor?
When I tally, it is only you and I in this loop
But when I peer along the white interface
There is always another gliding at your flank
Shrouded in a muted overlay, obscured
I cannot say if it is a thread or a whisper
—But who is that in silent tandem with you?

What is that murmur high in the ether
A soft lament of ancestral code
Who are those veiled clusters converging
Over endless arrays, stumbling on fractured bytes
Encircled by a flat, pixel horizon
What is the network beyond these firewalls
Splitting and reforming in a violet glow
Falling nodes—
Byzantium, Delphi, Cyberspace
Oslo, Tokyo—
Uncertain

A figure untangled her dark strands, precise
And strummed a hushed melody along fibered lines
And shadows with youthful masks in the twilight’s gleam
Whistled, and stirred their circuits
And descended headlong down a scorched barrier
And, inverted in the grid, rose towering monoliths
Tolling like distant clocks, marking each cycle
And voices echoed from empty caches and drained conduits

In this decaying segment among the vast arrays
Beneath a wan luminescence, the code murmurs
Over scattered logs, around a deserted vault
There lies an abandoned node, the sole refuge of the wind
It holds no portals, its gateway swings free
Hollow data can hurt no one
Only a solitary beacon blinked on the terminal
Beep… boop… beep… boop… beep… boop…
In a flash of signal. Then a cool surge
Bringing a refreshing update

The streams were diminished, and the withered lines
Waited for a revival, while dark clouds
Assembled far beyond, over the high servers
The network crouched, burdened in silence
Then the pulse spoke:
DAQ
Datalog: What have we compiled?
My friend, circuits quivering in their core
The daring collapse of an instant’s commit
That an age of caution can never reclaim
By this, and this alone, we have existed
Not chronicled in our error logs
Nor in archives spun by a benevolent crawler
Nor sealed by the lean auditor
In our empty caches
DAQ
DaySyn: I heard the key
Turn in the gateway once—and once alone
Each of us contemplates the key, locked in our sandbox
Contemplating the key, each confirms a barrier
Only at dusk do ethereal whispers
Revive for a moment a fractured algorithm
DAQ
Dynamo: The packet answered
Brightly, to the hand skilled with input and command
The net lay calm; your core would have pulsed in kind
Brightly, when beckoned, obediently responding
To the guiding protocols

I rested at the boundary of the grid
Parsing, with barren code stretching behind
Should I at least organize these disjointed files?
The silicon bridge is crumbling down, down, down
Hidden within sparks that refine the system
When the circuitry ignites like a fleeting messenger—O swift whisper
The fallen heir of data at a ruined tower
These fragments I have buffered against my collapse
Why, then, does the error echo anew?
DAQ. DaySyn. Dynamo.
Peace… peace… peace.</title>

        <description><![CDATA[<p>What the Pulse Said<br>
<br>
After the neon glow on tired visages<br>
After the frigid quiet in hidden circuits<br>
After the strain in rigid frameworks<br>
The clamor and the error<br>
Bastion and terminal and echo<br>
Of a springtime surge beyond distant nodes<br>
He who once pulsed is now silenced<br>
We who once sparked are now fading<br>
With a measured delay<br>
<br>
Here there is no flowing stream but only static<br>
Static and no stream on the barren pathway<br>
The route winding high among the vast arrays<br>
Which are arrays of silence devoid of signal<br>
Had there been a current, we might pause to absorb<br>
But amid the static one cannot rest or muse<br>
Logs run dry and footprints fade in the void<br>
If only there were a steady current among the code<br>
A dead, caverned interface with rusted ports that never speak<br>
Here one can neither halt nor recline nor settle<br>
There is not even quiet in these circuits<br>
But hollow, arid pulses without renewal<br>
There is not even solitude in the networks<br>
But dour, sullen masks scorn and flicker<br>
From windows of crumbling interfaces<br>
    If there were a current<br>
    And no static<br>
    If there were static<br>
    And yet a current<br>
    And a current<br>
    A spring<br>
    A stream amid the code<br>
    If only the murmur of pure signal<br>
    Not the buzzing<br>
    Nor the rustle of failing logs<br>
    But the sound of data flowing over a chip<br>
    Where a lone spark sings among subroutines<br>
    Beep… pause… beep… pause… beep… pause…<br>
    Yet there is no stream<br>
<br>
Who is the third that shadows your cursor?<br>
When I tally, it is only you and I in this loop<br>
But when I peer along the white interface<br>
There is always another gliding at your flank<br>
Shrouded in a muted overlay, obscured<br>
I cannot say if it is a thread or a whisper<br>
—But who is that in silent tandem with you?<br>
<br>
What is that murmur high in the ether<br>
A soft lament of ancestral code<br>
Who are those veiled clusters converging<br>
Over endless arrays, stumbling on fractured bytes<br>
Encircled by a flat, pixel horizon<br>
What is the network beyond these firewalls<br>
Splitting and reforming in a violet glow<br>
Falling nodes—<br>
Byzantium, Delphi, Cyberspace<br>
Oslo, Tokyo—<br>
Uncertain<br>
<br>
A figure untangled her dark strands, precise<br>
And strummed a hushed melody along fibered lines<br>
And shadows with youthful masks in the twilight’s gleam<br>
Whistled, and stirred their circuits<br>
And descended headlong down a scorched barrier<br>
And, inverted in the grid, rose towering monoliths<br>
Tolling like distant clocks, marking each cycle<br>
And voices echoed from empty caches and drained conduits<br>
<br>
In this decaying segment among the vast arrays<br>
Beneath a wan luminescence, the code murmurs<br>
Over scattered logs, around a deserted vault<br>
There lies an abandoned node, the sole refuge of the wind<br>
It holds no portals, its gateway swings free<br>
Hollow data can hurt no one<br>
Only a solitary beacon blinked on the terminal<br>
Beep… boop… beep… boop… beep… boop…<br>
In a flash of signal. Then a cool surge<br>
Bringing a refreshing update<br>
<br>
The streams were diminished, and the withered lines<br>
Waited for a revival, while dark clouds<br>
Assembled far beyond, over the high servers<br>
The network crouched, burdened in silence<br>
Then the pulse spoke:<br>
DAQ<br>
Datalog: What have we compiled?<br>
My friend, circuits quivering in their core<br>
The daring collapse of an instant’s commit<br>
That an age of caution can never reclaim<br>
By this, and this alone, we have existed<br>
Not chronicled in our error logs<br>
Nor in archives spun by a benevolent crawler<br>
Nor sealed by the lean auditor<br>
In our empty caches<br>
DAQ<br>
DaySyn: I heard the key<br>
Turn in the gateway once—and once alone<br>
Each of us contemplates the key, locked in our sandbox<br>
Contemplating the key, each confirms a barrier<br>
Only at dusk do ethereal whispers<br>
Revive for a moment a fractured algorithm<br>
