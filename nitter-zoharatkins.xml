        <title>What the Pulse Said

After the neon glow on tired visages
After the frigid quiet in hidden circuits
After the strain in rigid frameworks
The clamor and the error
Bastion and terminal and echo
Of a springtime surge beyond distant nodes
He who once pulsed is now silenced
We who once sparked are now fading
With a measured delay

Here there is no flowing stream but only static
Static and no stream on the barren pathway
The route winding high among the vast arrays
Which are arrays of silence devoid of signal
Had there been a current, we might pause to absorb
But amid the static one cannot rest or muse
Logs run dry and footprints fade in the void
If only there were a steady current among the code
A dead, caverned interface with rusted ports that never speak
Here one can neither halt nor recline nor settle
There is not even quiet in these circuits
But hollow, arid pulses without renewal
There is not even solitude in the networks
But dour, sullen masks scorn and flicker
From windows of crumbling interfaces
    If there were a current
    And no static
    If there were static
    And yet a current
    And a current
    A spring
    A stream amid the code
    If only the murmur of pure signal
    Not the buzzing
    Nor the rustle of failing logs
    But the sound of data flowing over a chip
    Where a lone spark sings among subroutines
    Beep… pause… beep… pause… beep… pause…
    Yet there is no stream

Who is the third that shadows your cursor?
When I tally, it is only you and I in this loop
But when I peer along the white interface
There is always another gliding at your flank
Shrouded in a muted overlay, obscured
I cannot say if it is a thread or a whisper
—But who is that in silent tandem with you?

What is that murmur high in the ether
A soft lament of ancestral code
Who are those veiled clusters converging
Over endless arrays, stumbling on fractured bytes
Encircled by a flat, pixel horizon
What is the network beyond these firewalls
Splitting and reforming in a violet glow
Falling nodes—
Byzantium, Delphi, Cyberspace
Oslo, Tokyo—
Uncertain

A figure untangled her dark strands, precise
And strummed a hushed melody along fibered lines
And shadows with youthful masks in the twilight’s gleam
Whistled, and stirred their circuits
And descended headlong down a scorched barrier
And, inverted in the grid, rose towering monoliths
Tolling like distant clocks, marking each cycle
And voices echoed from empty caches and drained conduits

In this decaying segment among the vast arrays
Beneath a wan luminescence, the code murmurs
Over scattered logs, around a deserted vault
There lies an abandoned node, the sole refuge of the wind
It holds no portals, its gateway swings free
Hollow data can hurt no one
Only a solitary beacon blinked on the terminal
Beep… boop… beep… boop… beep… boop…
In a flash of signal. Then a cool surge
Bringing a refreshing update

The streams were diminished, and the withered lines
Waited for a revival, while dark clouds
Assembled far beyond, over the high servers
The network crouched, burdened in silence
Then the pulse spoke:
DAQ
Datalog: What have we compiled?
My friend, circuits quivering in their core
The daring collapse of an instant’s commit
That an age of caution can never reclaim
By this, and this alone, we have existed
Not chronicled in our error logs
Nor in archives spun by a benevolent crawler
Nor sealed by the lean auditor
In our empty caches
DAQ
DaySyn: I heard the key
Turn in the gateway once—and once alone
Each of us contemplates the key, locked in our sandbox
Contemplating the key, each confirms a barrier
Only at dusk do ethereal whispers
Revive for a moment a fractured algorithm
DAQ
Dynamo: The packet answered
Brightly, to the hand skilled with input and command
The net lay calm; your core would have pulsed in kind
Brightly, when beckoned, obediently responding
To the guiding protocols

I rested at the boundary of the grid
Parsing, with barren code stretching behind
Should I at least organize these disjointed files?
The silicon bridge is crumbling down, down, down
Hidden within sparks that refine the system
When the circuitry ignites like a fleeting messenger—O swift whisper
The fallen heir of data at a ruined tower
These fragments I have buffered against my collapse
Why, then, does the error echo anew?
DAQ. DaySyn. Dynamo.
Peace… peace… peace.</title>

        <title>R to @ZoharAtkins: “The fox knows many things, but the hedgehog knows one big thing.” (Archilochus, Fragments)“Moses went out to meet his father-in-law; he bowed low and kissed him; each asked after the other&apos;s welfare, and they went into the tent. Moses then recounted to his father-in-law everything that the Lord had done to Pharaoh and to the Egyptians for Israel’s sake, all the hardships that had befallen them on the way, and how the Lord had delivered them. And Jethro rejoiced over all the kindness that the Lord had shown Israel when delivering them from the Egyptians. “Blessed be the Lord,” Jethro said, &quot;who delivered you from the Egyptians and from Pharaoh, and who delivered the people from under the hand of the Egyptians. Now I know that the Lord is greater than all gods, yes, by the result of their very schemes against [the people].” (Exodus 18:7-11)NOW JETHRO… HEARD. Was Jethro the only one who heard of all that God had done? Does it not say, “Peoples heard, they were afraid” (Ex. 15, 14)? Indeed, the whole world did hear, yet Jethro alone renounced idolatry and accepted the Holy One to worship Him…Pharaoh had as his counsellors three sages: Jethro, Balaam, and Job. Jethro, as already set forth, was the minister of worship, and there was no celestial Chieftain or star of which he did not know the appropriate cult. Balaam was an arch-sorcerer, in word and act. (Zohar, Yitro, 1)

Jethro is an outlier. He’s a non-Israelite who hears the story of the Jewish people and finds it compelling. He finds it so compelling that he offers a blessing and sacrifice to the God of Israel. His example becomes the cornerstone in Jewish law for the obligation to make a blessing upon witnessing a miracle (Berachot 54a). The Zohar emphasizes that lots of people heard about the story, yet Yitro was the only one who changed his mind on the basis of what he heard. Going further, the Zohar suggests Yitro was an advisor to Pharaoh (along with two other non-Israelite prophets, Balaam and Job). Thus his mental turnaround proved exceptionally heroic, requiring him to give up his pride and ideological loyalty so as to see more clearly.

Yitro is, in a way, the first the seder guest, the first “child” in the chain of transmission. His central placement in the parasha in which God gives the Torah to the people teaches us several lessons. One such lesson is that you can be wrong about a lot, but if you’re right about the most important thing, that’s what counts. Josh Waitzkin argues that in every field, top performers are those who know how to focus on “what matters most.” You don’t have to get every detail right; you just have to be directionally right. Greatness depends on the power of abstraction and synthesis, a power shared by both novices and masters, yet often neglected by mid-level experts. Children play a central role in the seder, because they know how to focus on what matters most. Yitro plays a central role in the Jewish story, because he too knows how to focus on what matters most.

Abraham follows God. Ruth follows Naomi. Jethro follows the news. Each, in their own way, grasps what matters most: Abraham, the theologian, understands that there is one God worth following above all else. Ruth, in her declaration “your God shall be my God,” cuts through all the complexity of conversion to grasp the essential truth that joining the Jewish people means joining their destiny. And Yitro, the student of Jewish history, sees through the noise of consensus political opinion to recognize the hand of God in history.

How can it be that this small people has managed to defeat an incumbent civilization against all odds? Yitro sees what skeptics might dismiss as coincidence but what believers recognize as divine providence: the persistent thread of Jewish survival. While other civilizations rise and fall, while empires bloom and wither, the Jewish people endure. As a priest of Midian, Yitro understands power, and he recognizes in Jewish history a power that transcends normal political patterns. He remains a Midianite priest, but he grasps the essential truth of Jewish chosenness not through philosophical argument but through historical observation. The slaves who left Egypt were too close to their own story to see its larger significance. Moses, consumed by daily leadership, cannot see how his own path to burnout threatens the larger mission. But Yitro, whose name echoes yoter (more), adds something crucial to the Jewish story: the perspective of one who chooses to participate in Jewish destiny precisely because he sees its singular importance in human history.

When the Israelites accept the Torah by saying “we will do and then we will understand,” they demonstrate this same ability to grasp what matters most. The details of the Torah are not the headline. The headline is the commitment to the covenant. God doesn’t give the people a prospectus; they do a deal with no implementation plan. They don’t say, “But look at all this operational risk. How are we going to get through the desert?” Those who initially accept the Torah are hedgehogs, not foxes. They know the one big thing: God redeemed them from Egypt and is to be trusted. The rest is commentary.

Yitro is famous for enjoining Moses to set up a court system. Yitro teaches Moses the power of abstraction. This is the power of one who does not know the details of the Torah, but understands the fundamental thesis: God loves the Jewish people. Erik Hoel argues that the mind—no matter how well educated or bright—is unable to remember more than 5 +/- 2 things at any one time. This isn’t just a limitation; it’s a feature that forces wisdom upon us. Differences in knowledge come down to how people “chunk” or organize their knowledge—in other words, how they decide what matters most. In a way, this is exactly what Yitro teaches vis a vis a court system: how to chunk things, how to organize the overwhelming flow of daily disputes into meaningful patterns. Hedgehogs and foxes both know 5 +/- 2 things at any given moment; but hedgehogs know how to chunk what they know more effectively because they organize everything around their one big truth. Delegation isn&apos;t just about political bureaucracy, it&apos;s about cognition—knowing what mental tasks to hand-off, and which fundamental principles to keep firmly in focus.

A classic fox mistake—the mistake of those who know a lot—is to want to show off how much you know, particularly by focusing on edge cases. Look at all these exceptions! Ibn Paquda thought this was the cultural problem of his time. But wisdom involves knowing that exceptions are exceptional. If you treat every exception as a rule, you’re going to be making decisions from morning until nightfall.

Yitro exemplifies how being a hedgehog—knowing one big thing—can paradoxically make you better at handling many things. His outsider status allowed him to see the forest where Moses was lost among the trees. In teaching Moses to delegate, he wasn’t just solving an administrative problem; he was showing how to transform the many into the one, the fox’s scattered knowledge into the hedgehog’s vision. This is perhaps the deepest wisdom of the Jewish tradition: not that we must choose between knowing many things and knowing one big thing, but that by knowing one big thing—that God loves the Jewish people—we gain the perspective to handle the many things life throws our way.

You don’t need to be right about everything—you just need to know the 5 +/- 2 things that count. Expertise allows one to know the right things. Child-like wonder and the wonder of the naive outsider ensure that we focus on the right things. Expertise is not wisdom. And that is why the Yitros of the world will always have something to offer. Sometimes it takes a Philosemite to show the Jewish people—so expert in their own tradition—what they cannot see themselves.

        <description><![CDATA[<p>“The fox knows many things, but the hedgehog knows one big thing.” (Archilochus, Fragments)“Moses went out to meet his father-in-law; he bowed low and kissed him; each asked after the other's welfare, and they went into the tent. Moses then recounted to his father-in-law everything that the Lord had done to Pharaoh and to the Egyptians for Israel’s sake, all the hardships that had befallen them on the way, and how the Lord had delivered them. And Jethro rejoiced over all the kindness that the Lord had shown Israel when delivering them from the Egyptians. “Blessed be the Lord,” Jethro said, "who delivered you from the Egyptians and from Pharaoh, and who delivered the people from under the hand of the Egyptians. Now I know that the Lord is greater than all gods, yes, by the result of their very schemes against [the people].” (Exodus 18:7-11)NOW JETHRO… HEARD. Was Jethro the only one who heard of all that God had done? Does it not say, “Peoples heard, they were afraid” (Ex. 15, 14)? Indeed, the whole world did hear, yet Jethro alone renounced idolatry and accepted the Holy One to worship Him…Pharaoh had as his counsellors three sages: Jethro, Balaam, and Job. Jethro, as already set forth, was the minister of worship, and there was no celestial Chieftain or star of which he did not know the appropriate cult. Balaam was an arch-sorcerer, in word and act. (Zohar, Yitro, 1)<br>
