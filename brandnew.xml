                                            <p>NBA Hall of Famer Jerry West passed away earlier this week. His legacy lives on in the NBA&#8217;s logo despite decades of people questioning, denying, confirming, and all other forms of confusion-enhancing statements of whether the logo was based on Jerry West or not. Regardless, the NBA icon is one of the most powerful and valuable in sports, business, and entertainment — hopefully it will be one of the few logos to never change.

This brand uses chromatic codes and a photographic style that encourages and empowers people not to be mere spectators of their own health, but to take ownership of it.

                                            <p><strong>Opinion</strong><br />
                                            The old logo was not particularly good, mixing a very corporate-looking typeface with very flat edges for the wordmark with a rounded-cap, sausage-like icon that was as ambiguous as it gets. To its credit, it did have a hospital-slash-clinical feel. The new logo introduces an equally ambiguous icon in the sense that there isn't any evident meaning or specific association triggered by it but it is nonetheless a very handsome and dynamic-looking icon that also happens to make for a lovely, abstract “H”. The before-to-after animation is a bit of a stretch in establishing any real relationship between old and new but, arguably, the old quarter circle does indeed serve as a seed for the new shapes. I guess it could be interpreted as the various aspects of the hospital coming together to serve its patients. The wordmark is okay and I do like the subtle visual connection between the shapes of the icon and the top of the “t”.<span></span> The identity has some nice elements to it, starting with the muted and sophisticated color palette and a good typographic choice in <a href="https://djr.com/roslindale" target="_blank">Roslindale</a>, both of which give out cues that are more common in the hospitality industry than in the health industry, so the identity almost takes on a luxury hotel vibe without wading too deep in it. The photography brings back some of the clinical context with the cold-toned hues and the simple fact that so many folks in the pictures are wearing hospital uniforms, so it brings the identity back to the correct industry. The icon set is quite good too, echoing the curvature of the elements of the icon. I could probably do without the pattern… seems gratuitous and starts to look like an eye watching you. Overall, everything is well executed and the identity has a cool, calm, and collected effect that should help everybody that goes in through the door to feel at ease and confident they will receive good, attentive care.</p>

                                            <p>Before getting into it, a pat on the back to ourselves and to the designers behind the 1,500 projects that we&#8217;ve featured <a href="https://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/friday_likes_01.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">since 2012</a> after 500 editions of Friday Likes. 🎉. This week, we have another trio of food establishments with Italian and French culinary influences tying them all together, with work from Athens, Austin, and Bordeaux.</p>

<h1 class="friday_likes">Baldo by Soul</h1>
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/friday_likes_baldo.jpg" alt="Baldo by Soul" />

<p style="margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;"><a href="https://www.instagram.com/baldo_pasta" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Baldo</a> is a small, quick service restaurant in Athens, Greece, offering fresh pasta dishes in what they describe as the “coolest, freshest, Italianest pasta place” in the city. The identity, designed by local firm <a href="https://souldesign.gr/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Soul</a>, introduces a charming yet somewhat expressionless tomato — is it happy? sad? content? smug? — as the primary element paired with a single typeface, <a href="https://neubauladen.com/product/nb-grotesk-pro-35-75m-package/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NB Grotesk Pro Mono</a>, and a super simple color palette of red, green, and black. While most Italian restaurants around the world use red and green for their color palette this one manages to feel fresh and somehow distinct. The establishment itself is also great, embracing the color palette on every possible surface and infusing the space with plenty of personality thanks to the tomato and a ceiling covered in illustration. I could scroll through their Instagram page all day, it&#8217;s so fun and all those kraft-paper tubs look delectable with oodles of cheesy pasta. Bonus points for the kick-ass <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CVnUJHhBdy7/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">aprons</a>. <span class="pagination_divider"></span><span class="small_caps"><a href="https://souldesign.gr/projects/baldo-the-saucy-pasta" target="_blank" rel="noopener">See full project</a></span></p>

<h1 class="friday_likes">Rosettes by Trackmeet</h1>
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/friday_likes_rosettes.jpg" alt="Rosettes by Trackmeet" />

<p style="margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;"><a href="https://www.bunkhousehotels.com/rosettes" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rosettes</a> is an all-day café located inside Hotel Genevieve in Louisville, KY, that is &#8220;driven by simple, rustic ingredients and inspired by the sounds and aromas of al fresco Parisian cafés.&#8221; The identity, designed by Austin, TX-based <a href="https://trackmeet.studio/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trackmeet</a>, features a stunning and delicate script wordmark with one of the best long swashes I&#8217;ve seen in some time as the end of the “s” curls and swings all the way back to the initial letter while serving as the crossbar for the “t”s — if the “o” in the name would have had an accent, it would have been a fantastic trick. What ties all of the various materials though is a series of rosette — a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosette_(award)" target="_blank" rel="noopener">word</a> I&#8217;ll admit I learned today — graphics that show up in different compositions and styles, all in a sophisticated color palette of teal-ish blue and yellow. The supporting typography is also quite nice and that you can see it quickly <a href="https://freight.cargo.site/t/original/i/3afee71d439cb74f01c51fedc6caf235afbce587a5724475e16c154f2ba92db7/Rosettes_3.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a> as it&#8217;s not shown in the image above. This one&#8217;s bonus points comes from <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C7ZIgGDMuVJ/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">their branded ice cube</a>. <span class="pagination_divider"></span><span class="small_caps"><a href="https://trackmeet.studio/Rosettes" target="_blank" rel="noopener">See full project</a></span>

<h1 class="friday_likes">l’Altro Frenchie by Abmo</h1>
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/friday_likes_laltro.jpg" alt="l’Altro Frenchie by Abmo" />

<p style="margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:30px!important;"><a href="https://www.instagram.com/altro_frenchie/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">l’Altro Frenchie</a> is a restaurant by Michelin Star chef Gregory Marchand in Paris, France, that offers Italian-inspired cuisine with London and New York influences and carefully-sourced products. The identity, designed by Bordeaux, France-based <a href="https://www.abmo.fr/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Abmo</a>, revolves around a slick script wordmark with an an angled construction that gives it a bit of an edge and is only one typographic ingredient in an eclectic dish that also includes some lovely handwritten elements, the reverse-stress style of <a href="https://bureaubrut.com/en/product/traulha/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Traulha</a>, and <a href="https://eliottgrunewald.xyz/typefaces/neuf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Neuf</a>. Sprinkled throughout are some brush illustrations that could potentially feel dated or out of place but in combination with the eclectic typography they are a fun complement to the identity. The third award of bonus points is given on behalf of <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C5Na6TSiNCl/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the behind the scenes video</a> of the gold foiling of the lettering on the restaurant&#8217;s facade. <span class="pagination_divider"></span><span class="small_caps"><a href="https://www.behance.net/gallery/198019947/ALTRO-FRENCHIE" target="_blank" rel="noopener">See full project</a></span></p>

The series focuses on players establishing colonies on a series of small islands, conducting an exploration of the region, diplomacy, and trade with other civilizations and traders while managing resources and engaging in combat both on land and sea. Most games in the series take place during Renaissance and Empire-building historical periods of Earth&#8217;s history, with cultures, architecture, and customs based upon real-life elements from these periods, though in-game civilizations tend to be neutral from exact nations. Each title over the series&#8217; history has featured a variety of different developers and publishers, with the most recent entries being currently developed by Ubisoft Blue Byte and published by Ubisoft.&#8221; (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anno_(video_game_series)" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wikipedia</a>)</p>

                                            <p><strong>Relevant quote</strong><br /><em>Wieden+Kennedy Amsterdam was briefed to create the strategy and awareness launch campaign, and Wolff Olins to create the new design system for the brand. The agencies were tasked to ‘spark a desire to build’ while revolving the creative around themes of legacy and creation, connecting and galvanising its loyal community as well as new players.<br /><br />Wolff Olins created the first Anno masterbrand, one that has the flexibility to align to current and future games of the series. The agency developed a new design ethos “Crafted with Care”, which inspired the creation of a handmade, crafted look and feel for the brand.<br /><br />The brand design features a newly created “A” symbol, taking on different material textures which nod to the different worlds and ages the game can expand into. The mark represents a collective mindset of the Anno community - fusing craft, the power of the human spirit and the ambition of building for future greatness. Meticulous in detail and crafted with care, the symbol guides the community to shape what they build within the game.<br /><br />To establish Anno’s new brand platform, Wieden+Kennedy Amsterdam introduces the trailer for <em>Anno: 117 Pax Romana</em>, galvanizing fans and the gaming community at reveal. The first peek delivers the announcement the same way they used to in Ancient Rome - through a Town Crier - inviting players to build the Roman Empire. Designed as an ode to the Builder mindset, the epic 60-second trailer only features vast empty lands, from fields to marshes, leaving room for the imagination of the players. It is an invitation for all builders to join in and make this world their own - a proposition that both loyal fans and new players can relate to.

                                            <p><strong>Opinion</strong><br />
                                            While there have been — and, I am guessing, there will still be — <a href="https://www.google.com/search?sca_esv=b5d0d2a0b52daa42&amp;sca_upv=1&amp;sxsrf=ADLYWIIN_bT5HUPx3mcEKaX_vXLPzUyMaQ:1718283344195&amp;q=anno+ubisoft+logo&amp;udm=2&amp;fbs=AEQNm0Aa4sjWe7Rqy32pFwRj0UkWd8nbOJfsBGGB5IQQO6L3JzEq8sk6FPCPzvp42tv1tXoWzhWsXC_I4p4mJ4MbFnhHs2L-yVg00LknsbpIfoc32GfhSs1vd_TLYSttHEBfjJUaI0ek3N4Nq1Cx3KdnO8WsVZQDsJ5bDnjzFfqXr_iFeMhMU9_0voWCGp7cmwxv-Kd2Bxv-Bp49OdR5MVHiIueinNJwmA&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjiseqi0NiGAxWOL9AFHS4ABRMQtKgLegQIDRAB&amp;biw=1379&amp;bih=1112&amp;dpr=2" target="_blank">unique logos for each title in the series</a>, this new logo is meant to serve as the series’ masterbrand logo, which happens to be debuting directly on their latest title, <em>Anno: 117 Pax Romana</em>, which may prove a little confusing as to whether this new logo applies to all titles or just the newest one or what happens when the logo for another title is paired with the masterbrand logo? Which, granted, may not be a worry to anyone else. Regarding the new logo… it's pretty damn cool. It's as if the chiseled lettering on the Trajan column and every heavy metal logo had a baby. Or some other bad simile where classic meets bad-ass. It looks great in its flat version and it is epic in its 3D render version with the chisels coming alive in different textures.<span></span> The “A” is strong and distinct enough to stand on its own as a monogram and while it could be argued that when used as standalone element it could benefit from some indication that it's actually an “A” given that there is no crossbar, it can come across as a cool, alien-language-like graphic in a more abstract way. Wolff Olins, so far for 2024, takes the prize for going the most method on the application by actually casting the monogram in metal. Respect.<span></span> The few other applications shown are fun, engaging, and have a cool Roman Nouveau thing going on with their 3D borders and the choice of <a href="https://www.myfonts.com/collections/albertus-nova-font-monotype-imaging?refby=ucllc" target="_blank">Albertus Nova</a> for the primary typeface. The trailer is very nicely executed but it's a little confusing if it's trying to be funny or serious… like the first two set-ups for the town crier are funny and ludicrous but then he gets dead serious at the end. Still, fun. And the behind-the-scenes is great. Overall, an ambitious and well-executed overarching identity to generate excitement about the launch of the new title and to begin to establish a cohesive universe for the existing ones.</p>

Co-founded by five friends in Germany who turned the bachelor thesis of two of them — Tim Jäger and Lena Jüngst — into a company, their initial run of 80,000 starter sets sold out in six weeks and they have been on an upwards trajectory ever since, growing to other countries in Europe through 2021 and launching in the U.S. in 2022, having sold more than 5 million bottles to date. As it continues to grow globally, air up® recently introduced a new identity designed by <a href="https://www.motherdesign.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mother Design</a>.</p>

<blockquote>With the business growing rapidly, air up® identified a need for a brand that would grow with it. Mother Design has developed a new identity to elevate and change perceptions of air up®, to further position it as an aspirational lifestyle brand, as it continues to expand globally and further boost penetration in active markets.
<br /><br />The new strategy is anchored in the universal human tension between our two selves: our adult-self, which leans into responsibility and control, and our inner-child which craves play and freedom. The new identity, developed for air up® by Mother Design, aims to engage with a wide range of audiences. From kids and their parents seeking to establish healthy consumption habits at an early age, to adults looking for solutions to maintain a healthy lifestyle without sacrificing pleasure.</blockquote><h3>Mother Design provided text</h3>

<p>The logo evolution, as is usually the case, is subtle but beneficial. In this case, mainly in the balance of the thickness of the letters and the spacing between them. Before, the letters were thinner and the spacing wider, leaving the logo, ironically, with too much air within it. The thicker letters and narrower spacing create a tighter unit and offer a better rhythm. An even subtler detail that was fixed but that makes a huge difference is the position of the “a”, where the old logo had it sitting directly on the angled baseline, leaving it without an overshoot on the bottom which in turn made its top stick out. The new, clean angles on the top and bottom of each of the two words now looks much smoother. Heck, even the placing, sizing, and weight of the registered mark is an improvement.</p>

<blockquote>The tension between our two selves is seen throughout the new brand identity, with its playful custom typeface, air up® sans, and a pared-back secondary typeface. A vibrant colour palette, reflecting the variety of air up® flavours, is grounded in subtle gradients and an orderly grid. The more muted colours of the art direction are bolstered with a touch of whimsy in the styling and scenarios. The new brand has a playful, joyful tone of voice, brought to life with fluid, expressive motion.</blockquote><h3>Mother Design provided text</h3>

<p>The highlight of the identity, and it surprises me to say this given my general lack of enthusiasm towards this style, is the unicase typeface by <a href="https://hottype.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hot Type</a>. It&#8217;s bold, it&#8217;s well balanced, and I think what does it for me are the “i”s, which, in a way, break the unicase format by being shorter. They are also a nice pay-off on the concept of the adult-self and inner-child, with the “i”s looking like little kids among the rest of the grown-up letters. I also really dig the oversized punctuation marks. The one character that throws me off is the “a”, which ends up looking too big and I wonder if there was an opportunity to tie it with the logo by using a double-storey “a” instead. The color palette is pretty nice and the photography is both playful and warm.</p>

<blockquote>To visualise the concept of taste experienced through smell, and the range of flavours that are captured with the interchangeable air up® pods, Mother Design used generative technology software. The studio harnessed 3D design tools such as Nomad Sculpt and Spline to work towards a tangible visual language that served to reflect a totally new sensory experience.</blockquote><h3>Mother Design provided text</h3>

<p class="end">Sadly, not much in application, because I would have enjoyed seeing more examples of how this plays out. Like, the one glimpse at the motion behavior of the typography in the Instagram post is pretty cool, there are some groovy gradients being used, and the copywriting has some hints of cleverness but it all stops short of building a stronger case. Overall, the new identity&#8217;s biggest boost comes from the typography, which helps signal a playful personality while the photography and tone of voice give it a more confident and grown-up presence.</p>
