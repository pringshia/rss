                                            <p>VSA Partners, a strategy and creative agency that has been around for more than 40 years, has launched <a href="https://www.design4better.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Design4Better</a>, a “new initiative that reimagines creative brand designs not just for clients or pitches, but for the pure joy of design” and a space where “visitors can see what happens when top talent is given the space to design and create with no boundaries”. In other words, designing for the sake of design and without any boundaries set by a design brief. Is this a good look for an agency the size of VSA? Will it get them the type of clients they are freely designing for? Is the design really, truthfully for the better?

Founded in 1996 by Robert F. X. Sillerman as SFX Entertainment, the company&#8217;s business was built around consolidating concert promoters into a national entity to counter the oversized influence of ticket behemoth Ticketmaster. In 2000, the company was sold to Clear Channel Communications for $4.4 billion and operated as Clear Channel Entertainment until 2005, when it was spun off as Live Nation. In 2010, Live Nation merged with the ticketing firm Ticketmaster to form a larger conglomerate named Live Nation Entertainment.&#8221; (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_Nation_(events_promoter)" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wikipedia</a>)</p>

                                            <p><strong>Opinion</strong><br />
                                            I'm not a concert person so I rarely interact with Live Nation which I mention because from those few rare occasions where I did, the one thing that stood out (and stuck) about the logo was the thick frame and the red “LIVE”. Neither of those elements looked dated, wrong, or out of place so I'm surprised they were discarded. The provided text hints at the reason being that the red color should not command attention in the logo but to serve as a highlight in support of the artists, venues, and events but I don't see how a little red in the logo would be detrimental. In any case, what's done is done, leaving the type alone to serve as the logo.<span></span> The updates to the typography are mostly lateral moves as both versions are equally acceptable. The subtle modifications of wider “N”s and more squared-off “V” and “A” pay off in the stacked version where there is some satisfying elements between the characters across the two lines but when spread out in a single line, those “N”s kind of dwarf the rest of the letters, as they end up being way to wide. In the end, the logo still has a solid, bold presence that spells out the name so it's hard to find any actual faults with it other than there not being any significant improvements in terms of functionality, memorability, or excitement.<span></span> The applications are technically fine but it's also difficult to mess up repeating the logo on stuff with only three colors in play. The general approach of make it big, make it bold, ask questions later is fine and, like the logo, hard to find any actual fault with it but there it's also hard to find anything to be excited about and, to be fair, I guess the excitement should come from the artists and events themselves not a corporate-branded skateboard. Overall, the definition of “fine”… not great, not bad… and nothing here seems to advance the Live Nation brand in any particular way or direction but it also doesn't pull it back or hinder it but I won't be screaming for an encore.</p>

                                                                                
                                                                                
                                        
                                        
                            ]]>

<p>Let’s start with the logomark, dubbed “The Pinnacle.” But first, a quick sidebar: My gaming experience peaked with <em>Tenchu: Stealth Assassins, Gran Turismo, and Tomb Raider II</em> on PS2 sometime in the early 2000s, so I no longer identify as a gamer, nor do I have any personal frame of reference for League of Legends, aside from reviewing <a href="https://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/new_logo_and_identity_for_wild_rift_esports_by_designstudio.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wild Rift Esports</a> and <a href="https://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/new_logo_and_identity_for_msi_24_by_studio_dumbar_dept.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MSI24</a> here on Brand New (both of which were absolute bangers). So saying I’m not the target audience is an understatement. HOWEVER — even without deep LoL familiarity, the Pinnacle clearly commands an imposing presence, and man, does this thing mean business. Five spiked forms interlock into a single, ominous icon — a powerful symbol of five players acting as one, and a subtle metaphor for regional unity. Whether you&#8217;re the type to recognize “support,” “bot,” “mid,” “jungle,” and “top” as specific gameplay roles (is that what they are??) or just vaguely recall button-mashing your way through digital battlefields eons ago, the symbolism of strength in formation in this mark reads loud and clear. With its hard edges, menacing geometry, and jagged symmetry, it conjures a spiked gauntlet or sinister faceplate torn straight from fantasy armor — forged in fire and ready for battle. Cinematic renderings give it serious weight, and its ability to stand tall (even when used solo) makes it the identity’s most iconic, ownable asset.</p>

<p>The custom logotype, built from, Ignite, LCP’s bespoke typeface (more on this further on in the review) is a worthy match. With squared-off counters, dramatically spiky ink traps, and razor-sharp angles, the letterforms radiate intensity — like each glyph has been hewn from the same alloy as the Pinnacle. While not everyone will be onboard with the aesthetic (it walks the same fine line between badass and overcooked that many sports brands do — and I’ll admit, I initially thought it was way overdone, but I’ve since warmed up to it), it definitely fits the tone. I especially like how the forms nod to both a medieval past and a digital, alien future.</p>

<p>Some glyphs — most notably the “G,” &#8220;U,&#8221; “O,” and “P” — also employ the ol’ some-sharp-some-rounded corner trick, which <em>usually</em> reeks of non-type-designers getting behind the wheel and making unjustified customizations (read: typographic butchery) just to be edgy but, much like the spiky ink traps, as polarizing of a solution as this is for some, in the context of League of Legends, I actually think it works. It adds just the right amount of tension to a typeface that’s already operating in an aggressive visual register.</p>

<p>Interestingly, while a full “League of Legends Championship Pacific” logotype exists, it’s rarely the primary identifier. Most branded materials lean heavily on the logomark and an “LCP” monogram — a smart move not just for brevity, but for visual punch. Depending on your tolerance for the aforementioned ink traps, the full logotype might feel a bit… aggressive. But the monogram distills all that energy down to its most legible, effective form. It’s fast, fierce, and forged from the same visual DNA — a three-letter shorthand that hits hard.</p>

<blockquote>
APAC’s legacy in League of Legends is undeniable—but its future needed to be redefined. The LCP was created not just as a league for pro players, but as a celebration of the fans, cultures, and communities that make APAC one of the most vibrant and diverse regions in Esports.
<br /><br />
To shape a league that truly reflected this richness, the team immersed itself in the unique subcultures and rituals of each market—from Japan’s Oshi fandoms and cosplay scene to Southeast Asia’s hyper-social fan dynamics and high-stakes digital banter.
<br /><br />
At the center of the strategy sits What We’re Made Of—a unifying platform that distills the region’s complexity into a bold statement of intent. It honors the stories, styles, and hunger that APAC brings to the game, and declares that this region isn’t just here to participate—it’s here to compete. Every part of the LCP identity was crafted to bring this platform to life, from voice and motion to texture and type—showing the world exactly what the region is made of.

<figcaption>Brand tone and language.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>If you’ve read any of my reviews, you know how much I geek out on brand strategy and tone of voice. Get those right, and the rest of the identity tends to fall into place. In the case of LCP, the foundational theme — <em>What We’re Made Of</em> — gives this brand its spine. It’s a smart, unifying idea that celebrates the region’s diversity, honors the fierce competitive spirit of its players, and serves as a rallying cry for fans across wildly different cultures and languages. It’s not just about gameplay — it’s about pride, passion, and the stories that shape this scene.</p>

<p>Tied to that strategic backbone is a red-hot tone of voice, aptly dubbed <em>All Fired Up.</em> And it’s pitch perfect. On the surface, it nods to the visual style: all heat, pressure, and spiked geometry forged in fire. But it also captures the emotional intensity of the league and its audience. This isn’t a brand that quietly earns your respect. It kicks down your door and demands it. Players are fired up. Fans are fired up. The energy is fired up. And the net effect is raw, focused, and unrelenting.</p>

<p>What makes it even better is that this strategy doesn&#8217;t just talk the talk. It walks the walk, and it shows up everywhere. It’s not some clever language buried in a case study and forgotten the moment the deck is closed. It’s visible. It’s alive. It flexes in the motion behaviors. It powers the illustrations. It shapes the iconography. It fuels the rhythm of the copy. That level of conceptual follow-through is what takes a brand from looking good to feeling <em>perfect</em> — and this one feels like it could burst into flame at any moment.</p>

<blockquote>
LCP’s identity was crafted to deliver impact across every digital and physical touchpoint. From teaser comms and in-depth player stats to arena dressings and broadcast graphics, it’s a system built for clarity, flexibility, and hype.
<br /><br />
A modular graphic system, inspired by League’s iconic in-game lanes, brings structure and energy to every format. It scales seamlessly, whether it’s being used to showcase player highlights on social, hype up fans in the arena, or deliver stat-rich content in broadcast environments.

Now, let&#8217;s dive into each of these visual identity elements one-by-one, shall we?</p>

<blockquote>
Headlining the brand is the custom-designed variable type family ‘LCP Ignite.’ Inspired by our ‘Fired Up’ brand voice and the shape of Summoner’s Rift, it is designed to work successfully across the wide breadth of league communications without ever losing its intensity.
<br /><br />
To reflect APAC’s linguistic diversity, the system also incorporates Archivo, Noto Sans JP, Kinkakuji, Noto Sans TC, and Thonglor Soi 4 Nr. These typefaces work in harmony with Ignite, ensuring consistency across scripts and accessibility for a multilingual fanbase.

<figcaption>Custom type.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Ignite — the bespoke typeface created for LCP — isn’t just built for headlines, it’s built for… everything. A variable display typeface with compressed, condensed, and standard widths, Ignite gives the system a ton of flexibility while never compromising on attitude. The spiky ink traps and some-sharp-some-rounded corners are on full display throughout the glyph set, and, depending on your tolerance for the ones used in the logotype, characters like “B,” “Q,” “R,” “0,” “3,” “5,” “6,” “8,” and “9” might feel either especially egregious or especially awesome, as this custom typeface is everywhere, all at once. Some might see it as typographic heresy. Others, a bold, stylistic flex. But there’s no denying that, when used across materials at this scale and frequency, Ignite becomes one of the brand’s most distinct, defining elements. And that animated sequence of hot type letters coming together is a brilliant visual metaphor for how this brand — and its type system — are all Fired Up.</p>

<p>Supporting typefaces do their job without stepping on Ignite’s toes. <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Archivo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Archivo</a> — a squarish, technical grotesque from <a href="https://fonts.google.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Fonts</a> — carries most of the body copy duties for Western scripts, while Google Fonts <a href="https://fonts.google.com/noto/specimen/Noto+Sans+JP" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Noto Sans JP,</a> <a href="https://fonts.adobe.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Adobe Fonts</a> <a href="https://fonts.adobe.com/fonts/kinkakuji" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kinkakuji,</a> Google Fonts <a href="https://fonts.google.com/noto/specimen/Noto+Sans+TC" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Noto Sans TC,</a> and Adobe Fonts <a href="https://fonts.adobe.com/fonts/thonglor-soi-4-nr" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Thonglor Soi 4 Nr</a> round out the multilingual family for Japanese, Chinese, and Thai content, respectively. Together, they form a system that’s versatile, readable, and culturally responsive — but still unified in tone.</p>

<blockquote>
The type system extends into iconography—all drawn from the strokes and spirit of Ignite. Fluid, spiked, and expressive, the icon set was developed to translate fan energy into visual language. These elements are built to live across content, commentary, merch, and meme culture—made to move with the community as the league grows.

<figcaption>Type and icons.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The icon system feels like an extension of Ignite’s DNA: all spikes, sweeps, and sharpened aggression. Each icon looks like it could double as an alien blade or arcane artifact, with curving forms that suggest both elegance and lethality. There’s a distinctly weaponized quality to them; they&#8217;re elaborate, battle-ready, and visually right at home in the League of Legends universe (at least from what I&#8217;ve seen of it). Beyond the armor and edge, though, there’s an organic rhythm at play: the curls and coils echo the rising movement of flames, reinforcing the brand’s “Fired Up” tone of voice. Paired with Ignite, the icons don’t just coexist, they strike in harmony.</p>

<figcaption>Illustrations and messaging.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The illustrations are pure fucking fire: high-contrast, comics-inspired, hard-edged, and heavy on attitude. They bring an extra layer of visual aggression to the system, with bold angles and searing highlights that practically leap off the screen. Stylistically, they channel the pulp-noir intensity of <a href="https://blog.bruteprop.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Aidan Hughes (aka Brute!),</a> best known for his almost-four-decade-long relationship with industrial metal band <a href="https://kmfdm.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">KMFDM</a> as their primary album cover artist. It’s a perfect reference point: gritty, graphic, and gloriously over-the-top. These badass illustrations don’t just complement the identity — they turn it into a graphic novel waiting to happen.</p>

<p>This isn&#8217;t one of those every-color-of-the-rainbow color palettes, and it&#8217;s refreshingly restrained: primary tones of black, orange, and off-white do most of the heavy lifting, while secondary hues like gray, tan-gold, and yellow round out the range. It’s tight, high-contrast, and beautifully optimized for both digital and print. All fire, no filler.</p>

<blockquote>
LCP’s motion language mirrors the speed and intensity of the game itself, designed to move with the rhythm of real-time esports. Drawing on League’s iconic in-game lanes, the system frames, transitions, and summons content with precision, whether it’s surfacing a stat mid-match or counting down to kick-off.
<br /><br />
There’s a pulse to how fans engage with the game (think quick reactions, instant hype) and the type treatments reflect that, with a bold, stream-inspired energy that feels fast, focused, and alive. Visually, the texture system dials up contrast and impact, blending molten finishes with cool tones for a brand that feels premium and built for every screen.

<figcaption>Visual identity elements in motion.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Motion is where the LCP identity really unleashes its ultimate high-impact, high-damage visual strike that hits with precision and style. Built around three core behaviors — <em>Lanes</em> for organizing dense content, <em>Stream Speak</em> for animating lists with urgency, and <em>Summoning</em> for assembling the logomark with theatrical flair — the system balances chaos and control beautifully. Whether it’s a clean content transition or a cinematic brand moment, every movement feels purposeful, punchy, and dialed all the way up.</p>

<blockquote>
As broadcast UX and competitive formats continue to evolve, the identity provides a strong foundation: regionally fluent, emotionally resonant, and competitively ambitious. And while this marks the brand’s official unveiling, fans have already seen its early sparks—through late 2024 campaign teasers, test events, and broadcast experiments.

<figcaption>Gameplay.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Broadcast visuals are where everything truly clicks into place. Koto clearly built this identity with broadcast contexts in mind, and it shows. Every element, from type to motion to illustration, performs flawlessly under the pressure of high-speed, high-stakes gameplay. It’s frenetic and fast-paced, but thanks to the brand’s rock-solid motion principles, there’s a visual harmony threading through it all. The result is an experience that feels cohesive and intentional, no matter how chaotic the on-screen action gets — a brand system that not only keeps up, but <em>levels up</em> the viewing experience.</p>

<blockquote>
Multiple external vendors will continue to be involved over the LCP’s lifespan—alongside Riot’s core team—so it was crucial to build a strong, cohesive brand that could flex seamlessly across every medium.
<br /><br />
In addition to developing comprehensive brand guidelines, we collaborated closely with the Riot Games team to produce an extensive suite of templates and toolkits to support the creation of social content, print materials, event graphics, campaign assets, and more.
<br /><br />
This suite extends from online to offline, ensuring the brand delivers the high-impact presence required for every LCP main event—from arena displays to environmental branding and beyond.

<p>The sheer flexibility of the LCP system is on full display across every imaginable application — from title cards and arena graphics to lanyards, team jerseys, social posts, and OOH advertising. No matter the format, the identity flexes hard without ever breaking. Every asset feels unmistakably LCP, thanks to a visual and tonal ecosystem that’s both richly layered and incredibly cohesive. The toolkit is so robust and well-orchestrated, it seems almost limitless in expression — yet every piece still sings the same tune. That’s the hallmark of a system built not just for consistency, but for creative versatility at scale.</p>

<blockquote>
Ultimately, what makes the APAC region so strong is its people—a powerful blend of passionate fans, professional players, and dedicated novices, all united by a shared love for the game.
<br /><br />
The LCP brand exists to recognize and reward that spirit—with merch that fans can wear on their chest and display in their homes, proudly showing the world both their roots and where their passion lies.

<p>The swag hits just as hard as the rest of the brand. Custom trading cards — featuring the fierce, comics-style illustrations — are a standout, whether they’re meant to depict players or characters (honestly, I don&#8217;t know, but who cares? they&#8217;re freakin&#8217; <em>sweet</em> either way). But just take a moment to gaze upon the rendering of the custom PC case, which shows the internal fan firing up through the Pinnacle like it’s channeling raw magic. Is it real? Probably not. Does it matter? Definitely not. It’s a jaw-dropping proof of concept that turns the act of powering on a gaming rig into a fully branded moment.</p>

<blockquote>
From Vietnam to Singapore, Tokyo to Taipei, the LCP taps into the pride, talent, and passion that already runs deep across APAC and channels it into something greater: a unified force ready to make its mark.
<br /><br />
Backed by positive early momentum, the LCP is proving to be more than a league—it’s a bold statement. It’s a brand that puts the full weight of the region’s ambition back in play and demands the world take notice. The stage is set, and the time has come to show exactly what the LCP is made of.

<p class="end">From top to bottom, this identity is a powerhouse of cohesion, energy, and brand storytelling — and Koto totally nailed it (but honestly, is anyone surprised?). But they didn’t just design a logo or assemble a toolkit — they built a world. One where every element, from the fiercest glyph to the flicker of a motion behavior, feels forged in the same fire. It’s rare to see this level of strategic clarity carried through with such aesthetic intensity, and rarer still to see it applied across such a vast range of formats without losing an ounce of punch. Whether you’re a die-hard LoL fan or, like me, haven’t picked up a controller in a zillion years, the message is clear: LCP isn’t just showing up — it’s setting the standard.</p>

We took all the tricks from US shelves and enhanced the brand with top-notch European design.<br /><br />Shamelessly shiny and inviting to crack the market. Created according to the global rules of snack brands. Ingredients: a short name, a dominant logo, a hierarchy of just a few elements, a unifying colour, expressive photos, a clear separation of flavours, and a few retro crumbs.<br /><br />RAXI — inspired by the USA — created in Lithuania — dedicated to the whole world.

                                            <p><strong>Opinion</strong><br />
                                            The old name, logo, and packaging were all actually quite nice and had a sort of folkloric vibe to them that was endearing but certainly not primed for a broader market or mainstream appeal so the parent company has basically started from scratch.<span></span> While the new name is short, sweet, and even has a nice ring to it, it does feel rather random as if they committed to pulling out two consonants and two vowels out of a hat and putting them together no matter what they got. Maybe there is some fun, double-play of Raxi in Lithuanian? Regardless… it sounds snack-y. The logo is pretty great, with an exuberant flared sans serif sporting some generous curvature in the right places (like the leg of the “R”, the bowl of the “a”, the strokes of the “x”) and an even more generous drop shadow. I could have done without the little curl on the “R” but I also don't mind it that much.<span></span> The packaging is great too in how unapologetically bold and in-your-face it is. It really has no ulterior motive or hidden agenda: big logo, big pictures of the product, big pictures of the ingredient, all as enticing as possible. The primary brand orange color is paired with some equally bold and bright colors for some punchy combinations, all of which are surprisingly successful on their own and as a family.<span></span> The supporting typography in the packaging (and the “CRACKERS” accent in the logo) using <a href="https://www.myfonts.com/collections/apercu-condensed-font-colophon-foundry?refby=ucllc" target="_blank">Apercu Condensed</a> is a solid complement while also a sturdy yet fun typeface for use in headlines and throughout the website. Overall, this is bold, youthful, and snack-y, hitting all of the key traits of an Instagram- and TikTok-ready product that is just one influencer endorsement away from global fandom (although first they just have to get <a href="https://www.instagram.com/raxi_snacks/" target="_blank">their own social media</a> under control).

Their name originally came from &#8220;Technology&#8221; + &#8220;Banking&#8221; and they are most well known in the country for having introduced Brazil&#8217;s first 24-hour ATMS, a huge deal at the time. 40 years later, they still manage ATMs, but now they also offer an entire infrastructure for the handling of cash transactions from routers to Wi-Fi, antennas, self-checkout machines, smart vaults, and even secure cash transportation. Recently, Tecban worked with <a href="https://www.futurebrand.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FutureBrand</a> in São Paulo, Brazil to create a new identity.</p>

Tecban, a leading Brazilian company in financial and technological solutions, was facing a fragmented brand architecture. Multiple sub-brands created confusion in the customer journey and diluted the overall perception of value. The challenge was clear: integration. We needed to reduce brand complexity and align perception with the company’s new phase — more connected, more digital, more essential.

</figure>

<p>Despite some good efforts, the old logo and identity felt very heavy. The line-and-square element really starts to limit the visual opportunities by blocking in the graphics. Additionally, the use of black, grays, and red probably needed to be restrained a bit, but the bigger issue was a lack of visual cohesion between the layouts. The spacing, sizes and placements were all over the place. TecBan (as it was spelled at the time) clearly needed more than a makeover, they needed a directional change.</p>

<blockquote>
The new symbol — a simplified “T” made of a dot and a dash — suggests motion and represents the balance between physical and digital worlds.

<p>The new logo distances itself from the old logo in a series of ways. The typeface is a geometric sans-serif that reads well across the letter pairs and the name is now spelled with a lowercase &#8220;b&#8221;. I like that both of these changes help create a better rhythm across the name while the ascender on the &#8220;b&#8221; does just enough to break up the &#8220;tec&#8221; and &#8220;ban&#8221;. The symbol is really quite wonderful. Yes, there are others out there that have used similar geometric shapes to create a &#8220;T&#8221;, but this one feels really nice. What they call a dash and a dot, is really an obround (or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stadium_(geometry)" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stadium</a>) over a circle. But, the thickness and position of the symbol aside the wordmark makes a really comfortable logo.</p>

<p>The cleverness of the symbol is discovered when it is rendered as a 3-dimensional shape. The obround and circle become different views of the same capsule shape and, as they rotate, the original symbol is revealed. This is a delightfully simple solution that creates one of those &#8216;ooooh&#8217; moments when you see it.</p>

<p>This solution also makes for some straightforward and enjoyable background patterns.</p>

<blockquote>
We unified all sub-brands under a single name — Tecban — and developed a new visual identity based on the concept: “Simple is more.”
<br /><br />
The new system is minimalist, elegant, and functional. The predominantly white backgrounds combined with strategic use of vibrant red create a clean and iconic aesthetic. Geometric shapes and a tech-inspired typeface reinforce clarity, integration, and accessibility. 
<br /><br />
Every element was designed with attention to detail and cross-platform performance in mind, including motion design and digital interactions.

<p>The graphic/infographic examples all work. There is a nice harmony across the examples that comes across in the sensitivity in the size and placement of shapes as well as the different types of motion. In particular I appreciate the steadfastness in using such a limited color set. So many brands seem to want an infinite collection of colors, yet here we can see how well it can work without.</p>

<p>The photography took a minute to take in. I see the direction, but I feel like there is an unnecessary tension between the shadows and warm lighting. I do like the introduction of the burgundy as a &#8216;not brand&#8217; brand color. Yet, at some point I feel a broader range of photos will need to be generated as they include other products, systems and people. (This has already started to happen on the website.)</p>

<p>The website, mobile, and app each expand the identity system. The obround shapes become containers for photography set in front of a white background with floating text. It is a simple equation that is successful because it is executed so well. And, because it is graphically focused, small little moments pop, like the playfully sped up spin on the loading screens are fun, and at the same time are solid in their design as flat graphics that flash a subtle gradient to imply dimension as it spins into place.</p>

<p>When the layouts become photo-first, like on the static ads, I start to get a Tron-like science fiction feel. They seem too vague. The digital ads are better, but they too feel a bit underwhelming. I wish that there was something interesting on the backside of the machines to make the spin worth it. </p>

<p class="end">I started this review by noting that Tecban needed a new direction. They were all over the map, hoping that a color would hold their identity together. Well, two things happened: they found a direction and streamlined the colors. Those are now the two strengths of the identity. For an organization as large as Tecban, having consistency has to be a top goal. Typically, the design suffers. However, this feels like the opposite. The design is brought forward by the simplification and their new identity is as good as cash.</p>
