Featuring blooming tea leaves wrapping around a hoppy bud with effervescent sparkles, the icon symbolizes the harmonious blend of our botanical ingredients.<br /><br />The rebrand of Hoptonic boosted shelf presence and attracted investor interest, enabling nationwide distribution. Initially available in select Berkeley, California stores, Hoptonic’s rebrand gained popularity and is now proudly stocked in Whole Foods and Sprouts nationwide.

                                            <p><strong>Opinion</strong><br />
                                            The old logo tried to put a hop in its step with a reverse-stress sans serif but the contrast was so subtle it almost looked like a font that was scaled vertically. The tea leaves icon was also wildly generic. The new logo is a massive improvement not just by contrast with the old one but by how nicely the new lettering is executed. With a high-contrast serif foundation in place, the angled axis of the counterspaces on the round letters — matched by the angle of the middle stroke of the “N” — give the otherwise stately and luxurious type style a dose of playfulness while the “ON” pair makes it memorable and unique with the “N” tucking in so smoothly under the small “O”. Bonus points to Lobster Phone for not just shrinking the big “O” into a little “O” but actually drawing it to match the thicks and thins of the rest of the letters. The sparkly icon above the wordmark is charming; it better represents the product (which mixes tea leaves and hops); and its wispy negative spaces nicely echo the flared serifs in the wordmark.<span></span> The old packaging was so sad, looking more like a home-made herbal remedy to cure a cold than an exciting consumer product. Like the logo, the new packaging is a major glow-up and while it now operates a little too well within the ever-growing healthy drink market by blending in with many other canned drinks with their arched typography and optimistic graphics, it still has some distinct features to make it stand out among the competition. Aside from the cool logo, the pattern on the bottom of the can is quite lovely and the bold typography on top for each of the flavors is, literally, a solid contrast. The changing icons above the wordmark are good but they lack the finesse and detail of the main icon and it would have been great to see that same attention to detail and contrast of thicks and thins applied to all of these. Still, the combination of elements and contrast of the two halves of the can add up to a very attractive shelf presence. Really digging the shipping box cases too, with the huge typography and graphics all around and the swag is quite attractive. Overall, this wasn't hard to improve upon and any little bit would have helped but this redesign is lovingly crafted and executed, elevating the brand to the next tier where it can compete on a national level in stores and online, direct to consumer.</p>

With the two quadrennial competitions taking place in nearly the exact same dates — featuring the finals match for both on the same amazing Sunday — the frenzy for coverage was at an all-time high in the U.S., specially since the country hosted the Copa América. FOX Sports covered 78 live matches over 30 days. According to <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/bradadgate/2024/07/17/euro-cup--copa-amrica-set-english-language-audience-records-on-fox/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Forbes</a>, the Euro Cup tournament averaged 1.68 million viewers on Fox and FS1, up 34% from 1.25 million on ESPN&#8217;s 2021 coverage and it became the most-watched Euro Cup on English-language television. Copa América averaged 1.42 million across Fox Sports, an increase of over 350% from the 2021 tournament and it set a viewing record for English-language television networks on FOX. Unifying the coverage was an on-air look designed by Barcelona, Spain-based <a href="https://thrumotion.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">THRU</a>.</p>

<blockquote>Summer of Stars encapsulates the essence of summer while the world’s top soccer stars shine on the grandest stages. THRU brought this concept to life through a comprehensive design system, including concept development, design, animation, and editable templates. We collaborated with David Rinman, who was crucial in shaping the design of the system, and Ricardo Rey for the 3D trophies. A unified design system for Summer of Stars ensured consistency across layouts, color palettes, typography, and graphic elements. Developed in close communication with FOX SPORTS, every design decision aligned with their vision. </blockquote><h3><a href="https://thrumotion.com/foxsportssummerofstars/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">THRU project page</a></h3>

<p>With the slightly cheesy name of “Summer of Stars”, this identity could have gone in a number of equally cheesy visual directions but they actually managed to turn it into something unexpectedly bad-ass and exciting while also avoiding using literal stars or any other visual cliché related to the celestial bodies. Instead, they cleverly took the stars of the tournament — the players and the countries they represent — and repeated their names at just the right angles to create a star in the negative space. Simple, effective, and dynamic as well as endlessly flexible once each country&#8217;s colors come into play and with the optional addition of silhouetted players. (I kind of wish they had done a duotone or monotone approach on the photography as that could have looked pretty cool.)</p>

<p>Part of what makes the star system work so well is the motion, with the typography sliding in and out of the five text areas that define the star in the center but even in static form, the compositions are great and probably at their best when the letters in the text don&#8217;t touch so crisply as they do in “ENGLAND” but are more open as they do in “URUGUAY” which makes the star shape a little less obvious. It&#8217;s also worth noting the stars, and all the system, uses the free Google Font, <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Anton" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Anton</a>, which, admittedly, I would scroll past it without a second thought if I were looking for a great condensed sans serif.</p>

<blockquote>Stripes are heavily present in flags and soccer imagery, here they worked as base for a flexible system that allows for creative variation while maintaining brand consistency.

</figure>

<p>As a secondary and supporting treatment, a series of thick horizontal stripes help deliver information and frame content. It&#8217;s also simple and effective and while I imagine the stars and stripes were separate design concepts originally, the two work well together: the stars draw you in with their flashier presence while the stripes keep you engaged and informed with a more passive design presence with Anton serving as the glue between both. Also, literally running across both treatments is the fun motion gesture of the typography scaling horizontally — on purpose — as it comes in and out of frame with some elasticity to it.</p>

<p>Not a whole lot to say about the trophies, other than I really like the contrast of the hyper-detailed, hyper-shiny 3D renderings with the flat, colorful typography. The two things could look atrocious together but the grayscale (or, I guess, silverscale) patina of the trophies really pops with the color and type behind it.</p>

<p class="end">The real hero in all of this is Anton and how well it handles all of the different treatments and how it&#8217;s able to take on primary or secondary roles without breaking a sweat. (I mean, the heroes are the designers that made this happen but, still, hat tip to Anton.) Overall, this is a pretty amazing system that is engaging and dynamic in both animated and static forms while being able to properly represent and do justice to teams and players from two continents in a neutral way and make it exciting to the growing U.S. audience for international football.</p>

The elephant logo is officially a trademark owned by the Republican National Committee and is subject to the same laws that govern any other logo, whether it&#8217;s Nike&#8217;s or Apple&#8217;s. This, however, seems to be lost on the legal counsel for the CBSCL who claims they CAN use the logo and that the cease-and-desist request infringes on their right to free speech and that they will continue to use it, thank you very much, and will counter-sue Wyoming Republican Party if they keep bugging them about it. This lawyer has chosen the hill he is going to die on.

It is the second-oldest continually operating United States bank; its predecessor, Union Bank, was founded in 1792. State Street is ranked 14th on the list of largest banks in the United States by assets. It is one of the largest asset management companies in the world with US$3.7 trillion under management and US$40.0 trillion under custody and administration in 2023. It is the largest custodian bank in the world, providing securities services and it is considered a systemically important bank by the Financial Stability Board. Along with BlackRock and Vanguard, State Street is considered to be one of the Big Three index fund managers that dominate corporate America. The company is ranked 316th on the Fortune 500 as of 2022. The company is on the list of the banks that are too big to fail published by the Financial Stability Board. It is rated by Visual Capitalist as the third U.S. bank by uninsured deposits, with 91.2% of deposits being uninsured. The company is named after State Street in Boston, which was known as the ‘Great Street to the Sea’ in the 18th century as Boston became a flourishing maritime capital. The company&#8217;s logo formerly included a clipper ship to reflect the maritime industry in Boston during this time.&#8221; (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_Street_Corporation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wikipedia</a>)</p>

                                            <p><strong>Relevant quote</strong><br /><em>We partnered with State Street to evolve its brand, first with a compelling articulation of State Street’s story, differentiation and vision for the future, and then with a reimagined identity built for the modern world. Our remit was clear: create a category-leading brand that unified State Street and communicated the breadth of its offerings.<br /><br />We needed to create a dynamic, ownable brand expression that would reinforce State Street’s differentiation in a category where competitors are modernizing and raising the bar. The new logo evokes the brand’s name—the central ‘street’ within the symbol represents the journey State Street designs for its clients — helping them stay on track, turn market change into potential, and continue to be the steadying hand and stabilizing force that’s reshaping the industry. The central line of the symbol extends across the system, serving as the underlying grid as well as a visible connective element through photography, patterns and icons, acting as a nod to State Street platforms that underpin financial markets.<br /><br />The brand expression integrates State Street’s longevity and vision, using elements that take inspiration from both traditional and future-facing cues. This includes adopting a modern serif typeface and energizing State Street’s legacy blue. Mezzotint images provide a distinct way of capturing subjects, combining the bespoke quality of engraving with a modern digital language.<br /><br />The new system is built to thrive across digital channels, with fresh content, imagery, and styles that cascade across platforms. To celebrate the new brand, we helped coordinate a robust re-introduction of State Street across all stakeholder groups. This included a rebuild of the State Street corporate website, social media presence, launch microsite, presentation system, pitch narrative and more. These activations showcase State Street’s story, commitments, expression and leadership, with opportunities for audiences to engage across content and media or connect directly.

                                            With a ship icon <a href="https://logos.fandom.com/wiki/State_Street" target="_blank">since the 1970s</a>, the latest version was a very conservative, financial-looking drawing that portrayed the institution as sturdy and trustworthy amidst the metaphorical rough waters of the world of money. It was fairly antiquated, though, and now made the company come across as old and stodgy. The new logo abandons the ship for the first time in a long time and introduces a more abstract representation of its name with an icon depicting a street running straight across a parallel, winding road. There is a nice symmetry to the icon and it has a smooth flow. The  wordmark is simple and safe, complementing the icon well with its stacked composition, further establishing that strong horizon line. The That Blue color choice adds a touch of Finance Nouveau, quickly signaling this is a digitally-aware and contemporary institution (while also having a bit of a forced “aren't we hip with our electric blue color?!" vibe).<span></span> The identity seems to go in a number of directions and adopt various stylistic approaches in a way that feels like they are looking to see what sticks. There is the 3D wavy patterns, the icon in 3D dipping in and out of a surface, there is etched illustrations, there is birds, there is people… it's a little all over the place. The most effective gesture is the one most closely tied to the logo, with the thin lines literally forming baselines for the typography — the very nice <a href="https://lettersfromsweden.se/font/lab-antiqua/" target="_blank">Lab Antiqua</a>. Overall, everything is well executed and the influx of energy of That Blue is hard to deny, helping State Street sail into a new era.</p>

                                            <p>Established in 2019, <a href="https://www.betano.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Betano</a> is a leading digital gaming and sports betting operator — also known as iGaming, an umbrella term encompassing all forms of online casino games, online sports betting, and all other forms of online gambling. Owned by Greece-based <a href="https://kaizengaming.com/home" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kaizen Gaming</a>, one of the fastest-growing game tech companies internationally, Betano is available in 15 countries and offers a wide range of products, including sportsbook, live betting, and casino-style games. While big in Europe, perhaps it&#8217;s bigger in Brazil, where it is considered the most recognizable and trusted betting brand. Part of its success is the company&#8217;s expanding sponsorship of football teams around the world, including powerhouses like Aston Villa in the UK, Olympiacos F.C. in Greece, and the “Big Three” of S.L. Benfica, Sporting CP, and FC Porto in Portugal. Betano was a global sponsor of the recent 2024 Copa América and also the first ever betting partner of UEFA EURO this Summer as well. Earlier this year, Betano introduced a new identity designed by London, UK-based <a href="https://www.nomadstudio.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nomad</a>.</p>

<blockquote>Rapid payouts, super-fast updates reflecting real-world events, and the sheer adrenaline rush that iGaming offers made the lightning bolt the perfect symbol for Betano. With energetic custom lettering and a detachable “B” for icon use, the logo delivers maximum impact wherever it appears.</blockquote><h3><a href="https://www.nomadstudio.com/work/betano" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nomad project page</a></h3>

<p>The old logo was… something. I mean, it was clearly a “B” but there are so many unanswered questions: why hollow? where is the light source coming from that it casts shadows and lights symmetrically? what otherworldly material is it made from? how much crack does one need to be on to construct and SVG like <a href="https://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/betano_old_svg.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this</a>? what does it mean? We will never know but some questions are best left unanswered. The new logo is a big departure with a fun and dynamic wordmark that cleverly, if a little forcefully, embeds a lightning bolt in the “B” amidst an italic sans serif (that appears to use <a href="https://www.schick-toikka.com/chap" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chap</a> as a foundation).</p>

<p>Without the quirkiness of Chap&#8217;s “e” and “a”, the bolt “B” might not have worked as it has too many angles and too many curves going in too many directions but the “e” and “a” provide the right balance of contrasting features to make the “B” look normal. There is also a nice flow in he “eta” trio with the customized curved endings. I&#8217;m not sure if I completely buy the relevance of a lightning bolt for an online betting company — I also keep thinking of battery brand, <a href="https://www.google.com/search?sca_esv=5eda41d0b524b30a&#038;sca_upv=1&#038;sxsrf=ADLYWIKMpUshbs0c_fVBLNQj-v2h34dQ1w:1724234714690&#038;q=rayovac+logo&#038;udm=2&#038;fbs=AEQNm0DfIOrc-JVK7JSIXTRypzh1d0Xgc-Qx-MWluXtsBh8oLqezDGS-GBRoVhGkujFN9L89G8OpQ_4dZf-PrNf_f2qsBtQmtLqsm6yxAHTedliasJBB9FQSsYwZnyPqqc5ldCsnkGqLbFClqXddPoG99GG8FOnDSp-qlZzIkKjMKkP9CcmcXuDZxiWgaR1I6cT030OuyH9GGaehPhQtpHoYO4976gklqg&#038;sa=X&#038;ved=2ahUKEwi3wLbt6oWIAxXFMtAFHdNbEN0QtKgLegQIFBAB&#038;biw=1299&#038;bih=1093&#038;dpr=2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rayovac</a> — but I do appreciate that it&#8217;s a broad enough concept of energy and excitement that encompasses completely different forms of betting (sports and casino-style games). The logo is a bit of an acquired taste but I do like it.</p>

<blockquote>Avoiding generic stock photography that dominates the sector, the Betano illustration suite injects personality across the brand. We commissioned Ed McGowan to create an illustration style depicting characters and players in surreal scenarios, blending sportsbook and casino iconography in unique ways.</blockquote><h3><a href="https://www.nomadstudio.com/work/betano" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nomad project page</a></h3>

<p>Driving the identity is <a href="https://mass-driver.com/typefaces/md-nichrome/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MD Nichrome</a>, with its funky width shifts in different characters. It&#8217;s somehow a great complement and contrast to the italic wordmark and helps expand the loose and fun vibe hinted at by the logo. The illustrations by <a href="https://www.instagram.com/parkopolo/?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ed McGowan</a> are groovy and I like the unconventional approach of white strokes on dark backgrounds and how they mix in gradients in the different objects to make the humans (and sasquatches) stand out — also, is that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ultimate_Warrior" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Ultimate Warrior</a> with the sasquatch? Legend. Add in the graphics for the various online casino games and things get a little chaotic but, still, a fun combination of elements.</p>

<blockquote>Whether placing a $5 bet to transform a dreary kickoff into a major showdown or hitting the jackpot on your final free spin, Betano adds a dash of excitement to the everyday. Born from the logo’s lightning bolt icon, the patterns and graphic language  create a flexible brand system that energises every touchpoint across the brand.</blockquote><h3><a href="https://www.nomadstudio.com/work/betano" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nomad project page</a></h3>

<p>The bolt serving as a foundation to create an angled underlying grid on which larger bolts can be drawn on to frame imagery and messaging is pretty great. It&#8217;s both simple to execute and fun to look at in the resulting compositions that can adapt to to any ratio. The identity does have the very difficult task of having to work appropriately with both serious football (and other sports) photography as well as with video-game-like graphics that are mostly visually bonkers and, amazingly, it manages to do so in both cases, making the sports photography more exciting and taming the game graphics by using the bolts to literally keep them in place while MD Nichrome holds its own against the wild lettering.</p>

<blockquote>As an official global partner of Euro 2024 and Copa América 2024, and a sponsor for sports teams big and small around the world, the new Betano logo was designed with the brand’s primary marketing strategies in mind. We created the logo to light up stadium LEDs on the biggest stage and to serve as a jersey sponsor that fans are proud to wear, from the stadium to the streets.</blockquote><h3><a href="https://www.nomadstudio.com/work/betano" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nomad project page</a></h3>

<p>Additionally, the logo also has to look corporate enough to live on jerseys and stadium graphics as a sponsor, it has to look as serious as bank or airline logos; and it has to not look completely out of place in these instances. Once more, this identity succeeds. Bonus points for the glitchy bolt pattern animations.</p>
