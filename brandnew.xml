                                            <p><strong>Relevant quote</strong><br /><em>Transitioning to the José Andrés Group symbolized a pivotal moment in this strategy, marking a shift that aimed to capture the essence of José’s impact more accurately. This move was informed by a desire to articulate a brand that is as dynamic and multifaceted as José himself, capable of inspiring and uniting people around the power of food.<br /><br />The revitalized brand identity, incorporating the dual exclamation marks (¡!), reflects José’s vibrant spirit and homage to his Spanish roots. This design choice, alongside the collaboration with music producer Javier Limón for an audio logo, infused the brand with a sense of energy and innovation.<br /><br />A collaboration with typographer Jordi Embodas led to the creation of a bespoke typeface that melds the elegance and activism at the heart of José’s brand. This typeface is named Mieres, after José’s hometown, and serves as a visual representation of the brand’s commitment to creativity, community, and change.<br /><br />The brand’s refreshed visual language, anchored by the dynamic double exclamation marks, signifies the brand’s adaptability and its mission to engage and inspire across diverse platforms. The use of vibrant colors, dynamic typography, and strategic imagery crafts a narrative that’s both compelling and inclusive.

                                            <p><strong>Opinion</strong><br />
                                            The old logo had a lot going on with far too many words to deal with and the addition of what looked like an egg with a battery or wi-fi signal indicator was weird and unnecessary (although I admit I may be missing some obvious or at least relevant connection to chef Andrés). The new logo is instantly more fun thanks to the double exclamation points and bright blue color. The wordmark is set in the identity's custom typeface designed by <a href="https://www.tipografies.com/custom/#mieres" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jordi Embodas</a>, which is a pretty nice, angular serif.<span></span> The logo can get increasingly small, down to only the pair of exclamation points and the “¡JA!” version serves as the foundation for the excellent audio mnemonic by <a href="https://javierlimon.net/" target="_blank">Javier Limón</a> — it works particularly well because “Ja” in Spanish is the equivalent of “Ha” in English to express laughter in written form. The identity builds on the serif typeface, which also comes in a stencil style for some additional texture. There is not much in actual application but, overall, this strikes a good balance of portraying the business side and food empire breadth of the group while also conveying the bold, loud, and engaging personality of chef Andrés.</p>

                                            <p>For the third week in a row we have a trio of restaurants — I promise the 502 edition will not be restaurants — with work from Paris, Brooklyn, and Bordeaux.</p>

<h1 class="friday_likes">La Plage du Martinez by Violaine &amp; Jérémy</h1>
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/friday_likes_la_plage.jpg" alt="La Plage du Martinez by Violaine &amp; Jérémy" />

<p style="margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;"><a href="https://www.hyatt.com/en-US/hotel/france/hotel-martinez/jcagh/dining/la-plage" target="_blank" rel="noopener">La Plage du Martinez</a> is the Jean Imbert-led restaurant, beach club, and bar of Hotel Martinez, which dominates the Promenade de la Croisette and is one of the most sought-after destinations in Cannes. The identity, designed by Paris, France-based <a href="https://www.behance.net/violaineetjeremy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Violaine &amp; Jérémy</a>, takes subtle cues from the film industry&#8217;s influence on Cannes and introduces a series of badges that look like film production logos from the 1920s and ’30s and that are peppered throughout the various menus of the establishment. The primary menu is designed like a vintage movie poster but instead of Cary Grant front and center, it&#8217;s a lovely hand-drawn illustration of la Croisette, accompanied by an unsurprisingly beautiful script wordmark. I say “unsurprising” because this level of craft is what we&#8217;ve come to expect from Violaine &amp; Jérémy projects — it also always helps that the production budget on their restaurant projects allows for some delightful materials and high-end printing. <span class="pagination_divider"></span><span class="small_caps"><a href="https://www.behance.net/gallery/200623369/La-Plage-Hotel-Martinez" target="_blank" rel="noopener">See full project</a></span></p>

<h1 class="friday_likes">Rio by Polonsky &amp; Friends</h1>
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/friday_likes_rio.jpg" alt="Rio by Polonsky &amp; Friends" />

<p style="margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;"><a href="https://www.instagram.com/rio.cafe.restaurant/?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rio</a> is an all-day café and restaurant in Montevideo, Uruguay. The identity, designed by Brooklyn, NY-based <a href="https://www.polonskyandfriends.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Polonsky &amp; Friends</a>, plays on the double meaning of the word “río” in Spanish that can translate into both “river” and “I laugh” by combining wavy lines in different applications (be it coasters or plates) and a wordmark with a sense of humor that can be deployed all jumbled up or in a more serious, straightforward setting. I really like how with only three letters, each one is subtly different, going from an uppercase sans serif to lowercase to an ambiguously-cased serif. A bonus pair of sun and moon icons make sporadic appearances and the color palette that ranges from a bright brown to a vibrant yellow has an optimistic vibe. <a href="https://www.instagram.com/rio.cafe.restaurant/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Their Instagram account</a> is full of additional looks at the applications (and delicious-looking food). <span class="pagination_divider"></span><span class="small_caps"><a href="https://www.polonskyandfriends.com/graphics/rio" target="_blank" rel="noopener">See full project</a></span>

<h1 class="friday_likes">Panaille by Abmo</h1>
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/friday_likes_panaille.jpg" alt="Panaille by Abmo" />

<p style="margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:30px!important;"><a href="https://www.instagram.com/panaille_bordeaux/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Panaille</a> is small restaurant in Bordeaux, France, offering a weekly rotating menu. The identity, designed local firm <a href="https://www.abmo.fr/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Abmo</a> — making a back-to-back Friday Likes appearance — revolves around a great, hand-painted logo, done by <a href="https://www.instagram.com/arthur.alazard/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Arthur Alazard</a>, delivered on a haphazard baseline that adds to its personality and playfulness. I just now noticed that the brown and yellow hues chosen for this project are very similar to the ones in Rio above… perhaps we just unlocked the hip color combo of 2024. The brush-y wordmark is paired with a condensed serif and sans serif and some black and white photography that give it a slight punk-band-flyer aesthetic. This project also makes me realize that, as an industry, we need more light fixture applications. <span class="pagination_divider"></span><span class="small_caps"><a href="https://www.behance.net/gallery/200689663/Panaille-Restaurant" target="_blank" rel="noopener">See full project</a></span></p>

                                            <p><strong>Opinion</strong><br />
                                            The old name was fairly descriptive and the overly corporate look clarified, in a way, that these were corporate showroom markets and not open-air or farmers markets. The old icon was kind of cool with its chiseled, weaved design but it definitely looked like the evil corporation in a movie. The new name and logo are more playful and engaging if also more abstract. I like the idea behind “And More” to convey the notion of more space, more opportunities, more of everything but when written all in uppercase — not in the logo but in actual copywriting — it becomes stiff and starts to lose its original intention. I also keep reading the name as if I was Dean Martin singing “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnFlx2Lnr9Q" target="_blank">That’s Amore</a>” but I accept that that may just be a case of the way my brain is wired and not a universal association.<span></span> The logo is quite good, with the “O” scaled up and ending up like a pair of parenthesis, further playing on the concept of “more” (as you usually put more stuff within parentheses as I am doing here). The tight letter-spacing and extra bold typeface have a fun 1960s-70s vibe… as well as being similar to COLLINS' 2021 <a href="https://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/new_logo_and_identity_for_next_insurance_by_collins.php" target="_blank">identity for Next</a>. In application, the “O” naturally and seamlessly opens up to accommodate messaging or imagery, which works particularly well in the advertising sample where silhouetted globes are embedded in “M( )RE”. I'm on the fence regarding the supporting thin monospace typeface… I like the thinness and differentiation from the big bold sans serif logo and headlines but it also feels out of place or like it's trying too hard to add some hipness to the identity. Overall, this strikes a good balance of being corporate and business-minded but also having a touch of design-y playfulness to attract the various furniture, decor, and fashion brands and products that end up inhabiting their spaces.</p>

Built by Airbnb and Snowflake alums after realizing that no software in the commercial landscape provided the power of experimentation systems they were used to and the belief that A/B experimentation has one of the clearest relationships to revenue ROI, Eppo is built for today&#8217;s product teams and the modern data stack, making advanced A/B testing accessible to everyone in an organization. Recently, Eppo introduced a new identity designed by <a href="https://movingbrands.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Moving Brands</a>.</p>

<blockquote>Our approach started with uncovering what makes Eppo unique: its statistical rigor, trust in its science and people, and ability to create a culture where employees feel comfortable bringing new ideas to the table. We then focused on the customer and found what united them—their ability to transform their organizations. Together, these findings helped us define Eppo as Transformational Leaders—those who have an experimental mindset, eager to challenge the status quo and jettison standard ways of working.</blockquote><h3><a href="https://movingbrands.com/work/eppo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Moving Brands project page</a></h3>

<blockquote>Moving Brands approached Eppo’s identity design by leaning into the experimental mindset. They challenged us to “lean into the weird” and go beyond what any of us had made before. As a result we created a<br />
– logo made from modular shapes that shift and rearrange, becoming more intricate as they scale up; <br />
– color palette made from atypical colors and unusual pairings;<br />
– data visualizations that are unapologetically technical; and <br />
– graphic patterns made of blocks and linear forms that can be continuously experimented with to create a wealth of dynamic and inspiring expressions.</blockquote><h3><a href="https://movingbrands.com/work/eppo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Moving Brands project page</a></h3>

<p>The old logo was such a weird direction for what the company does… never in a million years would I have assumed that logo was for any kind of software, much less something so hardcore. A soap or shampoo brand? Sure. The icon was actually kind of nice with its petal-like shapes and I assume the two different colors in it were meant to convey the idea of A/B testing but, yeah, just a very odd match and the wordmark felt too outdated and very generic. The new logo is kind of wild and its almost-pixelated aesthetic is better aligned with their offering in that it at least now gives <em>digital</em>.<p>

<p>In its most basic and static form, it&#8217;s an acquired taste and arguably not a “great” logo given the awkward shapes that result from the removed notches but I do like the effect it has and, whether intentional or not, I like this interpretation of A/B testing in the “p”s with different pieces removed to “test” which “p” works better. Or maybe I&#8217;m reading way too much into it. The display and animated versions of the logo are even wilder and it&#8217;s somewhat remarkable that any client would go for something so weird and, to a degree, unreadable so props to them. The flat 3D motion is pretty slick and the various modular elements that flip and spin and rotate all continue to enhance this idea of searching for just the right combination of elements for things to work.</p>

<p>Doubling down on the experimental aesthetic, the graphics are super fun and I love the introduction of the grainy gradients to add some texture and dimensionality to the vector-heavy graphics. The choice of <a href="https://www.sharptype.co/typefaces/sharp-slab" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sharp Slab</a> is unexpected for the industry but it looks great on their website and it helps balance out the digital-y aesthetic with a slight editorial look. The diagrams are slick although a bit random and possibly remnants from a separate design route that were implemented into the crazier route. The diagrams&#8217; design and approach does extend to the rest of the identity in the form of thin-stroke modules, holding shapes, and other compositions that can be seen on their website.</p>

<blockquote>Through a series of dynamic workshops with Eppo team members and interviews with customers, we uncovered invaluable insights about the website&#8217;s role, specific use cases, and pivotal moments to amplify the new brand. Instead of just being a source of information and technical knowledge, the primary opportunity was to set the Eppo website apart by showcasing its product advantages for key audiences, and its distinctive influence on businesses via unique moments.</blockquote><h3><a href="https://movingbrands.com/work/eppo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Moving Brands project page</a></h3>

<blockquote>We were excited to deliver a brand system that the Eppo team could experiment with and reshape to suit the needs of a growing business. The graphic expressions, for example were designed to capture the concept of transformation through modular shapes that slot together in surprising ways. The brand assets we delivered can be remixed by the Eppo team using online generative tools to create unique ‘Experiment Editions’. The result of which is a brand that is iterative and alive.</blockquote><h3>Moving Brands provided text.</h3>
