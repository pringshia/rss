                                            <p>Devin Mathews, a designer and art director in Logan, UT, has recently launched SuprOrdinary, a YouTube series “about the extraordinary creative potential in the everyday ordinary”. In his first episode, he redesigns, for free, the identity for a local hole-in-the-wall sandwich shop but that ends up being the least interesting bit about this. I rarely sit through a whole YouTube video but these were some funny, touching, thoughtful, and beautifully shot and edited 17 minutes. The redesign is pretty nice too.

                                            <p><strong>Relevant quote</strong><br /><em>The goal was to design a system that can evolve from year to year, establishing a consistent and recognizable festival brand. To achieve this, the team developed a versatile, quirky, and sophisticated visual framework for the event series. The design draws inspiration from the British mod subculture, while also echoing the aesthetic of ’80s and ’90s poster art. The result is a bold yet refined structure that frames the film stills in a way that allows them to stand out, while contributing to a cohesive festival atmosphere.<br /><br />The STOKI team has crafted an identity built around a minimalist yet impactful color palette that subtly references the Union Jack – without ever using all three colors simultaneously – ensuring the visuals remain elegant and refined. While the core identity remains understated, the event’s color scheme introduces more vibrant tones, adding energy and a contemporary edge. The interaction between colors creates a dynamic rhythm and striking contrasts that naturally draw attention.<br /><br />Typography plays a central role in the identity, balancing modern feel with retro flair. Despite the presence of dynamic elements – such as warped text, running banners, and overlapping visuals – the overall design remains cohesive and intentional. Key features include bold typography, circular accents, slight rotations, italicized elements, and a vivid blue-red-white color combination, all working together to create a lively and rebellious visual language. The identity embraces visual experimentation with confidence, resulting in a striking, memorable aesthetic.

                                            <p><strong>Opinion</strong><br />
                                            The logo, which spells “Brit Filmnapok” (“British Film Days in Hungarian”) is as eccentric as it gets and the fullest manifestation of the <a href="https://www.future-fonts.com/" target="_blank">Future Fonts</a> aesthetic of weird, squiggly, extra ink-trap-y typography. (This might even be a Future Fonts font, not sure to be honest.) Depending on your affinity for this particular flavor of typography, you will probably love it or hate it. Despite having a bit of an expiration date that has already passed I can't help but like it. I do love me some exaggerated letterforms and to use that style to render a unicase wordmark tickles me more than I would like to admit. The one thing I don't get is the italicized “film”… not sure it was needed and it just adds noise to an already busy logo.<span></span> The curvaceous type is paired with a deadpan sans, the aptly named <a href="https://www.myfonts.com/collections/coolvetica-font-typodermic?refby=ucllc" target="_blank">Coolvetica</a>, along with some early-2000s-trendy stroked ovals and angled typography. Again, I like it more than I should. The identity sticks with Coolvetica but throws in a stylistic set that gives the “t” an extra long arm and the “y” a bowl-shaped approach, which might be one typographic quirk too many, especially as it clashes so awkwardly with the regular Coolvetica. It's like it's trying way too hard to exude the British mod vibe it set out to adopt.<span></span> The color combination can be grating but that's nothing new when mixing red and blue. The identity is at its best when it's only red, especially on film clips and moody photography and at its most confusing when it uses black, as it shifts the tone completely. Overall, this is clearly meant to be fun and loose although it can be confusing as to what the content and tone of the films shown might be — leaning more to <em>Austin Powers</em> farce than an actual British sensibility — so it might be too fun and loose for its own good yet still entertaining on a brief exposure to it.</p>

The company owns, operates, and franchises over 260 parks in 90 markets that welcome over 40 million guests a year — a combined attendance that at least prior to COVID, surpassed that of Six Flags and Disneyland — and its membership program counts with more than 350,000 members. Aside from trampolines, the parks offer a combined selection of over 60 different attractions like foam pits, slides, obstacle courses, basketball hoops, zip lines, and climbing walls and if you are a parent you have probably also ended up at (or hosted) a birthday party there. With increasing competition in the space, along with indoor amusement parks all looking the same, Sky Zone has, in an effort to reposition itself as the category leader, introduced a new identity designed by Atlanta, GA-based <a href="https://matchstic.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Matchstic</a>.</p>

<blockquote>The trampolines, obstacles, swings, and jumps are great, but the real magic is the overall family experience. At Sky Zone, there’s a balance between the spirit of the kids and the needs of the parents. We described this kind of play as “wildish.” That almost impossible dance that lets kids go wild while parents relax. It’s as wild as you can get while still staying safe.<br /><br />This is what makes Sky Zone special. Youthful but not childish. Controlled but not restrained. We took this tight-rope contradiction into the brand’s identity and made it their mantra.<br /><br /><strong>Play rules here.</strong></blockquote><h3><a href="https://matchstic.com/work/sky-zone" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Matchstic project page</a></h3>

<blockquote>The logo was evolved to be more functional, scalable, and simple. By reducing the elements, we worked together to create a tactile and toyetic “S” that pays homage to Sky Zone&#8217;s beginnings with trampolines, the original symbol that brought them 20 years of success.<br /><br />Actually, tactility inspired most of the visual and verbal identity. Assets, like the logo and typography, bounce, float, and swing as though they were in the park. The colors, orange and blue, were expanded to support play as something imaginative yet sophisticated.</blockquote><h3><a href="https://matchstic.com/work/sky-zone" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Matchstic project page</a></h3>

<p>The old logo was bad, slapping on the “SZ” initials onto a trampoline grid and skewing the two un-integrated elements into a weird, exaggerated perspective. The accompanying wordmark was no better and it appears it was horizontally stretched. The new logo is a huge improvement, starting with the simplified “S” monogram that takes the same trampoline grid idea to cleverly shape the letter and I absolutely love how the individual squares (and quarter-circles) in the “S” pinch towards the center as if someone was landing on the trampoline and creating that ever-so-fun tension right before being hurtled back into the air. The wordmark is still not the most exciting, which is fine as the monogram fulfills that task, but it is now at least an appropriately wide sans serif in an extra wide width that maintains a nice tie-in to the old identity.</p>

<blockquote>Even Sky Zone&#8217;s verbal identity has this playful energy. In the brand headlines, we made the back and forth between kids and adults literal. A bold sans serif embodies the wild and spirited tone of our inner child, while the funky serif typeface (our adult voice) pulls us back. The result is a fun and playful interplay between our guests and the brand. It’s messaging that showcases the fun rather than explaining it— all with little to no puns.</blockquote><h3><a href="https://matchstic.com/work/sky-zone" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Matchstic project page</a></h3>

<p>The identity introduces two new typefaces that go perfectly together and are a fun, conceptual manifestation of the dynamic at these indoor trampoline places that while built for kids, these kids still need to be driven there and overseen by an adult, so the two have to co-exist. This is brought to life through <a href="https://commercialtype.com/catalog/platform" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Platform</a> and <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Besley" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Besley</a> to represent the kid and the adult respectively in the tone of voice, which is fun and clever. Outside the messaging, the two typefaces are a great one-two punch of serious fun, balancing yet again that all promos and communications have to appeal to kids but also give adults some peace of mind. The blue and orange combo is bold and striking and is put to good use throughout the identity — it also makes me think that this color combo may me a ploy from Big Fun to get us hooked from an early age as kids going to Sky Zone all the way through adulthood where we just transfer that same feeling and experience (and need for overstimulation) into <a href="https://www.daveandbusters.com/us/en/home" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dave and Buster&#8217;s</a>.</p>

<p>The in-park application of the identity is pretty great for what it is… which I don&#8217;t mean as an offense to Matchstic but most of these places are an unpleasant visual and aural cacophony so the fact that these are even remotely “elegant” is quite a feat. The big yet simple typography on the walls is a great contrast to the actual physical craziness of the different attractions and the whole blue, orange, and black color palette works amazingly well as it explodes into all the various sections of the park. The one thing I&#8217;m not sure of is the blue-to-orange gradient that make appearances here and there, which I realize is a small thing to nitpick but I think it takes away from the boldness and simplicity of the rest of the identity. The monotone 3D graphics are cool but maybe they could have been pushed a bit more in terms of texturing… I would have loved for them to be more foam-y somehow.</p>

<p class="end">Overall, this is a pretty great identity and a rare case where adults-designing-for-kids doesn&#8217;t turn into a “How do you do fellow kids?” situation. Also, I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m alone in this nor is it a hot take to say that these indoor trampoline places, for most adults, are like an amuse-bouche of Hell so any kind of effort to make this experience more palatable, bearable, and dare I say sophisticated is welcome and I think this identity elevates this very specific genre of entertainment to its most polished and thoughtful extreme.</p>

                                            <p>Milwaukee, WI-based wood artist Ike Wynter has recreated all 32 NFL logos by layering multiple pieces of reclaimed wood — over 50 pieces of furniture — from mundane items like old drawers, cabinets, doors, and more. The 3-foot-by-3-foot wooden pieces will be used in the upcoming NFL Draft (taking place in Milwaukee) as they will line the “Player Walkway”, the path each player who&#8217;s at the draft will take before hearing their name called on stage. The monotone approach, limited by the available wood finishes, to define the colors for each logo is pretty impressive.

Every year, the festival attracts over 100,000 spectators, who, when the lights go down, open themselves up to the magic of cinema – and cinema opens up to them. It’s a spring tradition that enriches and expands our horizons. But that’s just the beginning! Vilnius film festival is more than just a festival. It’s a distributor of auteur films, a creator of unforgettable summer events, and a major driver of the cinema industry. All of this together forms a CINEMA DISCOVERY PLATFORM – a place where great cinema is always within reach. For our audiences, we bring films from the world’s top international festivals. For talented filmmakers, we offer recognition. For the industry, new partnerships. And for our partners, a chance to reach new audiences.&#8221;</p>

                                            <p><strong>Relevant quote</strong><br /><em>As Kino Pavasaris expanded beyond traditional cinema spaces into digital platforms and everyday screens, it required a flexible yet recognizable visual identity that could seamlessly adapt to different formats. A key aspect of this transformation was the introduction of a visual categorization system, designed to help audiences navigate the festival’s diverse film selection while maintaining an emotional connection to cinema. This new identity also needed to integrate cohesively across all festival materials—from big-screen animations and citywide posters to digital banners and volunteer branding—ensuring a unified and lasting brand presence.<br /><br />The rebrand positioned Kino Pavasaris as a cinema discovery platform, where film is always within reach. At its core, the eye-shaped logo embodies the festival’s promise of "eye-opening cinema" - its animation reinforces this, revealing additional graphic elements as the eye opens, mirroring how cinema expands perception. The color system categorizes films while capturing the emotional imprint of cinema itself - each color is taken from real movie frames, seen as if through half-closed eyes, blending together like a lingering memory. Just as a great film leaves behind not a single moment but a lasting feeling, these colors evoke the way cinema stays with us beyond the screen. The combination of serif and minimalist typefaces creates a refined contrast that enhances clarity across all platforms, maintaining a balance between visual character and readability. This rebrand marks the beginning of a cohesive visual identity—one that will no longer change annually but will remain consistent, reinforcing the festival’s place in the cultural landscape.

                                            I'm going to have to admit ignorance and say that I am not sure what the star shape in the old logo was. What I do know is that embedding a film strip into it did not yield the most pleasant composition and instead was a rather busy and fuzzy graphic device. The typography next to it, while not bad was not good either as its spacing was all over the place across the four lines and within each word. The new logo adopts a more universal symbol of an eye but is heavily abstracted in a way that moves beyond what could have been a cliché and instead hints at the idea of an eye with its two tapered curves that bluntly end in a straight line. I like that, intentionally or unintentionally, they look like those <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=film+festival+selection+logo&amp;sca_esv=96a40c3d46737ee5&amp;udm=2&amp;biw=1527&amp;bih=1068&amp;sxsrf=AHTn8zoj7gvSCWLqUFuSB7rH7lmmpsF3Ig%3A1744711965509&amp;ei=HTH-Z6_oHqX9ptQPkK-ZmAo&amp;oq=film+festival+selectio&amp;gs_lp=EgNpbWciFmZpbG0gZmVzdGl2YWwgc2VsZWN0aW8qAggAMgUQABiABDIFEAAYgAQyBBAAGB4yBBAAGB4yBhAAGAUYHjIGEAAYBRgeMgYQABgFGB4yBhAAGAUYHjIGEAAYBRgeMgYQABgFGB5IvhhQ2glYsxFwAngAkAEBmAHqAaABzQeqAQU0LjMuMbgBA8gBAPgBAZgCCaACnQfCAgoQABiABBhDGIoFwgIGEAAYBxgemAMAiAYBkgcFNS4zLjGgB4Q2sgcFMy4zLjG4B5QH&amp;sclient=img" target="_blank">“Official Selection” laurel-wreath-wrapped logos</a> used in festivals around the world but, obviously, rotated. Even though I wish the typography within was something a little more interesting than Helvetica, it's an appropriate choice that works perfectly well.<span></span> The identity gets a little more funky with the introduction of a fuzzy green and blue gradient motif that is sometimes used as a background or sometimes as a halo effect for the logo and typography, while a black and white foundation of photography serves to offset the color. While the logo seems to be using Helvetica (or one of its closer ilk), the identity turns to <a href="https://abcdinamo.com/typefaces/monument-grotesk" target="_blank">Monument Grotesk</a>, which has a little more flair to it and is paired with the condensed width of <a href="https://liptonletterdesign.com/fonts/meno-display/" target="_blank">Meno Display</a> for a classic yet, somehow, edgy combo as the two come together. The “30 Years of Life in Cinema” lock-up with the logo wedged in there is quite nice. There is another funky type treatment for the “Eyes Wide Open” line that is fun to look at but maybe feels like a straggler from another design route that found its way here but I'm not mad about it as it looks great on the t-shirt. Overall, this is a simple and bold identity that effortlessly captures and conveys a film festival aesthetic.</p>

Simply put, they restore ecosystems by leveraging the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_offsets_and_credits" target="_blank" rel="noopener">carbon credits</a> of trusted investors worldwide. The company&#8217;s environmental assets include over 437,000 hectares, with plans for more than 5 million additional hectares. They have issued 4.1 million carbon credits to date, delivering measurable benefits for biodiversity, local communities, and investors. Recently, in support of a broader campaign, Forest Carbon launched a new logo and identity designed by the Singapore office of <a href="https://www.designbridge.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Design Bridge and Partners.</a></p>

<p>There&#8217;s not much to say about the old logo, as there wasn&#8217;t much to it. Typeset in a rather neutral sans serif, in rather neutral colors, it did display a degree of typographic sensitivity about the alignment of the letters in the two stacked words, but it didn&#8217;t have much concept or character to speak of. The new wordmark is still using an all-caps, stacked arrangement of the two words but is otherwise very different, primarily because it&#8217;s using a serif typeface with lots of custom ligatures. The ligatures connect the letters both left to right and top to bottom. And while all this customization of the letterforms is verging on being overdone, in general I think it&#8217;s a handsome logo and I like the concept that it evokes organic, growing things, as well as the sonic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernst_Chladni" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chladni patterns</a> that are at the heart of the system.</p> 

<blockquote>
The design system wasn’t merely inspired by nature; it was created from the sounds of nature itself. Working with our concept “In Tune with Nature”, we translated the symphony of a thriving forest into an impactful visual language that gives nature a voice.
<br><br />
The dynamic Forest Carbon identity visualises the tangible progress of restoration and conservation, illuminating the vibrant chorus of life and its holistic impact on biodiversity, local communities, and the environment. Inspired by bioacoustics and Chladni figures—visual representations of sound frequencies—the identity reflects the richness of a healthy ecosystem.

<blockquote>
To ensure scientific integrity, we consulted bioacoustics researchers, gaining insights that led to the development of a custom software based on real-world algorithms. This tool simulates digital Chladni figures &#8211; intriguing nodal patterns that appear on a surface when it vibrates in response to sound waves. We used the tool to translate sound recordings of Southeast Asian species into unique Chladni patterns that reflect their individual frequencies.

<p>As an expression of the idea that a healthy ecosystem is full of natural sounds, the patterns are maybe a bit esoteric — most people won&#8217;t recognize them as graphic representations of sounds. However, I don&#8217;t know that that really matters. In videos, the motion of the patterns paired with their source sounds is especially nice, and conceptually more apparent. But even as static graphics, they evoke organic life: cellular forms, reptile scales, ripples in water, etc. So even when this uniquely sonic identity isn&#8217;t so sonic, I think it&#8217;s still quite distinct, compelling, and appropriately deployed. If I have any misgivings with it, it&#8217;s when the patterns affect typography, which doesn&#8217;t look bad per se, I just wonder how necessary it is.</p>

<p>Looking at the rest of the system, the logo&#8217;s typeface, also used for headlines, is <a href="https://michaelrafailyk.com/quietism" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Quietism</a> by Michael Rafailyk — a font name that is either incredibly on the nose or ironically in contrast to the brand&#8217;s central concept. I really can&#8217;t decide. It has an old-fashioned <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiqua_(typeface_class)" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Antiqua</a> style, but with lots of quirky details and exaggerated curvilinear and calligraphic forms that jibe well with the graphic patterns as well as evoking regional written languages. Paired with it is <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/IBM+Plex+Mono" target="_blank" rel="noopener">IBM Plex Mono</a>, which offers a technical, scientific sensibility that makes sense. The colors are a bit on the trendy side for my taste but it&#8217;s hard to argue with them being inspired by the vibrant wildlife of the environments they&#8217;re protecting. Additionally, there is a rather undefined icon system that also references the Chladni patterns and at least in part is meant to label the species&#8217; degrees of endangerment. Other icons appear here and there, but their definitions aren&#8217;t clear, so it&#8217;s hard to say those are particularly successful or useful.</p>

<p>In application, there&#8217;s no real surprises, but the system is used consistently and with a nice degree of restraint. If the video of the interface that generates the graphic patterns reflects a real tool, that is a great addition to the toolkit, and it&#8217;s easy to imagine how that will be useful in the long term for the brand. As noted earlier, I&#8217;d like to see more definition around the icons. It&#8217;s also surprising there&#8217;s no indication of standards for data visualization given the scientific aspect of their mission. But there is some nice looking data viz in the digital dashboard video, so hopefully those standards do exist, or those examples at least provide a useful precedent to follow.</p>

Indeed, divorced from the imagery of wildlife, it starts to feel a bit too much like the identity for a museum or cultural institution (it&#8217;s hard not to think of the logo for <a href="https://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/new_logo_and_identity_for_the_met_by_wolff_olins.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Met</a>). Then again, there&#8217;s no mandate for organizations such as this to leverage a familiar vernacular, so I applaud their attempt to branch out and their commitment to the sonic concept, if it proves to connect with their audiences at scale, should keep them looking and sounding fresh in the long term.</p>
