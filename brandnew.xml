Our mission is to provide innovative alternatives to fast-furniture, that are so good people will want to change. See we prefer the carrot to the stick, because there are plenty of opportunities to make a difference. And being more circular shouldn’t feel like settling for less. On the contrary. So we partner with high quality furniture producers that create the items you’ll want in your spaces (because we think they’d look great in ours).&#8221;</p>

Their client base was solid, but their offerings were cluttered. They were ready to add second-hand furniture to their catalogue but needed a fresh pair of eyes to find focus. After four years of operation and many iterations, their identity and communications were all over the place.<br /><br />We worked closely with the team, listening to their ambitions and understanding their daily challenges. This allowed us to help Enky reflect on their priorities and connect their expansion goals to a sharper, more focused offering. Together, we clarified their brand, put strategy at the heart of their business and decision-making, and equipped them with an identity designed to stand out.

                                            <p><strong>Opinion</strong><br />
                                            Based on old and new logos, one thing is clear… the client is not afraid of approving quirky logos, which is not to say either was or is great but they certainly had and have personality. The old one, in a unicase approach, embraced a geometric construction and used only full circles and 0-, 45-, and 90-degree strokes. The result was a little clunky but commendable. The new logo maintains that same geometric rigor but with a less mechanical approach in favor of a slightly more human touch thanks to the thicker strokes and lowercase setting. The “e” ends up being a little awkward as well as being the letter with the smallest “body mass” so it ends up feeling a little left out and the “k” becomes the more dominant letter. Nonetheless, it has a bold presence and a design-y enough aesthetic to help sell design-y furniture.<span></span> The identity doubles down on the Bauhaus-esque construction of the logo with the choice of <a href="https://extraset.ch/typefaces/build/" target="_blank">ES Build</a>, which removes the stems from letters that have them and that features heavily circular letterforms. Aside from the intended “circular” nature of the company that aims to give furniture more life beyond a single use, I am told that “Enky” means “circular” in ancient Greek, which I was not able to corroborate but further explains all the circular graphic motifs. The few applications shown all look fine if a little dry and unexciting but the furniture imagery is nice enough to make things a little more interesting. The one cool design trick is the radiating silhouettes emanating from isolated, spinning furniture… the identity could use more of that energy both in digital and print as the effect could look nice blown up and used as a large background graphic. Overall, a safe identity with enough of <a href="https://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/new_logo_and_identity_for_herman_miller_by_order.php" target="_blank">a Herman Miller-esque</a> vibe that should help attract the corporate clientele Enky is initially setting out to reach.</p>

                                            <p>Launched in 2022, <a href="https://eatcrunchits.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Crunchits</a> is a brand of high-protein savory snacks made with rice, edamame, and black beans to form rugged clusters that are then “Blasted with flavour” and “Packed with crunch”. Created by London, UK-based The Savourists, which was founded by Harry Turpin in 2019 and has been innovating in the savory snacks category, Crunchits come in two flavors: Fiery Chilli and Sticky Teriyaki. Aside from being high in protein, they are high in fiber, vegan, have no sugar added, and are HFSS-compliant (high in fat, sugar or salt) with each 25g pack coming in under 100 guilt-free calories. As Crunchits aims to continue its mission to shake up the healthy snacking game, it has introduced a new identity and packaging designed by London-based <a href="https://studioearthling.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Earthling Studio</a>.</p>

<blockquote>The croc icon was inspired by a combination of our ‘rough around the edges’ positioning, the onomatopoeic nature of the brand name and the knobbly appearance of the product itself.<br /><br />This unusual combo led the creative team at Earthling to create something truly unique and distinctly memorable for the brand… a gold-toothed croc (which doubles as a letter ‘C’), calmly circling its prey and ready to CRUNCH.”</blockquote><h3>Earthling Studio provided text</h3>

<p>The old packaging barely had what one would call a logo as the type treatment for the flavor blended into the Crunchits product name in the same typeface and there was much more visual impact and hierarchy given to the flavor that the recurring logo barely registered. Compound that with the addition of the parent company logo and Crunchits didn&#8217;t quite have a chance to make a name for itself. The new packaging, which we will get to further down below, makes room for a proper logo that can now also exist outside of the packaging and adapt to other applications easily and without fear of it getting lost as I can&#8217;t imagine the old “logo” being able to hold its own.</p>

<p>As the new face of the product, the logo introduces a crocodile with a golden tooth that signals some level of street-level experience and a hardened life from the things it has seen. Its drawing by <a href="https://www.instagram.com/begoodstudio/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Luke Harrison</a> — forming a “C” to boot — is excellent and completely unique. There is no real precedent for a crocodile as a brand ambassador… and, yes, I see you all “But Lacoste” advocates but a grungy crocodile for a snack brand is not a typical element in the kit of parts most CPG brands go for. In other words, I dig it.</p>

<p>The croc is accompanied by some fun, scraggly typography drawn by <a href="https://robclarke.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rob Clarke</a>, using <a href="https://londontype.co.uk/project/ldn-whitechapel-sans/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LDN Whitechapel</a> as the foundation, and it&#8217;s excellent as well with a proper construction optimized for wrapping around a circle… like, the way the bowl of the “R” shoots out almost ahead of its leg is a perfect way of giving the “R” some forward momentum and fill in that top space. The “N” and “H” taper from wider tops to narrower bottoms to fill in that top space better too and the horizontal stroke of the “T” also has the right curvature to it. My only complaint would be the initial “C” that feels just a tad small but, yeah, it&#8217;s an excellent logo all around.</p>

</figure>

<p>The parent company also got a nice evolution to match the rugged look of Crunchits and while the old logo was fine, this one feels much more in tune with the types of products it has created and, in particular with Crunchits. The new logo isn&#8217;t particularly original… that kind of industrial holding shape with condensed type inside is a well-worn trope but with good reason. It works.</p>

<p>The old packaging was actually pretty decent in terms of shelf presence and conveying that the product was packed with flavor but its hierarchy was definitely all over the place and the paint smears were, perhaps, not the most appetizing. The new packaging is perfectly balanced now, with the product brand taking center stage and showcasing a photo of it right in the middle of the logo, which is such a great detail and such a great activation of the logo and its integration unto the bag. The flavors are now much smaller but stand out so well in their respective holding shapes — a flame-y one for Fiery Chilli and a gooey one for Sticky Teriyaki. These are balanced with a clear and fun description of what exactly is in the bag: “Rugged Rice Clusters”. For both elements, the supporting type, <a href="https://www.myfonts.com/collections/bike-jam-font-pizzadudedk?refby=ucllc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PizzaDude.dk&#8217;s Bike Jam</a>, in a blocky, hand-drawn aesthetic is a great complement to the Crunchits logo AND the Savourists logo, fitting in through attitude more so than by being a perfect visual match.</p>

<p class="end">The rest of the applications are all quite satisfying and engaging, putting to good use the new range of identity elements by mixing and matching them in fun and engaging ways, whether it&#8217;s the type on its own, the type and the parent company together, the flavor holding shapes, the croc… they can all work independently or coexist. Overall, this is a robust new identity that is a huge upgrade in design and attitude that arms Crunchits  with more distinctive assets and a better shot at standing out as its own brand.</p>

The event&#8217;s goal is to promote talented musicians with international potential, providing them with the space to grow and expand onto the global music market. This initiative evolves in line with the trends and needs of the contemporary music landscape, with music at its core, shaping its identity.” The first Music Week Poland will take place in Warsaw from June 26 to June 29, 2025.</p>

                                            <p><strong>Relevant quote</strong><br /><em>The logo design draws inspiration from the concept of a network and hub a place where diverse elements come together and amplify one another, capturing the essence of connection and collaboration at the heart of the festival. It also references the image of a soundwave, a universal symbol of music that reflects its variability, diversity, and dynamism. Just as music continuously evolves and adapts, the design mirrors the energy of the festival as a space that fosters artistic development and helps gain wider recognition, offering a dynamic environment for both performers and industry professionals. The emblem features the monogram M + W, representing the initials of the festival's name.<br /><br />The logo also forms the basis for the Key Visual, which, through its simplicity, offers flexibility and potential for further development in future editions of the festival. Its universal nature allows for various adaptations and modifications, ensuring visual coherence while providing the flexibility to evolve with future needs.

                                            <p><strong>Opinion</strong><br />
                                            Sound wave-meets-music is one of the most common graphic-meets-concept pairings in the design industry so it's rare to be surprised by it. This isn't a jaw-dropping surprise but the translation of the “M” and “W” pair as a ligature built into a sound wave is somewhat original and the motion execution where the thickness can shift towards the “M” or the “W” is fairly satisfying. I'm on the fence about the execution of the curved exterior corners contrasted by the sharp angles on the interior corners… I think it helps with readability to distinguish the “M” from the “W” but I wonder if there was any other potential way of drawing the turns in a more streamlined manner. Still, very much digging the monogram. The wordmark, typeset in <a href="https://www.myfonts.com/collections/patron-font-milieu-grotesque?refby=ucllc" target="_blank">Patron</a> is fine but perhaps too dry for a music festival.<span></span> In application, the monogram is extended into a graphic device that can expand and function in different ways, from a pattern, to a holding shape, to a background graphic. It's simple and effective if a little repetitive and where I feel like a more interesting typographic choice than Patron could have helped add another visual element to play with and take some responsibility off of the sound wave, which has to do all the heavy lifting. To its credit, it does it very well, particularly in motion. Overall, while this could be for a music week event anywhere in the world — point being, I wish there was something that anchored this to Poland a little more overtly — it's a fun, engaging, and dynamic identity.</p>

<blockquote>Our work on this project was guided by several key objectives, each presenting its own set of challenges that demanded creative and strategic solutions. One of the primary goals was to craft a brand identity that seamlessly balanced two seemingly contrasting qualities: being approachable, conversational, and warm while also embodying the rigor and credibility of a scientifically proven method.<br /><br />To achieve this, we focused on blending elevated photography, animation, and thoughtful typography. This combination was carefully designed to evoke a sense of cleanliness and professionalism that reinforces the brand’s scientific credibility. At the same time, it maintains a warm, familiar, and personable tone, reflecting the approachable personality and vision of the founder, Mila Magnani.</blockquote><h3><a href="https://parker.studio/work/milamend" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Parker project page</a></h3>

<figcaption>Monogram animation.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The old logo, in what appears to have been either a customized treatment of <a href="https://www.sharptype.co/typefaces/ogg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ogg</a> or an Ogg impersonator, had the right idea in the typographic choice being elegant and with a soft touch but, unless I am missing something obvious, it emphasized the wrong letters. Like, why highlight “ila”? Either “Mila” (for the owner&#8217;s name) or “mend” (for mending the body) would have made more sense. Nonetheless, it wasn&#8217;t bad by most standards. The new logo shifts from the more popular and trendy Ogg to a customized treatment of <a href="https://klim.co.nz/retail-fonts/tiempos-headline/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tiempos Headline</a> for a more mature and upscale presence. The “LA” ligature is lovely and other than the difficult space between the “A” and the “M”, the spacing is quite nice. I wonder how many times they went back and forth between making the “AM” a ligature as well or not.</p>

<p>The monogram doesn&#8217;t play coy with the subject matter and directly references ovaries. As a man I don&#8217;t feel it is my place to assess, much less determine, whether visual representation of ovaries is appropriate or welcome in the context of women&#8217;s health supplements but as a designer I can confidently tell you that this is a very nice monogram, handling the twists and turns quite effectively. I think some of the places where the lines overlap could have used with slightly gooey-er shadows in key places to further emphasize the volume of the lines as they weave one on top of the other. The two elements make for a handsome pair with a nice visual contrast between them but with a shared, elegant sensibility.</p>

<blockquote>The Parker team produced, shot, and art-directed a series of still-life photoshoots to elevate the product and give it the glow-up it deserved. With the drink’s naturally beautiful color, we aimed to closely integrate it with the brand’s color palette, creating a cohesive and visually striking body of content for the launch.</blockquote><h3>Parker provided text</h3>

<figcaption>Product photography.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Leading the identity is the product photography that takes advantage of the absolutely delightful orange-red tone of the powder once it&#8217;s mixed in, looking like a perfect prop for the primary Instagram- and TikTok-based audience. Slight social commentary swipe aside, it really is a lovely tone and presenting it in fancy, cocktail-like glassware elevates it from mere supplement to a treat or almost a guilty pleasure, making the product more covetable and lifestyle-influenced. As someone with no patience to mix powdered supplements in anything beyond a regular glass and spinning it as fast as I can with a spoon that invariably leaves gunk on the sides of the glass, I&#8217;ll admit that these images are actually somewhat aspirational to me.</p>

<blockquote>We implemented a series of lifelike yet surreal renders to breathe more life into the brand, emphasizing the “elevating” nature of the product. The digital experience complements this with a series of blurs and soft animations, keeping the experience lighthearted and hopeful.</blockquote><h3><a href="https://parker.studio/work/milamend" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Parker project page</a></h3>

<figcaption>Blurs.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The other graphic highlight of the project is a series of blurred shapes that also take a cue from the color of the mixed powder and yield some lovely textures and hypnotic overlays. The “surreal” photography is fine… I don&#8217;t have any strong feelings towards or against it but it further adds an element of fantasy to the product.</p>

<blockquote>Packaging is more than just a product container—it’s an extension of a brand’s story. Parker Studio reimagined Milamend’s packaging with thoughtful designs that simplify logistics while maintaining visual appeal. From innovative pouch formats to custom inserts, every detail was crafted to reflect Milamend’s dedication to empowering women through accessible, high-quality solutions.</blockquote><h3>Parker provided text</h3>

<figcaption>Packaging.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The shipping and product packaging both look pretty good and, like the wordmark and monogram, they provide strong visual contrasts between one another. The shipping box is earthy and minimalist, employing the traditional kraft corrugated structure and pairing with always-pleasing white ink. The big racetrack-like shape feels a little out of left field as it&#8217;s not something that happens anywhere else but, in principle, nothing wrong with it. The product packaging is the typical matte pouch and here they also pull off a single-color reproduction quite nicely with some solid hierarchy throughout and even implementing a striking illustration.</p>

<p class="end">The rest of the print and digital applications are all very well executed and put the identity elements to good use, with more Tiempos typography throughout and a lovely color palette (seen at the top of the post). Overall, the identity is elegant but without becoming a luxury purchase and it has a feminine touch but without it being clichéd while the presentation of the product is downright craveable.</p>
