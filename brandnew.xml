                                            <p><strong>Relevant quote</strong><br /><em>The Chinese logotype has been refreshed to ensure seamless alignment with the existing English logotype, mirroring essential elements such as stroke thickness, shadow effects, and overall logotype characteristics.<br /><br />The packaging revamp enhances clarity and coherence by redesigning the information system to effectively address hierarchy issues. This includes incorporating bilingual product names, sizes, unique selling points, safety information, cautions, slogans, and company details. This well-structured format enhances product visibility and effectively communicates essential features. A technology-focused window section featuring new imagery has been introduced to enhance product communication. Textures that replicate the functionality of the products—such as cling film and aluminium foil—have been applied, while the accompanying imagery accurately represents the product size. The dimensions of the photographed objects effectively convey the actual size of the product, ensuring consumers understand what to expect. This revitalisation enhances Glad’s image as a trustworthy and professional brand, showcasing its commitment to innovation and excellence in delivering dependable kitchen solutions for modern living.

                                            <p><strong>Opinion</strong><br />
                                            While I lack any understanding or grasp the intricacies of the Chinese writing system to properly address the logo evolution, I can safely say that, visually, it's a huge improvement as there is much better synergy and relationship between the two languages now that the Chinese version has matching flared “serifs” and more pronounced angles to echo those of the Latin characters, not to mention the easy fix of now matching the strokes and shadows between the two elements. The drop shadow has also been removed from the holding shape and I'm sure they probably tried to get rid of the gradients within, which would have made for an even lovelier improvement but packaging by mega corporations simply can't fully let go of extraneous elements like gradients.<span></span> It's hard to get too enthused about mainstream packaging because, in the end, it all still looks generic and forgettable but the evolution of this system is as good and exciting as it gets within this realm. All the changes are beneficial and yield better hierarchy and a clearer representation of the product. The supporting typography in blue looks surprisingly good as it contrasts so much more boldly with the primary yellow and red of the brand. The detailed illustrations of the product's features are quite good and the icon set is excellent — I LOVE the <a href="https://underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/glad_hong_kong_icon_set_microbe.png" target="_blank">anti-microbe one</a>. The swoosh-y windows that show the product are a little cheesy but, again, it's what's expected of the category and it's as slick as it gets.<span></span> The highlight of the project, though, is the new typography on the storage bags and shows how cool a more minimalist version of this packaging could be as even the Glad logo looks stylish in single-color white ink. Overall, a strong evolution that does the best it can within the constraints of mass consumer goods and makes cling wrap as exciting as it can be.</p>

<h1 class="friday_likes">Melodi Café by Studio Born</h1>
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/friday_likes_melodi.jpg" alt="Melodi Café by Studio Born" />

<p style="margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;"><a href="https://www.instagram.com/melodicafe1957/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Melodi Café</a> is the first retail experience created by Turkish chocolate producer, <a href="https://www.melodi.com.tr/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Melodi Çikolata</a>, which has been in business since 1957. The café, located in Istanbul&#8217;s Etiler neighborhood, offers drinks, treats, and baked goods made with their chocolate as well as a generous selection of their flagship products. The identity, designed by local firm <a href="https://www.studioborn.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Studio Born</a>, takes the existing design sensibilities of the parent brand and café-itizes them, which I know is not an actual term but that&#8217;s exactly what is happening here. Case in point, the café&#8217;s logo follows the same curvature and uppercase setting with a lowercase “i” as the main logo but renders it in a bolder flared serif and adds all the necessary strokes and drop shadows to make it look like a Paris café. The parent brand uses a combination of exuberant typefaces and the café does as well but are even more expressive and have an artisanal patina that makes everything look even more irresistible. The brand&#8217;s <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C8l3u2kK7vk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">signature cat</a> also appears here in a coffee cup as its vessel to deliver some additional cuteness overload. <span class="pagination_divider"></span><span class="small_caps"><a href="https://www.behance.net/gallery/209574511/MELODI-CAFE-Branding-Packaging" target="_blank" rel="noopener">See full project</a></span></p>

<h1 class="friday_likes">Objekt by Hugmun</h1>
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/friday_likes_objekt.jpg" alt="Objekt by Hugmun" />

<p style="margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;"><a href="https://www.instagram.com/objekt_gallery/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Objekt</a> is an art gallery — a <em>Collectible Design Gallery</em> in their own words — in Warsaw, Poland, that, as its name implies, focuses on objects…  unique collector-worthy pieces that blur the boundaries between design and art. The identity, designed by Copenhagen, Denmark-based <a href="https://hugmun.studio/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hugmun</a>, takes a minimalist approach with a lovely wordmark (that uses Schick Tikka&#8217;s <a href="https://www.schick-toikka.com/items" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Items</a> as a starting point) at the forefront. The stunning red color of the printed pieces comes from the gallery&#8217;s <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DAts6gPues6/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">own red floor</a> — a bold choice to present work but one that works surprisingly well. The contrast with the white boxes that serve as invitations is excellent and the white glove with the logo embroidered on it seals the deal for me. <span class="pagination_divider"></span><span class="small_caps"><a href="https://hugmun.studio/#10045402382680" target="_blank" rel="noopener">See full project</a></span>

<h1 class="friday_likes">Elgin by Davy Denduyver</h1>
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/friday_likes_elgin.jpg" alt="Elgin by Davy Denduyver" />

<p style="margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:30px!important;"><a href="https://www.elginsgn.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Elgin</a> is a casual dining restaurant and wine bar in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, offering Asian-inspired sharing plates paired with a curated wine program. The identity, designed by Bruges, Belgium-based <a href="https://www.davydenduyver.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Davy Denduyver</a>, has a fun source of inspiration: restaurant receipts. This takes the form, primarily, in the supporting monospace typography that looks as if it just came out of a thermal printing little machine for receipts where type can often get stretched and distorted because of how glossy and slippery that paper is. On the menus, the type stretches vertically, horizontally, it don&#8217;t care. The repetition and oversize typesetting makes these even more entertaining. The logo, which is meant to “evoke the feel of a signature or a quick note”, does not quite seem to fit the concept as it&#8217;s not really that signature-y and most people don&#8217;t make notes on receipts but, as a standalone piece of lettering, it&#8217;s fun, bouncy, and rugged. I have always loved the dark green and pink combination and it doesn&#8217;t fail to delight here. <span class="pagination_divider"></span><span class="small_caps"><a href="https://www.davydenduyver.com/work/elgin" target="_blank" rel="noopener">See full project</a></span></p>

                                            <p><strong>Relevant quote</strong><br /><em>Whilst EcoSecurities’ proven track record in the market sets them in good stead, they were in danger of resting too much on their heritage and getting left behind in the market. They needed a new brand and positioning to help keep them at the forefront of the cause, focus their offer and firmly cement them as one of the market leaders in funding and developing impactful carbon projects.<br /><br />With their firmly established global reach and network being a key differentiator in the sector, EcoSecurities were keen that this be reflected in their logo. With this in mind, we created a pulsating ‘e’ which wraps around a sphere to represent global impact – both environmental and financial. The simple mark feels established and timeless as it effectively tells the story of the business, links tightly with the new positioning, and anchors the visual identity system.<br /><br />For the visual identity we looked to combine the two very different worlds that EcoSecurities lives in. To represent the more corporate, financial side of the business we developed a modern, elegant key-line language which frames content, and forms grids, icons and infographics. For the more tactile, environmental side of the business we used far softer elements. People were placed front and centre and an expressive yellow glow was developed to represent potential and positivity whilst also standing out from a sea of green competitors.

                                            <p><strong>Opinion</strong><br />
                                            The old logo was bland and executed with minimal exertion but, all things considered, it was not “bad”. The new logo introduces a more engaging visual hook in the form of an “e” wrapping around an implied planet Earth. At first glance it feels corporate and even dated but its dimensional effect is really well executed and its animation is superb — as the actions of EcoSecurities echo around the globe — which sways my opinion to like it more than my gut reaction would allow. I wonder of the endings of the two swooshes should be the same as the ending of the “e”, which is far less pointy and more pleasant. The wordmark is mostly fine but, with such a long name, I feel like it's spaced out way too much, leading to an extra long wordmark. Its airiness does match the openness of the monogram, so it kinda works.<span></span> The identity is quite nice, introducing a visual language led by thin white strokes to use as divider rules and holding shapes, paired with the rich green backgrounds and the soft yellow gradients that fade into transparency to interact with the green or the photography behind them. A matching set of thin-stroked icons and the lighter weights of Space Grotesk round out the assets to deliver the information and messaging in a crisp yet soothing system. Overall, this has a delicate but science-y tone that is quite apt for the fragile state of the planet and the technology and efforts needed to keep it going for a few more years, decades, hopefully centuries.</p>

Drawing inspiration from the iconic US ‘general store’, Bellerose focuses on timeless designs and exceptional craftsmanship; creating versatile, casual yet sophisticated pieces that are built to last. Recently appointing a new Creative Director, Bellerose wanted to modernise their brand without losing their distinct and iconic heritage. To help outfit Bellerose with a fresh look and feel was the Brussels office of <a href="https://www.basedesign.com/">Base Design</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
As Derek Van Heurck stepped in as Creative Director, bringing a more contemporary vision, the brand faced an important challenge: how could it evolve into a new chapter while staying true to and leveraging its heritage? The challenge was to modernize without losing the essence that made Bellerose iconic.

</figure>

<p>The old logo clearly reflected the brand&#8217;s Americana roots, featuring a hand-lettered, inky font reminiscent of vintage American signage. I also think it felt a bit Art Nouveau-inspired, and more European. Confusing or not, it&#8217;s clear this logo felt at odds with the direction of the company. And whilst the brand had a modern look and feel around it, it was the last remaining piece that harkened back to a vintage era, so was due an update.</p>  

<p>The new logo follows the trend of fashion houses sans-ing their serifs with a Neo-grotesque font complete with über-tight kerning and an adjusted, right-angled ‘r’. It&#8217;s both conventional and unconventional at the same time; having the neutrality that a Helvetica-esque font gives you, but with a sort of quiet avant-garde attitude through how it&#8217;s been kerned and adjusted. For me, it feels like fashion is one of the few industries where you can be deliberately edgy and do things unconventionally &#8220;just because&#8221;, so I can push aside all my immediate questions about the &#8220;rules&#8221; of typography and just enjoy this logo for what it is &#8211; something that&#8217;s bold and quietly unconventional. It&#8217;s certainly a welcome departure for the vintage style of old and feels at home with contemporary fashion brands of today.</p>

<p>In addition to the logo we have a suite of monograms, symbols and short-form versions. Not entirely sure how much of a purpose they all serve, but &#8220;fashion&#8221;, right? However, they do alleviate issues with small labels and legibility with shorter versions, such as the &#8216;bb&#8217; or the &#8216;blr&#8217;. I&#8217;m a bit confused why there&#8217;s not a &#8216;br&#8217; version as that seems the most natural fit for a shortened variation? Either way it&#8217;s all very <em>fashion</em> to just vibe it like this and it&#8217;s more about the attitude it conveys than extreme brand clarity (at least that&#8217;s how I see it), so I&#8217;m down with this. We also have to remind ourselves that this is a well established brand so they have the opportunity to be a bit more expressive than a new company would.</p>

<blockquote>
The new identity blends the brand’s classic roots with a bolder, fashion-forward European attitude. This transformation brings a renewed energy and cohesive brand dynamic, marking a shift from 70&#8217;s Americana-inspired aesthetics to a more editorial, architectural design.

<p>As a brand that focuses on simplicity and comfort it’s natural that their identity follows a restrained approach. As a result, there&#8217;s not actually a huge amount of brand assets to review. The photography showcases a range of models in stoney environments, bringing a bit of raw, earthiness to the overall feeling &#8211; something that is echoed further above with the logos shown on craft paper. It&#8217;s still delivering on that quiet unconventionality, and even more so in the product shots featuring a crumpled can acting as a table for earrings and the tank top that looks like it&#8217;s just been thrown down for a shot – It feels rough and casual but deliberately so.</p>

<p>The layouts feel very <em>fashion</em>, featuring big hits of the logo and <a href="https://pangrampangram.com/products/neue-montreal">PangramPangram&#8217;s Neue Montreal</a> on its side and bleeding to the edges of the frame. It&#8217;s simple, but confident, and all feels consistent to their core attitude. As I said above, only certain brands can get away with this bold and seemingly stark style, but it takes real skill to pull it together in a cohesive way. Oddly enough, when I see that denim shot, I immediately think of American Apparel or the Gap of old. No doubt because it&#8217;s denim (for Gap), but also because they too were unafraid to show a bit of personality through understated design.</p>

<p>Applications continue where we left off: clean, simple, and confident. We even have a branded lighter – welcome to Europe! Not much more to be said about these as they all feel consistent with what&#8217;s established above. We do start to see a bit more colour here, with a nice hark back to their Americana-inspired roots through the use of Red, White, and Blue.</p>

<p class="end">All in all this is a great example of a less is more approach and confidently running with a deliberate attitude. I like it, I get where they&#8217;re coming from, and buy into it. There&#8217;s a real craft in the ability to create something stylish, yet neutral at the same time, it&#8217;s like watching the coolest shrug you&#8217;ve every seen (please take that as a compliment!). Perhaps it strays too much into that shruggish-neutrality in places but, as I&#8217;ve mentioned, it is a fashion brand after all and they have more license to do so. In the end, it delivers on its intended purpose—bringing Bellerose into the world of fashion today, while maintaining enough of its distinct personality through a controlled, unconventional approach (without ever letting it become a thorn in their side).</p>
