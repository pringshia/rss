Surveying 1,300 creatives across design, strategy, and production, the results aren&#8217;t exactly revelatory in the sense that I think we all know how important motion is to our work — the survey would have been more interesting had it been done with NON-creatives — but the resulting sentiment is validating: “Motion isn’t decoration; it’s strategy”.

Utopia is structurally, financially, and organizationally independent of any other collectives and institutions. In its substance, it is an idealistic attempt to find an approach to music creation which makes it possible to reach the inner essence of a musical text. Since its debut in October 2022, Utopia has already made its mark on the world’s largest concert halls, performing in venues like the Philharmonie Berlin, the Wiener Konzerthaus, the Elbphilharmonie, the Baden-Baden Festspielhaus, MÜPA Budapest, deSingel Antwerp, the Athens Concert Hall Megaron, the Isarphilharmonie in Munich, and Santa Cecilia Hall in Rome. The orchestra’s repertoire spans centuries, encompassing both classical masterpieces and contemporary compositions.&#8221;</p>

Drawing inspiration from cryptography and the symbolism of medieval alchemy, it offers two distinct stylistic sets.<br /><br />The Light version is designed for legible headings in concert listings, brochures, and posters, while the Hard version provides a more expressive letter set for shorter copyrights on merchandise and typographic web animations. The typeface is based on the Inter typeface under an OFL.<br /><br />The website was designed as an immersive gateway into Utopia’s layered world. With an unconventional user journey and a progress bar guiding exploration, it reinforces the idea of a secret society — something you uncover gradually. Animations and transitions echo the sense of time and rhythm found in music, while varied blocks showcase the richness of the Utopia universe.

                                            <p><strong>Opinion</strong><br />
                                            With a name like Utopia and using terms like “shared musical ideology” or “the inner essence of a musical text”, it's not a complete surprise that both old and new logos, along with the new custom typeface, exude a sense of mysticism and the occult with a very subtle hint of utopian optimism. The old logo had a ghostly appearance with its super thin weight and the “t” looked far too much like a Christian cross, making it seem like the orchestra had some religious undertones. (It doesn't, which is why the association to the Cross isn't relevant.) The new logo keeps all of the awkward character shapes — which I'm not sure what concept they serve — but improves them with a bolder weight and by making the “T” and the “I” more robust and interesting with the double line approach. I wouldn't say I like it — because I don't — but it certainly fits the enigmatic mood the orchestra is going for.<span></span> The main attraction of the project is the custom typeface that, depending on your proclivity for odd-shaped and/or unicase letters, will be not enough of a good thing or too much of a bad thing. I'll lay my cards on the table: I don't like it BUT I also think it's perfectly well suited for the task at hand for this particular orchestra in how it attempts to circumvent traditional orchestra models in favor of something more experimental. It's kind of commendable that this is based on <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Inter" target="_blank">Inter</a> and that they were able to squeeze something so funky out of it.<span></span> Paired with moody black and white photography in mostly centered type arrangements — although the circular type arrangements are a nice break — the applications are all properly done and effective. The website, taking an unconventional approach is interesting too… I personally like my websites to be of the point-and-scroll variety instead of zooming and panning around to find stuff but this one is kind of nice in its minimalist black and white approach and generous spacing of all the elements. Overall, this isn't exactly music to my own personal ears but the logo and identity are certainly in harmony with the idealistic sentiment of the orchestra.</p>

<a href="https://www.instagram.com/eat.percent/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Percent</a> is a Peruvian newcomer to the nut spread space with the goal of making “transparency the new standard.” Accompanying the launch of their inaugural product, a 60% hazelnut spread (compared to  <a href="https://www.nutella.com/al/en/products/nutella" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nutella’s 13%!</a>), Percent has unveiled their new name, logo, and identity designed by Lima, Peru-based <a href="https://mino.pe/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MINO</a> and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/angelalberc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ángela Alberca</a>.

<blockquote>
The name Percent is more than just a reference to the percentage of hazelnuts—it is an open and dynamic concept, allowing the brand to expand into new product lines while staying true to its essence. 60% hazelnuts, 54% pistachio, 100% happiness. Percent does not limit itself—it evolves.
<br></br>
The design, with its bold typography and vibrant colors, does not attempt to appear “healthy” in a commercialized sense. Percent does not sell false promises; it offers real pleasure, free from deception. A brand made for a generation that demands transparency and refuses to conform.

<p>
The wordmark, set in an italicized reverse contrast flared serif that offers up a healthy dose of retro appeal, does a fantastic job of conveying the gooey decadence of the product while still feeling hyper-approachable thanks to its soft curves and not-quite-lowercase setting (I see you, cheeky little title case “R”). While I have no idea whether the mark was created by tweaking an existing typeface or drawn completely from scratch, it ultimately doesn’t matter — with its soft corners and delightfully imperfect beziers, it feels totally handmade and bespoke in a way that screams “small-batch craft product” while still exhibiting an attention to detail that inspires trust and signals a certain level of refinement.

<figcaption>Some additional typographic and identity element samples from Percent&#8217;s Instagram because I felt like we needed to see some more examples of how the system works beyond the studio-provided content. The reds don&#8217;t match the rest of this post but we&#8217;re going to let it slide, OK!?</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
While I didn’t get a ton of information about the brand elements or examples of the system in action beyond the packaging, the tiny handful of type-meets-color-meets-photography-meets-graphics samples we do get to see here are well-executed. A friendly sans serif nicely complements the wordmark, offering up communication that feels simple and straightforward while still tying back to the soft approachability of the logo, and the occasional appearance of a very fun retro-inspired script — which the stans among us will immediately recognize as <a href="https://hoodzpahdesign.com/product/redondo-ave-script-font/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hoodzpah’s Redondo Ave</a> — serves to inject personality back into the brand in the event you have forgotten what the logo looks like. I will admit that it took a very long time for my dense brain to recognize the shorthand % mark as such, but once it clicked I found myself ooh-ing at the cleverness and efficiency of the monogram-meets-symbol approach. That said, I’m still reading it as “op.”
</p>


<blockquote>
Percent’s packaging defies conventional aesthetics. There are no generic photos or empty claims. Instead, a simple yet powerful element: a die-cut drop on the label that allows consumers to see, feel, and anticipate the product inside. More than just a design, it is a sensory experience that engages the consumer before even opening the jar.
<br></br>
This drop is not only evocative but also functional. It acts as a symbol of indulgence and pleasure, while also serving as a window into the brand’s transparency. Inside it lies the core message: made with 60% hazelnuts. Simple. Honest. Powerful.

<p>
The packaging (brought to life by <a href="a href="https://www.instagram.com/aizeagrafica_/" target="_blank">AIZEA GRAFICA</a>) is where we get to see it all come together properly. Bright red is an excellent choice to pop off the shelf in a sea of white and beige competitors, but it’s also a risky one that could easily feel abrasive—if it weren’t for the thoughtfully warm, tone-on-tone approach that softens the label and gives it a more approachable, vintage feel. The other brilliant detail of the packaging is the die-cut drip cut-out, which does triple duty in serving as a tie-in to the product (that runs throughout the identity), providing a delightful “reveal&#8221; moment of product’s claim to fame (high hazelnut percentage), and most importantly, elevating the product from commonplace to artisanal— the die cut label signals that while this product comes in the same adorable little jar as your grandma’s homemade jam, you can expect an elevated experience when you take off the top.
</p>

<blockquote>
Percent is more than a hazelnut spread; it is a new way of thinking about what we consume. A reminder that quality does not need to be disguised as “healthy,” and that true luxury lies in authenticity.

The photography (by <a href="a href="https://www.instagram.com/amargaestudio/" target="_blank">Amarga Estudio</a>), while nothing groundbreaking, does a great job tying a bow on the identity with bright, warm lighting and relatable characters that help showcase the product in its most realistic setting — being consumed directly out of the jar.

While I would have loved to see 3x the applications (and perhaps some examples of how the brand might expand beyond the boundaries of the hazelnut), this entire identity left me drooling in more ways than one (and I don’t even really like hazelnuts?). At once familiar and fresh, delightful and relatable, the whole system is a shining example of how thoughtful branding (no matter how small the studio) can take a product to the next level (no matter how small the business).

                                            <p>Writing for Design Week, Alec Mezzetti, Design Director at Mother Design, ponders if the era of overly cutesy, super approachable, soft-edged design and messaging is slowly coming to a close? In other words, is “<a href="https://www.creativebreakdown.blog/p/im-baby-sell-me-insurance" target="_blank" rel="noopener">I’m baby, sell me [blank]</a>” about to become “I’m grown up, explain to me in detail why I should put my trust, money, resources, and loyalty with you”? We might not be there yet but I can easily see this new era looming in 2026, especially as the economy shifts this year and every decision a consumer makes is likely to be more deliberate than before and no amount of cutesy rounded sans serifs might be the convincing argument they (I, we, you) need.

The concept of restoring the glassworks began to take shape at the ancient Zikmundov farm in Stare Hute in the mind of its owner, Adam Havlicek, around 2019. The initial inspiration was the accidental discovery of materials about the history of the Reich family and the former renown of the local glassworks. This story sparked the somewhat ambitious idea of reviving glassmaking where it had vanished 150 years ago and where only the name of the village &#8211; Stare Hute (i.e. the old glassworks)- served as a reminder of its past glory. The idea evolved into a plan, and over the next two years, Adam Havlicek visited numerous glassworks across Europe to determine the best technology for producing future Izaak Reich glasses. Our brand received a clear direction after a fateful meeting with Rony Plesl, a renowned Czech glass artist and designer. Adam enthusiastically agreed to Rony&#8217;s proposal to create the first Linden collection as a tribute to the old glassmakers and the Reich family.&#8221;</p>

The Untitled Sans sans-serif font and hot stamping in the colour of molten glass underline the high quality of this small glassworks. The visual style is consistently reflected in the functional and eco-friendly packaging designed by Jan Činčera, the company's printed materials, leaflets and certificates, right through to the bespoke e-commerce website.

                                            <p><strong>Opinion</strong><br />
                                            The relationship between the wordmark and the monogram with the product is instantly and efficiently clear: The thin, delicate, beautifully-crafted aesthetic of the glassware is effortlessly translated into the high-contrast sans serif approach that emulates the thinness of the bowls of the glasses with the thicker stems. Simple, elegant, and effective, especially in the wordmark. The monogram… I understand what they were going for in trying to reproduce the silhouette of a tall glass of wine (as well as trying to pull off an “IR” combination) but the long stem of the “I”-slash–“R” feels kind of silly, leaving the bowl and leg of the “R” awkwardly and stiffly floating in the air. Maybe I'm alone in my lack of appreciation for it.<span></span> The identity is perfectly cued towards an affluent consumer base, exuding a sense of luxury and attention to detail, focusing on copper as the primary brand color and some elegant, centered layouts. The supporting muted mint color used on the website is a great complement to the copper too. The packaging does a good job in not letting this be totally ostentatious by using the ever-humble kraft box with copper foil stamping as the sole hint of luxury although that die-cut that nestles the glasses and the no-glue locking mechanism is probably a more expensive flex than foil. Overall, a lovely and elegant identity that matches the 60-Euro price point per glass that is above and beyond my red SOLO cup budget.</p>

                                            <p>Launched in 2025, <a href="https://moremud.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mud™</a> is a new dog care brand in the UK offering an everyday wash free of gimmicky smells that celebrates dogs being dogs in all their filthy, smelly glory. Created by London, UK-based graphic designer <a href="https://angelinapischikova.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Angelina Pischikova</a> and London-based art director and brand strategist <a href="https://cocarinne.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Karina Zhukovskaya</a>, mud™ is a response to a culture that has, partly, turned dogs into accessories and that, as the founders say, are presented “spotless, well-behaved, highly aesthetic dogs” on social media as opposed to accepting them as the animals they are that like to “roll in dead things, eat trash, and lick your face right after” — I would also add, from personal experience, eating their own vomit. It also acknowledges the fact that dogs&#8217; sense of smell is insanely more sensitive than humans&#8217; so their 300 million scent receptors are seriously overwhelmed by washes that smell like tutti frutti. In development since 2023, the resulting wash is pH-balanced, odor-neutralizing, and made with natural, plant-based ingredients including oat, aloe, and panthenol that smells like absolutely nothing. Given the background of the two founders, the whole brand was created in-house.</p>

<blockquote>mud™ is a small act of rebellion against the sanitised world of modern pet care. The brand embraces the mess and its visual identity reflects that. The logo reacts to the weather—expanding with rain, contracting in the dry—just like the mud under their paws. The mud™ thermal-ink bottle mimics the cycle. When wet, the logo vanishes like dirt washing off a dog, then reappears as it dries. A metaphor for the mess, the rinse, and the return to it.</blockquote><h3>mud™ provided text</h3>

<p>As the owner of not one, not two, not three but four dogs, none of which are primed to be social media influencers, this project speaks to me and makes me feel seen for the amount of assault on my senses, emotions, and personal space that these dogs unleash on me every single day. I love them. Starting with the name, you know this brand is going to be different. Rather than being named after a possible solution to the problem, it&#8217;s named after the problem: Mud. By doing so it flips the script and encourages dog owners to literally embrace the mud and the subtle hints of dirt, dead worms, and old leaves that give your dogs that particular smell they have but also metaphorically as a way to embrace the fact that dogs are dogs.</p>

<p>The logo, unlike any other care brand out there — be it for dogs or humans — is also the opposite of what you would expect. Instead of crisp and elegant to denote a fresh start, the mud™ logo is blobby, gooey, dirty, and, despite being three short letters, teeters on unreadability in some of its variations. I love how the concept revolves around the nature of mud that, as it gets wet it expands and oozes and just makes a bigger mess with the more water there is. It&#8217;s such a simple logo and idea but the execution is so rich and textural that you get the best of both worlds: clean and dirty.</p>

<p>The one odd thing so far is the more oily 3D renderings… which feel very synthetic and kind of go against the more natural theme and aesthetic of the logo. In general the 3D approach seems unnecessary and I would rather see more play with grungy, dirty textures.</p>

<figcaption>Mini packaging. The bottle is printed with thermal ink that reacts to temperature change.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The packaging for the regular size and mini bottles is great… going with a minimalist, deadpan approach that is accentuated by the grunginess of the logo. The color of the bottle, a dark tan, would be off-putting under normal circumstances as a wash product but, along with everything else, it works beautifully within this imperfect, unpolished realm. For the mini bottles, the logo is printed using thermal ink so when heat — warm water in this case — is applied to it, the logo disappears just like mud being slowly washed away. On the packaging we also get a glimpse of what has to be the best part of this project: the tone of voice. On the front it reads “For dirty dogs” and on the back it proudly states “Tested on Animals. They love it.” Both lines are so good in different ways but, most importantly, they establish mud™ as a brand that challenges conventions and expectations.</p>

<p class="end">The rest of the applications shown above and the product&#8217;s website are a masterclass in copywriting and a fantastic example of dialing into a very specific tone of voice that, rather than being repetitive and formulaic, allows the brand to speak consistently. It knows its enemy, it knows its benefits, it knows its point of differentiation (or unique selling proposition if you will), it knows how to speak to dog owners, and it knows how to command attention. Like… “Dogs want chaos, not chamomile”? and “Filth is freedom”? Just stop, it&#8217;s too much, too good. Even the devil-possessed photos of the dogs at night are fitting. Overall, if it wasn&#8217;t evidently clear by now, I love this… it&#8217;s raw, it&#8217;s honest, it&#8217;s properly targeted to a specific type of dog owner, and it&#8217;s all executed with evident joy, passion, and, most importantly, a love for dogs and all their nasty habits.</p>
