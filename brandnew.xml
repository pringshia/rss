                                                                    <img src="https://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/wp/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/2025_02_05_Warehouse_Clearance_BN.jpg" alt="Brand New Shop: 30% Off!" />
                                
                                
                                
                                                                                
                                        
                                            
                                            <p>After a year of trying out a third-party logistics service to fulfill the <a href="https://brandnewshop.underconsideration.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Brand New Shop</a> orders we&#8217;ve realized that, as a small business that is NOT focused on retail, the cost does not make sense for the amount of inventory we generate and move. It was super nice to not have to pack things and create labels ourselves and the service we chose, Shipmonk, was actually pretty great but the expense simply did not add up for us.</p>

<p>So, in order to make a dent into our inventory at their warehouse before having to do an extraction mission that will be costly on freight shipping costs, <strong>we are offering all of our products at 30% off</strong> plus free shipping within the U.S. and $15 flat rate for the rest of the world.</p>

<p>We will be closing our warehouse account at the end of February and the discount will end then or until supplies last.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;ve been considering a Brand New hoodie, tote bag, cap, or t-shirt, <a href="https://brandnewshop.underconsideration.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">now&#8217;s the time to strike</a>.</p>

<p class="end">To everyone that paid full price at any point last year, thank you for your support and early adoption!</p>

                                            <p>In 2023, D.C. Superior Court Judge Neal E. Kravitz ordered that the Proud Boys — an American far-right, neo-fascist militant organization — had to pay $2.8 million to the <a href="https://www.metropolitaname.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Metropolitan African Methodist Episcopal Church</a> in Washington D.C. after the group had vandalized it in 2020. Failing to pay, a new ruling against the Proud Boys this month by D.C. Superior Court Judge Jones Bosier has ordered the transfer of the group&#8217;s trademarks — name and symbols — to the church. This means, among other things, that the church can seize money the group makes by selling merchandise or otherwise using the term &#8220;Proud Boys&#8221; and that the Proud Boys can only use their name or symbols with permission from the church. I guess the church could also demand that the group change its name altogether. In the end, this might just be a slap on the wrist for the hateful group but it must sting bad at the moment — enough that <a href="https://x.com/NobleOne/status/1886782313742135707" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the group&#8217;s leader took to X</a> demanding the church be stripped from its nonprofit status, that the judge be impeached, and that, jokingly (badly) the Proud Boys would now be known as the “African Methodist Episcopal Boys”. Not the zinger he probably intended it to be.</p>

Its 40,000 islands and islets offer authentic nature, serene silence, and unforgettable adventures. The area stretches along the coast of Southwestern Finland, all the way to Åland. On the mainland, the cities of Turku, Naantali, and Parainen serve as the primary gateways to the inner and outer archipelago. Saaristo is stunning year-round, and every season has something special to offer. Summer is lively, with more services available and events to attend, while spring and autumn bring their own charm to the island landscapes. Winter offers a unique traveling experience, complete with snowy Arctic landscapes and the frozen sea.&#8221;</p>

This idea is captured in the brand promise, “Shaped by Saaristo”—a call to travelers seeking life-defining, meaningful moments in untouched nature.<br /><br />The name Saaristo—the Finnish word for “archipelago”—anchors the brand in authenticity, reinforcing its local roots. While unfamiliar to outsiders, the name strategically highlights the region’s uniqueness, inviting curiosity and exploration.<br /><br />Sculpted directly from the outlines of eight real islands within the archipelago, the logo is an homage to the region itself. A humorous twist during the process saw one island "go missing," prompting a two-day search across maps until the team rediscovered it—a testament to the archipelago's vast scale.

                                            <p><strong>Opinion</strong><br />
                                            For anyone that has been clamoring for branding to not be so safe and/or for branding to get weird, this project is for you. At least the logo is, as things get a little tamer in the identity. By scouring through the more than 40,000 islands that make up the archipelago, Bond found eight of them that looked just enough like the letters in the destination's name to bring them together and spell it out. On their own, each letter would be unreadable but when they come together, it's surprisingly readable (relatively speaking) and delightfully weird in a way that only the Scandinavians know how to pull off where it comes across as both slightly deranged but also completely rational. This is a long and perhaps confusing way of saying that I love this logo.<span></span> I wish that kind of weird energy transferred into the identity, which is totally fine, but I feel like they went all in on the logo and then got shy about what to do with it or put around it. It helps that the photography of the place is beautiful and at times eerily otherworldly so that helps in capturing some of that energy. There is also a nice choice in the serif, <a href="https://ecal-typefaces.ch/typeface/kolonia/" target="_blank">Kolonia</a> but its use in curved paths is somehow off-putting. Nonetheless, their website, as the main point of contact for most visitors, is inviting and alluring, putting the island shapes to good use as transitions while scrolling. Overall, this is top-notch archipelago branding content and, on a more serious note, it is a destination brand that perfectly captures the essence of said destination.</p>

                                            <p>Established in 1926, <a href="https://www.kentandcurwen.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kent&amp;Curwen</a> is a British heritage brand offering, for lack of a better term and with no offense meant, the ultimate, high-end expression of preppy fashion. (There is actually a better term for it as used by the brand: “a classic ideal of British collegiate style”.) Founded by Eric Kent and Dorothy Curwen, it began as a maker of club and college ties for Oxford and Cambridge universities growing to offer sports kits for rowers, rugby players, and cricketers becoming embraced by an audience they define as “students and royals, boxing clubs and banks alike”. After a decade of highs and lows — including a successful 5-year partnership with David Beckham — that resulted in a couple of ownership changes, the brand is coming back strong this year under the design direction of Daniel Kearns as it embraces a “genderless wardrobe, intended to be shared and borrowed” and has introduced a new identity designed by Paris, France-based <a href="https://www.yorgo.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Yorgo&amp;Co</a>.</p>

<blockquote>Kent&amp;Curwen appointed Daniel Kearns as chief creative officier to bring a new dynamic to its storied heritage. We accompanied him and his team to set up a full brand system,with new custom letterings for both the serif word mark and the secondary sans-serif informations.<br /><br />The iconic three lions have been redrawn in three levels of detail to suit various applications. The brand&#8217;s flexibility is showcased through various brand blocks: some feature the new rose we designed, others include just &#8220;K&#038;C&#8221; or the founding date. Together, they evoke the versatility and cultural richness of English tradition.</blockquote><h3><a href="https://www.yorgo.co/work_category_branding_branding-350" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Yorgo&amp;Co project page</a></h3>

<p>This is an evolution that might pass unperceived by most consumers… even I, as I woke up groggily this morning to write this Review, had to do a double take on the header image to make sure I hadn&#8217;t repeated the before logo in the after area, which is not to say, in any way, that the evolution was unnecessary or unsuccessful. Quite the contrary, this is a superb evolution that, as you can see, maintains the essence of its predecessor but improves it in every single aspect for a more balanced and streamlined execution better suited to the various production methods employed by the brand across its apparel, accessories, and high-end knick-knacks.</p>

<p>The biggest improvement in the logo is the new “Three Lions emblem” — inspired by the Kent family crest — that has been beautifully redrawn by <a href="http://chriswormell.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chris Wormell</a> not just one time, not just two times, but three times, each with a different level of detail for reproduction at different sizes. All three are excellent and equally effective for their intended purposes: at large sizes, the facial features of the lion, its mane, its claws, and its fur yield a richly detailed and high-end brand asset where the traditional heraldic <em>Passant Guardant</em> position can be appreciated as it is lovingly accented with an untraditional rose on the lion&#8217;s tail. The medium-sized variation looks like it can withstand anything, maintaining just enough detail to convey light and shadow but simple enough to reduce well. Finally, the smallest size, as you will see in a few of the applications in this post, can be embroidered or emblazoned in the smallest of areas and retain the essence of its bigger brethren.</p>

<p>The wordmark is also a great evolution, doubling down on the serif approach — thank goodness this didn&#8217;t evolve into a deadpan sans serif — with sharper and more pronounced serifs that create a slick bottom and top as the serifs fall flat on the baseline and cap-height. The size and spacing of the ampersand could be argued both ways… on the one hand, it was nice to have some breathing space as it sat between the two words and offered a point of contrast by being smaller. On the other hand, the bigger ampersand keeps a consistent rhythm across the long name and makes it feel more like it&#8217;s a united front. The contrasting “ENGLAND” and “1926” in a bold, condensed sans serif look great.</p>

</figure>

<p>From the main logo, a series of secondary elements can be extracted and, certainly, the hero is the new rose icon taken from the lion&#8217;s tail. It&#8217;s a lovely drawing on its own and I&#8217;m sure it will become a recognizable and identifying asset for Kent&amp;Curwen. The shorthand typographic badges are all also excellent supporting elements, adding variety to the system while being effective call-backs to the primary logo.</p>

<p>As you can appreciate, I was not lying to you about how well the new logo and all the various assets adapt to the endless product applications and production techniques for each, whether it&#8217;s embroidery, metal casting,  or whatever bedazzled action is going on directly above. While there is a clear level of luxury in the actual materials and textiles used, the high-performance aspect of the brand assets elevates it all even more.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not exactly sure what all this red stuff is about but the one thing that is clear is that the identity can adapt to just about anything, from the color palette shifting from black and white to red and black (and gold) and for the brand assets to go from being embroidered to being raised in wax, it can do no wrong. (Gold foil at small sizes might be pushing it but, still, that image directly above is as fire as any of the others.)</p>

<p class="end">Heck, the lions can even be reproduced as single-line neon lights. Get out. That&#8217;s just flat out impressive. Overall, this is a fantastic update thanks to the robust and elegant range of assets created by Yorgo&amp;Co that bring out the best in Kent&amp;Curwen&#8217;s high-end preppy sty… excuse me, in Kent&amp;Curwen&#8217;s classic ideal of British collegiate style.</p>

Our team is based in Los Angeles and New York City, and the practice is organized as five interdependent workshops: Buildings, Landscape, Museums, Objects, and Ideas. This unique cross-disciplinary structure enables us to work across multiple sectors and combine different forms of expertise, generating progressive solutions for projects ranging from museums to mixed-use developments, community arts centers to private residences. In recent years, WHY has gained a reputation as a thought-leader in the fields of cultural and civic architecture, winning global competitions including the Ross Pavilion and West Princes Street Gardens in Edinburgh, Scotland, and taking on major cultural landmark projects such as the Tchaikovsky Academic Opera and Ballet Theater in Perm, Russia.&#8221;</p>

                                            <p><strong>Relevant quote</strong><br /><em>The identity sits somewhere between the WHY and the WHY NOT. There’s structure, balance, a minimalism that lets their work and ideas speak for themselves. And there’s the opportunity to be more playful, more thoughtful, more curious – depicting their individual approach and refreshing thinking.<br /><br />Need retained the original stencil concept, creating two new typefaces for the visual identity – one called WHY and one called WHY NOT. This is something that excited their designers beyond belief.<br /><br />Overall, Need gave the brand order and useful systems, while injecting some of WHY’s natural charm and charisma.

                                            <p><strong>Opinion</strong><br />
                                            With a sturdy stencil logo already in place — and a very nice one at that — the new identity smartly takes that as a starting point to create a kind of methodical new system that manages to be visually rich without going overboard. Behind the execution is a great premise that takes advantage of the firm's name: If you ask why, you should also ask why not. This is expressed in the contrast of the filled-in logo and the outline version, both of which are great in their own right but as a yin and yang pair, they are more meaningful and interesting. This is extended into a custom type family in two styles, filled in and outlined. Why and Why Not. It's a no-frills type family in terms of letterform shapes — like, it doesn't get wacky or overly inventive — but when the two styles are used in combination it yields a robust visual language.<span></span> Importantly, the identity doesn't outshine the architectural work, whether it's on the firm's website or their project and client presentations, which look great. The one element that maybe goes too far is the outline-plus-3D version of the logo that becomes highly unreadable and even if we took it as just a visual device not meant to be read, it's kind of messy and distracting. On the other end of the coolness spectrum, the eye candy highlight of the project is the translucent orange stencil. How it's used or who it's given to, I don't know but it's undeniably cool. Overall, this isn't a revolutionary or in-your-face identity but it is very nicely executed and has just enough of an edge to it to stand out from other architecture firms and helps convey both the creativity and rigor of this architecture firm.</p>
