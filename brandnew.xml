Housed in the original Carlsberg brewery in Valby in Copenhagen, Denmark, and with access to one of the world’s largest yeast collections at Carlsberg’s research center, the brewery operates like a craft brewery (but has the capacity of a larger one) by regularly coming up with new beers, experimenting with flavors and combinations, along with a range of seasonal and fixed offerings.</p>

                                            <p><strong>Relevant quote</strong><br /><em>Jacobsen partnered with UK based branding studio Robot Food to simplify and amplify its identity and brand assets. The focus was on making the brand easier to spot, easier to shop, and more accessible to a wider range of drinkers, while retaining its premium positioning.<br /><br />By honouring the past with a firm eye on progression, Jacobsen perfectly balances its commitment to quality and innovation. This sentiment served as a guiding principle throughout the brand refresh. Robot Food focused on developing established brand assets with a contemporary mindset, resulting in an updated identity that looks directly to the future.<br /><br />One detail that holds special significance is the inclusion of "Bryggeri" (brewery) in the identity, bringing it closer to the brand’s home at Husbryggeriet Jacobsen. This subtle yet meaningful addition reinforces the deep-rooted connection between Jacobsen and its place of origin.<br /><br />Alongside the updated identity, Robot Food also renovated the application of the brand signature patterns and colour palette. The previous ‘organoleptic’ patterns were born from the sensorial tasting notes of each brew’s individual flavour and reflective of the drinking experience you could expect from each beer type.<br /><br />To align with evolving consumer preferences, Robot Food developed a design system that seamlessly integrates cans and bottles into one cohesive expression, with a consistent and flexible visual language across formats. The clarified pack structure improves the reading sequence and helps consumers to navigate between ranges including seasonal, limited edition and collaborative brews.

                                            <p><strong>Opinion</strong><br />
                                            The old logo, drawn by <a href="http://marcosnavarro.es/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Marcos Navarro</a> under the guidance of Montdor at the time, was a pretty convincing rendition of Jacob Christian Jacobsen and the typography around him was quite good. Now, after taking some supplements, doing some resistance training complemented by cardio, moisturizing, and hydrating his beard with oil on a regular basis, Mr. Jacobsen is looking more energetic, lively, and, most importantly, happier than before. The new badge is more optimistic with the profile looking forward; cleaner without the textured lines in the background; bolder with a filled-in ring; and still as sharp with its strong typography that now has also been simplified with just “Bryggeri”. It can also now take on more interesting color combinations instead of being used in a single color like in the packaging before.<span></span> I wasn't a huge fan of the patterns then and I'm still not a fan now as I feel like there is a very big disconnect between the aesthetics of the logo and those of the patterns, which are all over the place in terms of colors, shapes, and compositions. I guess they are better now, used at bigger sizes and in more contained areas (as opposed to going above and below each beer's name) but they still come across as oddly unrelated to anything else going on with the brand. The cans and bottle labels are indeed an improvement in most aspects, being less visually fuzzy with simpler layouts, all-uppercase typography (still using <a href="https://www.oldtooltypes.com/work#/jacobsen/" target="_blank">their proprietary type</a>), and slightly more color contrast.<span></span> The limited edition beers have a decent system to keep things unified but they further add to the randomness of the artwork, which I guess, by committing to it, becomes the recognizable element of the brand. Overall, a strong logo evolution but sticking to the pattern formula seems to have limited its potential to do something more visually evocative and distinctive as well as also something more specific to Jacobsen than just a generic craft beer patina.</p>

                                                                    <img src="https://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/wp/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/maeve_logo_before_after.png" alt="New Logo, Identity, and Packaging for Maeve by The Young Jerks" />
                                
                                
                                
                                                                                
                                        
                                            
                                            
<p>Established in 1991, Seattle Chocolate Company is the parent company behind two separate chocolate brands: Seattle Chocolate (now <a href="https://maevechocolate.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Maeve</a>) and <a href="https://jcocochocolate.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">jcoco</a> proudly produced in the Pacific Northwest from their factory (and tasting room) in Tukwila, WA. Part of the story relates to said factory, which was destroyed by the 2001 Nisqually Earthquake, leading Jean Thompson, who had previously been an investor in the company, to take the reins as CEO and has successfully transformed the company into a profitable, socially-conscious, carbon-neutral, women-owned business. Now, on to the titular, Maeve: Replacing the consumer brand, Seattle Chocolate, Maeve (named after a “fiery first-century Irish warrior queen”) sources its cocoa directly and ethically from farmers in Ghana, Peru, Tanzania, and the Dominican Republic ensuring fair pay and long-term sustainability — 10% of Maeve&#8217;s net profits fund projects to improve the lives of cocoa farmers — to offer an impressively wide (and fun) selection of truffle-based bars and bonbons. Already available in grocers nationwide and looking to make a broader impact and grow its audience by leaving behind the “Seattle” localization, Maeve has introduced a new packaging system designed by Brooklyn, NY-based <a href="https://youngjerks.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Young Jerks</a>.</p>

<span id="more-304046"></span>

<blockquote>The transformation began as a conversation between Seattle Chocolate Owner and CEO Jean Thompson and her daughter and Seattle Chocolate Brand Manager Ellie Thompson &#8211; a shared vision to expand beyond Seattle while staying true to the company&#8217;s roots. What started as an idea quickly became a reality, as the duo realized the potential of their small-but-mighty chocolate brand to resonate with a new generation of chocolate lovers nationwide.<br /><br />Inspired by the legendary Irish warrior queen, Maeve represents strength, boldness, and a fearless approach to chocolate. The rebrand gives consumers a chocolate experience that is ethical, delicious, and fun.</blockquote><h3><a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/seattle-chocolate-evolves-into-maeve-a-bold-new-era-for-ethical-joyful-chocolate-302390151.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Seattle Chocolate Company press release</a></h3>

<blockquote>To bring Maeve to life, the brand partnered with independent brand and packaging studio, Young Jerks creating a whimsical world of imagination and flavor. Inspired by quirky characters like Greg Glitter, Cheryl the Forest Nymph, and Pinkbeard the Pirate, Maeve&#8217;s creations invite consumers to experience conscientious, craft chocolate light-heartedly and transport them to otherworldly realms where every treat is a delightful journey.</blockquote><h3><a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/seattle-chocolate-evolves-into-maeve-a-bold-new-era-for-ethical-joyful-chocolate-302390151.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Seattle Chocolate Company press release</a></h3>

<p>The old name and logo were perfectly fine but, whether in contrast to the new name and logo or even without that stark comparison, they were both relatively forgettable and somewhat generic. Personally, I had never heard of this brand before — and I <em>love</em> chocolate — so I was surprised to see it so widely available because my first thought when getting the press release about it was that this was a small chocolate brand sold locally (or regionally at most) and as far as chocolate provenances go, Seattle isn&#8217;t top of mind for me so the change to something less localized and specific into a short and catchy name is an excellent move. Sure, there will be some existing, loyal customers that may be disgruntled about the change but I think the upside of the new name and packaging to capture new audiences outweighs any cons in this case.</p>

<p>The new logo is so good, rendering the five-letter name using, basically, only two shapes. The same glyph is used for the “M” and the “E”s and the same glyph is used for the “A” and the “V”. (While in different markets and with different design approaches, Maeve is a great example of pulling off the “M”/“E” trick more successfully and interestingly <a href="https://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/new_logo_and_identity_for_drents_museum_by_g2k.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">than the recent Drents Museum</a>, which I point out not to throw shade at Drents but to highlight that a similar idea can live or die by its execution.) I love the chunkiness of the logo, I love the construction of the two glyphs, and I love how tightly set it is. The one thing I&#8217;m unsure about is the colorful trailing drop-shadow-esque repetition… I like how it looks on the packaging but when isolated, it&#8217;s a little distracting from the epic structure behind it. The bonus that both the name and the letterforms can adapt to the segments in the bars themselves is icing on the cake.</p>

<p>The old packaging, as mentioned, was fine and it actually had a solid layout system going on that allowed the use of completely diverse illustration styles to be unified through the cream-colored block and the logo always in the same spot. Taking a cue from this legacy, the new packaging system is incredibly ambitious by establishing a single illustration style that adapts to each of the dozens of flavors the company offers. These aren&#8217;t run-of-the-mill, quick illustrations either. They are extremely detailed, completely unique, and methodically constructed all while being infused with a sense of humor and infinite charm.</p>

<p>There is certainly a method to the madness with an underlying structure and layout system that allows different illustration elements to be plugged in but it&#8217;s still so impressive how many individual elements go into each bar. On top of the illustrations on the packaging, there are matching illustrations to serve as backdrops to place the packaging on top, which add even more related elements. Simply impressive. Aside from the illustrations is the typography, <a href="https://ohnotype.co/fonts/softie" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ohno Softie</a>, a quirky rounded sans serif, which is excellent and a perfect match and complement to the logo and illustrations. They are also clearly having fun with their lifestyle photography and further expanding on the lore of each flavor whether it&#8217;s photographing the “Happy Birthday” bar with a birthday cake or placing the “Cabin S’mores” bar inside a s’more.</p>

<p class="end">The fun continues on the bonbon packaging, where they take a slight break from illustration by using a single typeface for the flavors and I swear to your particular deity of choice that only The Young Jerks can pull off using something as silly and almost useless as the free <a href="https://www.dafont.com/magical-mystery-tour.font" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Magical Mystery Tour</a> font and actually make it look like the absolute right choice. It even works on Maeve&#8217;s website. Overall, this is an amazing, fun, and energetic packaging system and overall brand voice that stands out not just in comparison to the old one but on its own, as an illustration-powered and truffle-filled force to be reckoned with on shelves.</p>

                                            <p><strong>Relevant quote</strong><br /><em>Our mission was to craft a refreshed brand identity that captured La Mansión’s essence while making it relevant for a new generation of guests. The challenge lay in striking a balance between refinement and a contemporary spirit, sophistication and warmth. We designed a visual system that reflects the restaurant’s heritage through a modern lens, using a typographic approach that conveys both elegance and strength. The color palette builds upon the brand’s signature hues, enhancing them with richer, more nuanced tones that highlight the restaurant’s inviting atmosphere. The graphic elements, from the logo to the layout compositions, were conceived with a sense of timelessness—grounded in tradition but flexible enough to evolve.<br /><br />This rebranding extends seamlessly across all touchpoints, from in-restaurant signage to digital platforms, ensuring a cohesive experience that resonates with both long-time guests and first-time guests. Through this redesign, La Mansión reaffirms its place as a cornerstone of Mexico’s culinary landscape, proving that legacy and innovation can not only coexist but thrive together.

                                            <p><strong>Opinion</strong><br />
                                            This post comes with some personal emotional baggage, deeply ingrained into my psyche from a young age in the form of some of the most satisfying meals I ever had as a young boy in Mexico. To be honest, I have no idea if the food was actually that good or if it was just my young palate as I have not eaten at one of these restaurants in decades but memories of their meat juice — yes, meat juice, served hot in a cup as a sort of carnivore amuse-bouche — their cuts, their chimichurri sauce, and their <em>cajeta</em> crepes came flooding back as soon as I saw their iconic cow symbol appear in my inbox.<span></span> Designed in 1984, the icon was instantly recognizable and, <a href="https://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/new_logo_and_livery_for_aeromexico_by_wk_mexico.php" target="_blank">like Aeromexico</a>’s old icon, was one of the most emblematic logos of the country so it's great to see its lifespan extended with a few touch-ups that fix some of the clunky issues it had before, mainly the bottom left part of the face where the outer stroke was oddly offset. The horns have also been closed off to better match the treatment of the ears and the eye is now in a slightly better position aligning with the ear. The eye ends up looking a bit small and light so it could have used some visual modulation to better match the thickness of the rest of the icon.<span></span> The old wordmark was not nearly as good or memorable as the icon, with its awkwardly modified-slash-resized Futura type in fake small caps, so the shift into a bold, condensed sans serif with angled flares that match some of the gestures in the icon is a very welcome and appropriate change. I'm not 100% sure if the wordmark is custom from scratch or something straight out of the box (or somewhere in between) but I think the “I” in particular could have been bolder; the “N” and “S” could have been a little wider as the initial “L” and “M” become slightly overpowering; and the “O” could have some extra breathing room but, still, a great evolution. Digging that accent too.<span></span> The identity adds some cool typographic badges highlighting some of the more popular dishes and they have a great, no-nonsense aesthetic while the variety of holding shapes and consistency of typographic hierarchy add up to a great set and they work perfectly on the menu. The dinnerware is very steakhouse-y, white-table-cloth-y, and old-school-y with its use of tradtitional <a href="https://typedrawers.com/discussion/4753/scotch-rules" target="_blank">scotch rules</a> which may not be the most exciting but it's elegant, simple, and effective. Overall, this is a great evolution that maintains the iconic simplicity this brand has had for nearly 40 years and adds to it with the bold new wordmark to match and just the right amount of garnish in the typographic badges to spice things up.</p>

The company carved out their niche of the already niche fume extractor industry by designing functional machines with intriguing sculptural aesthetics. Their <a href="https://www.elica.com/US-en/range-hoods">modern selection</a> is chic and respectable &#8211; within the limited aesthetic range of the modern stainless steel kitchen, these designs somehow manage to evoke very different looks and feels through careful use of subtle angles and modest curves. But Elica has persisted through every era of trendy home decor since the ’70s, which means that their back catalog has some really fun and funky stuff buried in it. If you look through the discontinued stock, you&#8217;ll find kitchen hoods seemingly inspired by anything from <a href="https://www.architonic.com/en/product/elica-ye-island/1271433" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tree branches</a> to <a href="https://www.architonic.com/en/product/elica-35cc-wall-mounted/1271205" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cheese graters</a> to <a href="https://www.architonic.com/en/product/elica-feel-euphoria-wall-mounted/1271338" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gumdrops</a> to <a href="https://www.architonic.com/en/product/elica-star-island/1271412" target="_blank" rel="noopener">disco balls</a>. Their latest flagship, the <a href="https://www.elica.com/US-en/cooktops/with-downdraft/nikola-tesla-flux" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NikolaTesla Flux</a>, is just as creative (if not quite as colorful), a surface-mounted downdraft ventilator which sucks the fumes down into the cooktop itself and negates the need for an overhead hood. At Milan Design Week in April 2024, Elica introduced a new identity designed by the Milan, Italy, office of <a href="https://landor.com/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Landor</a></p>

Elica, global leaders in kitchen air extractors, sought to broaden its reach into the wider kitchen category. Our task was to accommodate this extension, pushing Elica’s brand beyond the concept of “air”, without compromising its unique legacy. Inspired by Elica’s innovative beginnings and the artistic flair of its founder, Ermanno Casoli, we developed an “Artfully Inventive” solution.

<figcaption>Logo evolution.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>For as much as it&#8217;s changed, the logo has stayed fundamentally consistent since its introduction in 1970. Bold geometric lowercase with an accompanying icon, usually some sort of air metaphor. It was a slow series of incremental changes that led to the most recent logo. I really like the icon accompanying the version that persisted from the 70s until 2004, even if I&#8217;m not entirely sure what it&#8217;s meant to represent. It could have been spinning fan blades, it could have been an abstraction of a stovetop burner; whatever it was, it was cool.</p>

<p>2004 lost a lot of cool factor by dropping the abstract icon for a much more literal visual metaphor for ventilation, giving the initial &#8220;e&#8221; a set of comic-book speed lines. The letterforms themselves were also loosened a little, opening up the curve of the &#8220;c,&#8221; rounding out the bowl of the &#8220;a&#8221;, and stretching the whole thing out just enough to look speedy. I would bet money that an italic draft of this logo existed at one point. I don&#8217;t think any of the prior logos were bad, per se, but this one is certainly the weakest.</p>

<p>Ten years later, and Elica asks &#8211; what are the qualities of air when it&#8217;s not a gust of wind from a brand rushing by? 2014 is the answer. Not fast &#8211; light, soft, swirling. The separated icon returns in the form of a gentle twirl of blue flame, hot air rising before being sucked into a fan. Setting aside the awkward red/blue gradient, I appreciate the organic, free-flowing construction of the icon, especially when contrasted against the perfectly rounded, contrast-free wordmark next to it. It looks dated now, but for the social media era of the mid 2010s, having a distinctive icon that could stand alone was a very sensible move, and an inoffensive geometric sans-serif was just the done thing. It occupied the exact right span of ten years and set the stage for the dramatic return-to-form we&#8217;re seeing now in 2024.</p>

<p>There have been a lot of ’70s design revival these last few years, and Landor saw how the wind was blowing and took full advantage. The newest logo isn&#8217;t a direct lift of the original ’70s wordmark, but it takes enough cues that you could easily mix them up if you didn&#8217;t know better. The changes that have been made are mostly positive. I don&#8217;t think any application in the past 50 years has done a perfect job of resolving the tension between the upper terminals where the &#8220;c&#8221; and &#8220;a&#8221; meet, but by rounding in the second story the 2024 logo has come closest. The thinner overall weight givens the letters a little more room to breathe, and small fixes are made to the letter width and ascender heights to bring an overall sense of harmony to the construction. Where every other step along the evolutionary path for Elica has been an incremental step forward, this new logo has taken a few thoughtful steps back and wound up in a better place for it.</p>

<p>As much as I&#8217;d have liked to see them attempt a similar refinement of the visual metaphor for air or a return to some of the abstract 70s iconography, the full-blown graphic identity that it evolved into more than makes up for it.</p>

<blockquote>
The starting point for the brand expression was the square, a shape deeply rooted in Elica&#8217;s past identity. Drawing inspiration from programmed art, we took this foundational shape and adapted it, evolving it in creatively inventive ways. The evolution of the square not only nods to Elica’s history but also symbolises the starting point from which everything else springs. The reinvented square provided an ideal canvas for Elica&#8217;s generative design system, ultimately becoming the super graphic at the centre of Elica’s logo. In doing so, it encapsulates the essence of the kitchen, where Elica profoundly influences people&#8217;s lives.

<p>Replacing the icon is a full dynamic set of gradients, managing to find another dimension to the visual air metaphor &#8211; not fast or light or soft, but breathing.</p>

<p>My first thought whenever I see these types of trippy, wavy gradients are the trippy, wavy graphics that make up the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2vqvR3jB68" target="_blank" rel="noopener">battle screen backgrounds in Earthbound.</a> Which is why I was immediately reminded of the <a href="https://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/new_logo_and_identity_for_zapconnect_2023_done_in_house.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2023 ZapConnect conference</a>, which evoked the same associations when I first saw the identity in January of last year. I wouldn&#8217;t have brought it up at all, because comparison between identities on the basis of something like &#8220;they both use animated gradient ramps&#8221; is never useful. But, looking back, the resemblance is striking, if only for how different the tones set by both identities using the same elements can be.</p>

<p>They convey breathing very effectively, but there&#8217;s not a lot of complex behavior to the patterns. They read as undulating waves equally well when in motion and when static. The website mockups begin to strain credulity with their extremely thin white text on top of the wildy contrasting backgrounds. It would be such a pain to go through and check all of the colors in all of the gradients, but I can tell at a glance that there&#8217;s no way those layouts are <a hraf="https://accessibleweb.com/color-contrast-checker/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WCAG compliant</a>.</p>

<p>The whole system comes together best when the patterns are turned on full-blast, backing up the logo or a bit of copywriting. As effective as the big logo is on the sides of boxes or in solid black layouts, that&#8217;s an old trick and not one Elica can lay claim to. It&#8217;s a nice enough wordmark, but without any of the other elements surrounding it the plainness of it tends to shine through.</p>

<p class="end">The previous logo worked perfectly for the era in which it was made, but looking back at the timeline it becomes apparent that the 2014 rebrand was a dead end. It fell to Landor to sift through 50 years of brand equity and carefully examine all the elements, past and present, to find what worked and what didn&#8217;t and compose something new from the available toolkit. That sort of progressive regression takes a delicate touch, and despite my reservations I can say that I&#8217;m a fan of the identity that Landor landed on.</p>
