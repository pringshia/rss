The color palette, inspired by nature, adds energy to the brand, while the friendly letterforms reflect Linus’s approachable personality. Supporting characters embody different high school archetypes, adding personality and relatability to the experience. These characters, alongside the mascot, create an engaging and memorable SAT prep journey.

                                            <p><strong>Opinion</strong><br />
                                            Given the overwhelming yet understandable drabness <a href="https://satsuite.collegeboard.org/" target="_blank">of the SAT and the College Board</a> “brand”, anything that even remotely improves the experience of preparing, taking, and dealing with the aftermath of it in how much it defines someone's higher education opportunities is most welcome. A slug wasn't top of my list for things that could bring said improvement but I'll gladly let it lead the way. Taking a gamification approach to prepping for the SAT, everything about this takes a playful approach, starting with the name. I have no idea why but “Linus” is hilarious to me — <a href="https://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/linus_members.jpg" target="_blank">no offense to all of the Linuses subscribed to Brand New</a>, on the contrary, I would love to hang out with you. The name, coupled with a slug, whose name I assume is Linus is too much to handle. It's fun, unexpected, and memorable.<span></span> Execution-wise, I love how the slug can exist on its own or take on the role of the “L” in the name. I feel like it's missing an ink trap on its head as the antennae/eyes meet the torso — clearly I do not know the first thing about slug anatomy — to better match the lettering. I see that its tail-end <em>looks</em> like the ink traps and that's a great move but the eyes/head feel a little too plain. The typography is fun and lovingly exaggerated. I wonder if the top of the “i” would have benefitted from a dip that nestles the tittle in order to extend the curviness of the ink traps. Nonetheless, a fun alternative to a dry sans serif that could have easily been the safe choice.<span></span> Not much in application and it feels like neither Lobster Phone nor client knew exactly what to do with the slug beyond it being the logo. The supporting typeface, <a href="https://fonts.adobe.com/fonts/gibson" target="_blank">Gibson</a>, is fine but with very little personality. The app, website, and social media then all turn their attention to a series of cartoon characters that look like the rejects that didn't make the cut for <a href="https://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/new_wordmark_and_identity_for_duolingo_by_johnson_banks.php" target="_blank">Duolingo</a>. They feel too cartoon-ish and too young to appeal to the older teenage range that is taking SATs. Budget probably didn't allow but would have been great to commission characters in a style more similar to the logo. Overall, this feels like two separate projects came together — one with the logo and one with the identity — and maybe it's just a matter of Linus being start-up-y so maybe in due time the two will blend better for an even more effective tool to prep unsuspecting young folk for the SAT.</p>

                                            <p>Established in 1885 by George Frederick Smith in London, <a href="https://www.gfsmith.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GF Smith</a> is a paper merchant that finds and delivers exceptional papers that are tactile in nature, vibrant in color, and distinct in range for use in the design, print, and craft markets. Apart from offering well-known paper brands like Mohawk, Cranes, Gmund, and Strathmore among others, GF Smith&#8217;s own Colorplan line available in a drool-inducing range of colors and weights has become an industry (and UnderConsideration) favorite. Based in Hull, a port city in East Yorkshire, England, GF Smith is a B Corp certified business well-known in the industry for being a super nice and conscious group of people. To wit, the company has reduced its annual CO2 emissions from 760 tonnes of carbon to 200 tonnes since 2018 and they donate 2% of their profits to the GF Smith Charitable Trust that directly supports the Hull community through grants and practical resources. Yesterday, GF Smith introduced a new identity designed by London, UK-based <a href="https://templo.co.uk/work/gf-smith-rebrand" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TEMPLO</a>.</p>

GF Smith’s last major branding project took place in 2014. Since then, the business, the creative sector and the wider world have changed significantly. To reflect the shifts in both the business and its market, and align with its plans for international growth, the company needed a rebrand that would not only cut through the noise and connect with its creative-sector audiences, but which would also support its growing worldwide reach and ambitions, while embodying the character, community, colour and creativity at the company’s core.<br /><br />TEMPLO founders Anoushka Rodda and Pali Palavathanan were inspired by the humanity and warmth of GF Smith, its ‘gently radical’ spirit, and the company’s commitment to environmental and social causes – exemplified by the launch of the GF Smith Charitable Trust. Together, TEMPLO and GF Smith have evolved and elevated the brand, infusing it with energy, colour, playfulness and positivity.

</figure>

<blockquote>
[TEMPLO and GF Smith] identified three truths at the heart of the business that formed the building blocks of the new brand positioning:
<br /><br />
1. Why paper? – The tactile pleasure and permanence of paper as a physical material, as opposed to an ephemeral digital product;
<br /><br />
2. Why GF Smith paper? – The boundless creative possibilities and vivid colours that define the GF Smith paper collections;
<br /><br />
3. Why GF Smith? – The deep sense of community at GF Smith, and its support for its team, its Hull locale, and the creative industries around the world. 
<br /><br />
Taken together, and encapsulated in the phrase ‘GF Smith. Feel good papers’, these three elements are captured in the visual device of GF Smith’s new omni-directional logo, which transforms the letterforms of the brand name into the eyes and smile of a new wordmark. The arrangement and dimensions of the logo allow it to be deployed at multiple orientations – forming connections to, and relationships with, the content surrounding it. Reactive and dynamic, the new symbol is globally resonant while representing a radical departure for the paper sector, bringing the GF Smith name to life in a bold and gently subversive way.

<p>The old logo was excellent and the cornerstone of <a href="https://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/new_logo_and_identity_for_g_f_smith_by_made_thought.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a fantastic identity by Made Thought</a>. I loved the simplicity and cleverness of the dot doubling as the period between the “G” and the “F” — supported, at the time, by the company spelling out its name as “G . F Smith” — and the tittle of the “I” that sat smack in the middle, all in a lovely sans serif. As evidenced by the rest of the identity, the effort back in 2014 was to establish the high-end quality of the papers offered as well as the hands-on customer support the company provided to designers and printers. Ten years is a long time and paper manufacturers and brands have come and gone in that time while GF Smith stands strong, allowing it to take on a new positioning now that the quality of its offering has been established.</p>

<p>As much as it saddens me to see the old logo go, I think this radical new direction is equally excellent as it aims to convey the feel-good vibes and well-meaning nature of GF Smith through a quirky new logo that transforms the name into a smiling face. Face-based and face-inspired <a href="https://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/tag/face" target="_blank" rel="noopener">logos and icons are a dime a dozen</a> so it&#8217;s hard to innovate or feel original when going this route but I think this stands out, thanks in part to the actual name of the company that is naturally read as “G”, pause, “F”, pause, “Smith”, which allows the first two initials to easily stand as the eyes and then “SMITH” as the smile. It&#8217;s simple and almost dumb but it&#8217;s the embracing of that naïveté that works so well and so strongly for me. Like… I know and you know and they know that it&#8217;s silly but they still went for it with gusto and confidence.</p>

<p>Execution-wise, the logo is based on the customized version of <a href="https://blazetype.eu/typefaces/homie" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Homie</a> used in the identity and it looks as if they just plotted the text on a sphere and took whatever the 3D model did with the type, which at times does look a little distorted, particularly the “S”. I could be wrong and maybe they did clean up the letterforms for each of the angles of the face, in which case the “S” could have used a little more modulation. Nonetheless and regardless, I really like logo for its playful energy and its lack of taking itself too seriously.</p>

<blockquote>
Supported by a vibrant, high-contrast colour palette drawn directly from the company’s paper collection, the rebrand is designed to support the GF Smith brand architecture at all levels, embracing and consolidating the organisation’s sub brands and multiple services. These include its iconic coloured paper collection Colorplan, now known as GF Smith Colorplan, the fine-art and digital inkjet paper specialist RK Burt, part of GF Smith and GF Smith Colorflute.

<p>The identity introduces a number of elements and gestures, starting with the broad color palette that may come across as an all-the-colors approach but it&#8217;s actually based on their Colorplan range, which, yeah, it&#8217;s all the colors but if you&#8217;ve ever seen the Colorplan swatchbook all of the colors work beautifully together. Here they are smashed into sometimes jarring combinations but they all look pretty cool and given that one of their main audiences is designers, makes those pairings a less risky choice. Blaze Type&#8217;s customization of its own <a href="https://blazetype.eu/typefaces/homie" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Homie</a> works great in the identity, with the “100gsm” version looking crisp and sharp for longer elements of text and the “1400gsm” version looking like the elegant and sophisticated long-lost sibling of <a href="https://www.myfonts.com/products/ultra-bold-gill-sans-342853?srsltid=AfmBOoqLGfooB1tG2mCsYiIivgS1RZs8VwIvmZ5b6grZw3WYP_zhxarD" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gill Sans Ultra</a> for headline. Lastly, paper textures have been recreated digitally to allow GF Smith to convey the tactility of its product across web and social media uses.</p>

<p>Both the typography and the paper textures are molded into smiles, with the latter being a more subtle effect that I actually think is more interesting and effective than the more literal smiling effect in the typography. Whether subtle or overt, the two moves add some energy and dynamism to the identity.</p>

The introduction of GF Smith’s new brand coincides with the launch of the brand’s new website at gfsmith.com. The new website brings TEMPLO’s vision to full immersive life for GF Smith’s global community of creatives and clients, while giving the brand a platform for sharing creative content, material insight, industry reflections and visions for the future of both GF Smith and the wider sector.
<br /><br />
The core aim of the digital transformation was translating the tactile essence of GF Smith’s papers into a captivating online experience. Building on the brand identity created by TEMPLO, Made by ON has pushed the boundaries of digital design to create a site that feels unmistakably GF Smith. Unexpected animations, expressive typography and immersive textures bring the physical qualities of paper to life on screen, while maintaining optimal performance and usability.

<p>A paper company is a dream client for designers as they can produce a lot of cool, actual stuff given their easy access to source materials and experience with commercial printing so both the half-smile book and the carabiner sampler are excellent examples of taking advantage of this as they bring the identity together in novel AND useful ways. One of our most prized possessions at UCllc headquarters is <a href="https://shop.gfsmith.com/the-collection-2020" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this brick of a swatchbook</a> and – wink, wink TEMPLO and/or GF Smith — I can&#8217;t wait to get my hands on both of these.</p>

<p>All of the images of GF Smith&#8217;s plant in Hull bring me so much joy with all of the new color combinations adorning the walls and leading the way in fun variations. The wayfinding uses the Colorflute product range to form boxes and stack them up in unexpected configurations while big draping textiles keep the cavernous space looking joyful and warm. Also, dig all of the staff uniforms and swag in the various color pairings.</p>

The launch of the new rebrand and site will be marked with a film produced by TEMPLO and filmmaker John Ingle, featuring a bespoke score by Fredwave and sculptures by paper artist Nathan Ward. Colourful, abstract and interwoven with captivating animations, the film explores the unique power of creativity as a way to expand our horizons and escape the challenges of our lives, and celebrates paper as the place where every creative journey begins.

Shar Biggers, who joined the campaign as Deputy Creative Director while Biden was still the nominee and then oversaw the shift to Harris, has put together an exhaustive case study of the actual work that got produced as they campaigned in battleground states and beyond.

For decades, the PRINT RDA was heralded as one of the most prestigious American design competitions, and was a go-to resource for both designers seeking inspiration and creative firms seeking designers. Since then, the <a href="https://www.printawards.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PRINT Awards</a> became global and continues to celebrate design excellence by taking the annual pulse of the industry. The competition has integrated new mediums to evaluate the field&#8217;s ongoing evolution, while still celebrating its founding heritage.&#8221;</p>

Inspired by the theme of biophilia, we developed procedural systems to generate rocks from a base set of geometric forms rather than sculpting each one by hand. This structured procedural approach, combined with organic randomness, strikes a nice balance between the handmade and the natural.<br /><br />The 60-second film serves as the foundation of the design system. Individual scenes and vignettes are repurposed across various activations and deliverables, including social media campaigns and the Print Design Awards website.

                                            <p><strong>Opinion</strong><br />
                                            Welcome to Design Awards Day on Brand New, which ended up being a coincidence as both agencies behind the PRINT and ADC Awards submitted their project last week and I thought it would be funny-slash-interesting to post both of them on the same day. As noted in the pinned comments here and <a href="https://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/new_logo_and_campaign_for_the_104th_adc_awards_by_mullenlowe_design_studio.php" target="_blank">on the ADC Awards' post</a>, these are not paid posts. We get no money from them and it makes no difference to us whether you enter or not.<span></span> So… the old logo and identity, <a href="https://www.thecollectedworks.com/project/print-awards-2024" target="_blank">also designed by The Collected Works</a> — who <em>also</em> designed <a href="https://www.thecollectedworks.com/project/print-awards-2023" target="_blank">the 2023 edition</a> (and might be the best of the bunch) — had a glass refraction theme going that yielded some good eye candy. While the logo in the previous two editions used the publication's primary logo (“PRINT” in a bold sans serif), the 2025 version abandons it altogether in favor of <a href="https://pangrampangram.com/products/playground" target="_blank">PP Playground</a>, a funky, slick, sharp script typeface that is all kinds of cool.<span></span> The ornate nature of the logo is complemented in the identity by some literal ornate nature as some otherworldly rock formations are set in motion to grow grass, flowers, vines, and other flora. It's cool to look at but I have no idea what it has to do with a design awards system. Also, like, I don't need to be prescribed every bit of information and intention behind the work but in none of the applications or promos is there ever any written pay-off for the imagery that would help tie the whole thing together conceptually. Even by eye-candy standards, I think the 2023 and 2024 editions were more compelling, attractive, and had a stop-you-in-your-tracks motion appeal that was more engaging. This, to me at least, isn't <em>that</em> interesting or engaging and it's just completely random.<span></span> Things get even more random with the introduction of wilted-looking flower renders overlaid with thick dots that show some other variation inside… kind of visually cool but, like, why? The one thing that saves these treatments is when PP Playground gets overlaid on them and there is a feeling of more-is-more. There are also some print-inspired dingbats throughout but those feel a little gratuitous, especially in this heavily-3D realm they've created. Overall, this is eye-catching but ultimately lacking significance that, if I were on the fence about spending money to submit a project to the awards, I'm not sure it would sway me to do so.

                                            <p>First held in 1921 by the Art Directors Club of New York, the <a href="https://adcawards.org" target="blank" rel="noopener">ADC Awards</a> is the &#8220;oldest continuously running industry award show in the world&#8221;. The ADC Awards, now part of <a href="https://www.oneclub.org" target="blank" rel="noopener">The One Club For Creativity</a>, commissions a new call-for-entries campaign every year. The 2025 campaign was created by <a href="https://mullenlowedesign.co" target="blank" rel="noopener">MullenLowe Design Studio</a> (MLDS), a new agency inside of MullenLowe US.</p>

<span id="more-302508"></span>

<p>If you want to enjoy this campaign for what it is, don&#8217;t bother reading the review and especially don&#8217;t read the agency supplied text. Just scroll through and look at the visuals.</p>

<blockquote>
    The concept MLDS delivered, &#8220;Be Seen by the Best Eyes,&#8221; cuts through the noise of likes and retweets by focusing on what truly matters: recognition by industry experts whose opinions shape careers and define what&#8217;s next in the creative world.<br><br>In an era where validation often feels like an endless buffet of empty calories, the ADC Annual Awards offer something far more substantial: the discerning eyes of the best creative minds in the world. These are eyes that don&#8217;t just glance but see deeply, evaluating work with the same craftsmanship and care that went into creating it. MLDS captured this ethos in a campaign that dares creatives to make work that&#8217;s impossible to look away from.
    </blockquote>
    <h3>MLDS provided text.</h3>

<p>The goal of the campaign is to get agencies to buy award entries. Does the campaign actually matter for driving entries? Not really, because the ADC Awards are a Big Deal. If the call to entries campaign has a bad year, agencies are still going to enter. But, yes, it does matter because prestige doesn&#8217;t maintain itself, so MLDS has that job to do. The campaign idea is &#8220;Be Seen by the Best Eyes&#8221;. MLDS also wrote that the campaign was &#8220;a chance for us to craft a love letter to the industry we love so much&#8221;. Let&#8217;s see how they did.</p>

    </figure>

<p>Whack an oval around the ADC monogram and you&#8217;ve got an eye, maybe even the <em>best</em> eye because the monogram represents the jury who will be looking at the work. MLDS are on track so far.</p>

<p>The oval&#8217;s stroke is thicker than the strokes in the monogram. I tried making the oval&#8217;s stroke the same width and thought it looked a little better, but I don&#8217;t care too much either way. In the process I noticed the the logo&#8217;s oval has been subtly finessed to make it more eye-like. I appreciate that attention to detail.</p>

    <figcaption>Logo variations.</figcaption>
    </figure>

<p>The logo comes in several configurations. They all look like they could be the last thing on screen after the end credits of a film, which is a perfectly good thing to look like.</p>

<p>The font is <a href="https://www.colophon-foundry.org/typefaces/mabry" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mabry</a> in all caps, tightly tracked and squished to 67% of it&#8217;s actual width, a choice that demonstrates… I dunno – MLDS know how to choose popular fonts and type numbers in the character panel? I&#8217;m not against squishing fonts when there&#8217;s a rationale behind it. I think <a href="https://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/new_logo_and_identity_for_pirate_by_only.php" target="blank" rel="noopener">Pirate.com&#8217;s identity</a> is genius. I&#8217;m rolling my eyes because this looks like trying hard to be cool by trying to look like you&#8217;re not trying hard to be cool. But also Mabry squishes well and maybe they&#8217;re just having fun. Whatever the reason, MLDS made their choice and ran with it. The typography is all squished Mabry, except for this:</p>

<p>The eye gets a solid pupil and becomes a pixel to build &#8220;ADC 104&#8221; radiating ancient computer game loading screen vibes. Don&#8217;t waste time waiting for something to load. It just sits there.</p>

<p>This eye also becomes the building block for some fun, trippy patterns.</p>

    <figcaption>Lots of eyeball patterns.</figcaption>
    </figure>

<p>As the identity develops, the idea of the &#8216;best eyes&#8217; dissipates. It&#8217;s just lots of eyes now. Where is the sense of &#8220;best&#8221;? Maybe in the colours?</p>

    </figure>

<p>It&#8217;s a palette of sort-of primary colours, and primary sort of means best?</p>

<p>When you put all the elements together, it&#8217;s jarring enough to make your whole face vibrate.</p>

<p>I like these layouts. I&#8217;m happy to have my face vibrated. I&#8217;ve commented often on Brand New and more often in my head, that design needs to stop being so nice and find its edge. But what I&#8217;m getting from this campaign so far is lots of edge and little substance. There&#8217;s totally a place for that, except when you state that in &#8220;an era where validation often feels like an endless buffet of empty calories, the ADC Annual Awards offer something far more substantial&#8221;.</p>

<blockquote>The campaign&#8217;s centerpiece? A series of surreal and humorous animated shorts where Pixar meets 90s MTV, brought to life in collaboration with ROOF Studio Brooklyn. Through a blend of craftsmanship and disruptive design, these animations tell the story of those “best eyes” and invite creatives to create work that demands to be seen.</blockquote>

<p>The vignettes are beautifully animated. The contrast between the 3D animation and the garish flat graphics totally works. The patterns are nicely animated. These would make great station idents between shows. They absolutely don&#8217;t tell stories though. Calling them &#8220;humorous&#8221; is a stretch. There&#8217;s no indication that the eyeballs in these videos are the best. They are all the same as each other, looking and moving in unison. Who puts their &#8220;best eyes&#8221; in a gumball machine or a box of takeaway noodles? I guess that&#8217;s why I&#8217;m supposed to be amused. I might be if there was any sense of storytelling.</p>

<p>Now, for the first time since the logo, the campaign delivers the &#8220;best eyes&#8221; instead of just &#8220;eyes&#8221;. It&#8217;s a fitting application of the concept. I appreciate the work it took to get eye photos of 275 jury members. It&#8217;s a shame the ADC Awards website <a href="https://adcawards.org/jury/" target="blank" rel="noopener">doesn&#8217;t</a> use this work. The only place I could find these jury posts in the wild was where jury members posted them on their own socials.</p>

<p>The tone of the &#8220;HEY [AGENCY]…&#8221; line threw me. First, I thought of a coach talking to the long shot kid at tryouts. Second, it seemed kinda wolf-whistly. But the interpretation I eventually landed on and am sticking with is a fan calling out to someone they admire.</p>

<p>Were these admiring posters put up across the road from Jessica Walsh&#8217;s studio? Along the route where Paula Scher and Michael Bierut take their daily constitutional? Maybe (probably) MLDS slapped these posters somewhere random and took photos so they could be featured in case studies and that was the entire OOH portion of the campaign. I&#8217;ll bet you the gold cube I never won that Terri of Terri&#8217;s House of Advertising and Design in Pocatello, Idaho didn&#8217;t find a personalised poster pasted on the wall of the Ford dealership next to her studio.</p>

    <figcaption>Entry guide and posters.</figcaption>
    </figure> 

<p>I downloaded the entry guide. The campaign style doesn&#8217;t make it beyond the cover. There&#8217;s no indication that these posters are used anywhere. The One Club For Creativity scattered a few ADC Awards campaign posts across their socials and added a couple headers to their websites. Unless there was a major email effort I don&#8217;t know about, this seems like a campaign designed primarily for case studies and reviews. Maybe Brand New is one the ADC Awards&#8217; unwitting channels. Buy your entries now, folks. You&#8217;ve got a couple weeks until the late deadline.</p>

<p class="end">So, has this campaign driven entries? I have no idea. Did it show me that, if I enter, my work will be seen by the best eyes? Barely. Is it a love letter to the industry? I&#8217;m not feeling it. It&#8217;s a fairly fun piece of style over substance that&#8217;s easier to enjoy if you don&#8217;t read the agency nonsense.</p>
