                                            <p><strong>Relevant quote</strong><br /><em>Inspired by Arclin’s out-of-the-box approach to thinking and innovating, their new symbol is a nod to a deconstructed cube. The panels imply a subtle momentum that speaks to their continued innovation and commitment to bringing life-changing products to the world. The stenciled wordmark visualizes the relationship between the seen and the unseen. The implied connections of the letterforms speak to the seemingly invisible science that is the backbone of all their products.<br /><br />Showcasing the critical and essential nature of Arclin technologies, their new visual identity is distinctive, striking and exacting. Their sharpened visual system is distinguished by its vibrant use of orange, paired with a daring and masterful type suite. We introduced a new bright orange that is iconic to Arclin and symbolizes their big-hearted nature with warmth and optimism.

                                            <p><strong>Opinion</strong><br />
                                            The old logo was bad, with a kitschy swoosh to function as the crossbar of the “A” along with the wonkiest baseline ever rendered on a sans serif wordmark, all in a dull color palette. The new logo is visually awesome, with many things working in its favor, from the dynamic icon to the stenciled serif to the bright color combination. The rationalization for each of those is a bit on the eye-roll-y side but given that this is a corporate, B2B identity, it gets a pass because those are the kinds of things that work flawlessly in a board room and when they look as good as this, it's easier to forgive.<span></span> The icon is very ambiguous and kind of impossible to derive a meaning from just looking at it but it has a Chase-bank-like corporate-ness to it that works well and the orange color looks as if it was forged by fire. The wordmark is so great, with the stencil notches in just the right places and with a couple of exaggerated ones in the “A” and “N”. The icon set for each of their capabilities that echo the icon are excellent too and a big shoutout for the unconventional mock-up of a stenciled ruler.<span></span> The identity elements are, for lack of a better word, rad. There are some cool orange-red-black gradients, some groovy 3D illustrations, and a daring typeface choice in SM Foundry's <a href="https://s-m.nu/typefaces/stellage" target="_blank">Stellage</a>. The applications are all way cooler than any other materials science providers out there and while I am not familiar with a single other materials science provider, I imagine they don't look like this. As conservative as the rationalization was for the logo, the website is kind of bonkers, in a good way, adopting a relatively in-your-face attitude with big type, punchy graphics, and lots of unexpected UI details. Overall, a great corporate identity that avoids the dryness of the category but also doesn't succumb to making it all friendly and cute and instead doubles down on its scientific rigor and innovation. </p>

                                            <p>Established in 1935, <a href="https://www.jaguar.com/index.html?hide_msb=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jaguar</a> is a prestigious British luxury car manufacturer known for its engineering, iconic models like the E-Type, and a rich heritage in both consumer automotive design and successful performance in professional motorsport. Originally founded as the Swallow Sidecar Company by two motorcycle enthusiasts, William Lyons and William Walmsley (who later left the business), the first Jaguar vehicle appeared in 1935 when the company was named S. S. Cars, changing its name to Jaguar in 1945 due to the popularity of its Jaguar models. For decades, Jaguar has stood as an icon of the automotive world. Now, Jaguar is setting its sights on an electric vehicle future and has completely repositioned the company for it, not just with the infamous new campaign but where and how the brand appears, focusing on exclusive brand stores for clients around the world — the first one being in the heart of the luxury fashion district of Paris, in the 8th arrondissement — instead of traditional dealerships and launching at Miami Art Week instead of a major auto show. The new identity and campaign, as far as I understand, have been created in-house.</p>

<blockquote>A completely transformed Jaguar brand recaptures an ethos to Copy Nothing that can trace its roots back to the words of its founder, Sir William Lyons.<br /><br />Jaguar’s transformation is defined by Exuberant Modernism, a creative philosophy that underpins all aspects of the new Jaguar brand world.  It embraces bold designs, unexpected and original thinking, creating a brand character that will command attention through fearless creativity.</blockquote><h3><a href="https://media.jaguar.com/news/2024/11/fearless-exuberant-compelling-jaguar-reimagined-0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jaguar press release 1 of 2</a></h3>

<figcaption>The infamous spot that started it all.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Not counting Twitter changing to X last year — because that was so out of the ordinary from the typical rollout process of major rebrands — nothing has captured the design, business, marketing, strategy, and branding zeitgeist like Jaguar has done these past two weeks. Airbnb in 2014 and the 2012 London Olympics in 2007 are the only other two projects I can think of that have had a similar impact and ones that we are still talking about 10 and 17 years later. I have no doubt we will be talking about this moment in Jaguar&#8217;s history for years, if not decades. Whether it&#8217;s in a positive or negative light remains to be seen because, for better or worse, yesterday&#8217;s big reveal is inconclusive but we will build up to that as we go through this whole affair together.</p>

<p>After Jaguar unveiled its campaign and new logo on November 19, the internet responded swiftly and vociferously with a collective “WTF?”. While the drastic logo change would have been enough to cause a stir — we&#8217;ll also get into the logo shortly — it was the campaign spot that tested people&#8217;s tolerance for something literally out of the ordinary and unexpected for the automobile category. Heck, even for the fashion industry, this would have been a firecracker.</p>

<p>In case you missed it or need a play-by-play commentary on the above, the spot consists of eight people, which is where all normalcy ends. They are drastically diverse in age, race, and gender; they are dressed in outfits no one in their right mind would wear in public; their hair is styled in phsyics-defying structures; their make-up is… surprisingly restrained; they are strutting around in a dystopian Barbieland-like landscape of rocks accessed by a yellow elevator; and, to many car purists&#8217; chagrin, there was no car in sight to promote, you know, a car brand. The whole spot can be summarized as David Lynch but make it TikTok. If Jaguar wanted to get people&#8217;s attention — and they 100% wanted that — they succeeded with this superb trolling against common sense. Jaguar: 1; Internet pundits: 0.</p>

<blockquote>Exuberant use of colour is a cornerstone of Jaguar’s new brand identity, embedded in its values and its association with art. Primary colours, born from the painter’s palette – yellow, red and blue – are the tonal building blocks, always presented with texture or movement.</blockquote><h3><a href="https://media.jaguar.com/news/2024/11/fearless-exuberant-compelling-jaguar-reimagined-0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jaguar press release 1 of 2</a></h3>

<p>Personally, I was as surprised, baffled, and annoyed by this as the vocal majority. I dislike the way the people are dressed, how they are styled, and I find the whole thing utterly pretentious — a feeling exacerbated by the multiple platitudes expressed in the spot. At the forefront is “Copy Nothing”, which has its charm, mostly due to the fact that it comes from the company&#8217;s co-founder, Sir William Lyons, who (now famously) said “A Jaguar should be a copy of nothing” and, as many others have noted (although mostly in a negative light), it has the pithiness and catchiness of Apple&#8217;s “Think Different”. “Copy Nothing”, for now, is mostly a punchline that almost everyone is scoffing at — not without reason — but it&#8217;s quite possible it could become an iconic tagline. At the very least, it should serve as a galvanizing call for those working on this brand. I bet they love it.</p>

<p>The rest of the sentences — “break moulds”, “create exuberant”, “delete ordinary”, and “live vidid” — are all, actually, pretty strong individually and could easily be powerful, relevant, standalone taglines for many other brands but when they are all cobbled together it&#8217;s one too many self-aggrandizing claims and it comes across as Jaguar being too thirsty to be looked at as a groundbreaking brand, which it may very well turn out to be the case in the long run but, for now, it&#8217;s hard to take them as seriously as they want to be.</p>

<p>In the end, and I think this is what drove most people the most mad, is that no one could stop talking about it even though we all knew that the primary reason this spot was created in this specific style was to get everyone to talk about it. And that it worked. Like gangbusters. Whether we were (and continue to be) talking about Jaguar for the right or wrong reasons is almost irrelevant because Jaguar&#8217;s main goal was to insert itself into a conversation they had been left out of as other luxury and more interesting cars like Audi, Tesla, or Rivian had overtaken the legacy brand. I also think the general sentiment is that most people want to discredit this whole thing as ridiculous and are perhaps hesitant to admit that something so bonkers, so out of control, so <em>off brand</em> could actually be the right move.</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s get to the design stuff.</p>

Inspired by Malcolm Sayer, Jaguar’s designer of the C, D and E‑type who uniquely blended science and art to produce timeless shapes in these cars. The geometric letter forms are rotated to create perfect visual symmetry and balance. It creates a modernist form that spells out the distinguished Jaguar name.</blockquote><h3><a href="https://media.jaguar.com/news/2024/12/jaguar-unveils-type-00-unmistakable-unexpected-dramatic" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jaguar press release 2 of 2</a></h3>

</figure>

<p>The old wordmark was a standard-issue car wordmark: extra extended and non-committal to any particularly strong aesthetic and pretty much devoid of any concept, which is fine… car brand wordmarks have never been a bastion of conceptual thinking. Prior to doing this review, I could not have told you what the Jaguar wordmark looked like and if this one in particular had said CHRYSLER instead, I would have been like “okay”. Point being, there was nothing memorable or distinct about it, which is where the new wordmark excels at. It&#8217;s completely unlike any other car wordmark out there. Or ever.</p>

<p>However, it still maintains what makes car logos distinctive, which is taking up a whole lot of horizontal space but it does so by going extreme on the letter-spacing while maintaining the letters at normal proportions. Adopting a spurless geometric sans aesthetic instead of the extended futuristic and generic sans serif of most other car brands is kind of genius and in the time I have been simmering on this review, I have actually come to like this logo. A lot.</p>

<p>This may be as surprising for some of you to hear as it is for me to say as I have long held a disdain for unicase wordmarks and spurless sans serifs but the mirrored effect of the “j” and “r” as bookends and the symmetry of the “a”s is something that would have been impossible to do if they had followed standard uppercase conventions instead of attempting to do something that is genuinely different and original. Sure, it doesn&#8217;t have the quintessential elegance one would expect but I think there is a bold and confident sophistication to this logo that will not only stand the test of time but will surely yield imitators.</p>

<p>Another significant change is the evolution of the leaping jaguar icon, which I think derives more cachet from <a href="https://www.google.com/search?sca_esv=bc90c0cb48f9edae&#038;sxsrf=ADLYWIKwCJuullgFLpWWUNpl_LqkKbyJQw:1733273563447&#038;q=jaguar+hood+ornament&#038;udm=2&#038;fbs=AEQNm0Aa4sjWe7Rqy32pFwRj0UkWd8nbOJfsBGGB5IQQO6L3J03RPjGV0MznOJ6Likin94qcHocyJKwCAY-xJrP2wTDRcznSnsW3hhhfn3BzcpvBM2DgnnNI_IygPci95fC7vZcGb7QowLV1qCl49tTx2GCA3zj0wl38pyF4zKR461qvYosXfY6nGony5sE-vdBzZ3rIChjiFnWxZ9U0gVu2Jd2yWEtG1A&#038;sa=X&#038;ved=2ahUKEwil4rCY84yKAxXVC3kGHcoHJbEQtKgLegQIFRAB&#038;biw=1532&#038;bih=1096&#038;dpr=2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">its physical manifestation as a hood ornament</a> than it does from its graphic representation because, let&#8217;s face it, it&#8217;s never been great. The most bad-ass version was the most literal one rendered in chrome and none of the others are particularly representative of a luxury brand — by association, yes, but by execution, no. The new leaping jaguar is excellent as it abandons any detailing in its limbs, muscles, and facial expressions to just focus on the silhouette, which benefits from more than 40 years of said association. Sure, it gives some <a href="https://www.google.com/search?sca_esv=bc90c0cb48f9edae&#038;sxsrf=ADLYWIJomEzYDVS76vr0DckdJifSegxVCA:1733273871521&#038;q=puma+logo&#038;udm=2&#038;fbs=AEQNm0Aa4sjWe7Rqy32pFwRj0UkWd8nbOJfsBGGB5IQQO6L3J03RPjGV0MznOJ6Likin94qcHocyJKwCAY-xJrP2wTDRdZ3nMFQHd3jFXJcLoqizi5vU2ji-LmtqvJ_3_ROFi7LV4d4IH0_81Bc2XF8q6MNtJ96-I6hdqwj7XZUcTEFTKuiRwlPzFNrwc-jRboZworYEK1ZbhEIliGJmoWtdWe4yqKwdbw&#038;sa=X&#038;ved=2ahUKEwjOh6Sr9IyKAxWpAHkGHaSRKsoQtKgLegQIOhAB&#038;biw=1532&#038;bih=1096&#038;dpr=2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Puma</a> now but its streamlined contour and angled features make it fairly distinctive. Another distinctive feature of the new leaper is that it always appear within stripes, which is a recurring motif not just in the identity but also in the car and has been nicknamed as the “Strikethrough”. I kind of dig it and I think when you see it in action in the ingots on the car&#8217;s side, you might join me in its appreciation.</p>

<blockquote>The new monogram replaces the ‘Growler’ that represented the sound of combustion engines of the past. The new monogram is a discreet artistic motif that incorporates the ‘j’ and the ‘r’ from opposite ends of the device mark. The term ‘opposite’ signifies our approach to do things differently and defy electric vehicle convention. </blockquote><h3><a href="https://media.jaguar.com/news/2024/12/jaguar-unveils-type-00-unmistakable-unexpected-dramatic" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jaguar press release 2 of 2</a></h3>

<p>Here is where my enthusiasm wavers a bit. I think there is something clever and, again, unexpected about making a monogram out of the first and last letters of a name but given how well the “j” and the “r” from the logo work as an ambigram, there is something I like about it but as a monogram for a luxury brand, I don&#8217;t think it has the finesse to pull it off. There is also some disappointment that this monogram is the replacement of the “Growler” icon that has appeared in a myriad ways over the years. It doesn&#8217;t feel like an even trade.</p>

<blockquote>Introducing an unmistakable, unexpected and dramatic physical manifestation of Jaguar, as the brand continues its transformation. Type 00 (pronounced Type Zero Zero) embodies Jaguar’s creative philosophy of Exuberant Modernism following the debut of its new brand identity.<br /><br />The world premiere of the design vision concept at Miami Art Week – as South Florida becomes the centre of the art world for six‑days – previews what’s to come from Jaguar, as the brand recaptures the original ‘Copy Nothing’ ethos of its founder, Sir William Lyons.</blockquote><h3><a href="https://media.jaguar.com/news/2024/12/jaguar-unveils-type-00-unmistakable-unexpected-dramatic" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jaguar press release 2 of 2</a></h3>

<blockquote>Just as a pair of E‑types attended its 1961 launch at the Geneva Motor Show, the reveal of Type 00 celebrates two contrasting interpretations of Jaguar’s new design vision. A Satin Rhodon Rose example – dubbed ‘Miami Pink’ in honour of the pastel colours of the city’s iconic Art Deco architecture – is inspired by the distinctive rose colour that brass takes on as it ages. It is joined by a striking Inception Silver Blue model. Dubbed ‘London Blue’, it is inspired by the Opalescent Silver Blue of the 1960s and was chosen to reflect Jaguar’s British heritage.</blockquote><h3><a href="https://media.jaguar.com/news/2024/12/jaguar-unveils-type-00-unmistakable-unexpected-dramatic" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jaguar press release 2 of 2</a></h3>

<blockquote>The confident new face combines upright, flush surfaces with the new Jaguar device mark at its centre. A distinctive and precise front light signature emphasises the corners of the car, giving width and grounding it.<br /><br />The side profile is dominated by bold proportions, with the Jaguar ‘leaper’ laser‑etched into a hand‑finished brass ingot on each side of the car. These ingots theatrically deploy to reveal rear‑facing cameras that – like the charging ports and front air intakes – remain hidden until needed.</blockquote><h3><a href="https://media.jaguar.com/news/2024/12/jaguar-unveils-type-00-unmistakable-unexpected-dramatic" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jaguar press release 2 of 2</a></h3>

<p>Finally, we get to the actual car, which was revealed on Monday night during Miami Art Week. When I first saw the initial images above, I was heavily disappointed. Not because of the design of the car — I&#8217;m not a car buff so I don&#8217;t have the foundation to have any strong opinions about it — but because of the way it was presented. The car looks airbrushed in (or at least digitally rendered) into the Barbie Rock Flatlands, which at first I thought was a copout but this is the <em>actual</em> texture of the car and it&#8217;s wild. Even in the official presentation (included towards the end of this post) I thought the cars were digitally added to the stage, because they almost look like holograms. Whether this is the actual finish of the real car when it launches remains to be seen but, damn, it&#8217;s nice.</p>

<p>Having stated that my opinion on the car is mostly unsubstantiated I&#8217;ll still relay my feelings about it because I do have eyes and I can appreciate a nice car when I see it but I also don&#8217;t have the intense sentimentality many Jaguar fans have for the old models, so I don&#8217;t hate the Type 00 as a knee-jerk reaction. I actually don&#8217;t hate it all but I also don&#8217;t find it jaw-dropping in any way — especially not in the way that an E-Type continues to do more than 60 years later. Like, it&#8217;s fine. I also get some Cybertruck vibes from it but the Cybertruck was so outlandish that it made a bold, dramatic statement and this one, despite all the build-up, just doesn&#8217;t.</p>

<blockquote>The rear continues the bold statement. A glassless tailgate and panoramic body‑harmonised glazed roof create a sense of sculpture. The rear elevation is defined by distinctive horizontal Strikethrough graphics, which hide dramatic full‑width taillights and emphasise the power and scale of Type 00.</blockquote><h3><a href="https://media.jaguar.com/news/2024/12/jaguar-unveils-type-00-unmistakable-unexpected-dramatic" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jaguar press release 2 of 2</a></h3>

<p>Despite my lukewarm reaction to the overall appearance of the car, there are some killer details, particularly the aforementioned ingots with the leaper icon that flare out of the body to reveal the rear-facing cameras. While I&#8217;m not a fan of the monogram, it does look kind of bad-ass on the wheels (and the steering wheel) with its subtle rising from its holding mechanism. I guess we also need to talk about the colors… “London Blue” and “Miami Pink”… once more, Jaguar has gone the unconventional route and I hate to admit it but I dig them both. Don&#8217;t get me wrong, it&#8217;s not the timeless elegance of the racing green of the past but it&#8217;s great to see something other than black or silver.</p>

<blockquote>Jaguar’s design team explored new ways of enhancing the interior. Occupants can tailor the cabin to suit their mood using the uniquely crafted Prism case. The objective of this feature is for occupants to engage with the vehicle and extend the concept of customisation and personalisation. It stows behind an exquisitely engineered powered door on the bodyside and contains three totems of natural materials – Brass, Travertine and Alabaster.<br /><br />Placing one of the totems inside the centre console tailors the mood of the interior. Everything, from the ambient lighting and unique soundscape to the tailored screen graphics, reflect the properties of the chosen material. Bespoke scents interact with the materials for unprecedented personalisation.</blockquote><h3><a href="https://media.jaguar.com/news/2024/12/jaguar-unveils-type-00-unmistakable-unexpected-dramatic" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jaguar press release 2 of 2</a></h3>

<blockquote>A pair of dramatic butterfly doors and ‘pantograph’ tailgate open to reveal a modernist interior that shares its exuberant proportions with the exterior. The awe‑inspiring cabin features three hand‑finished brass lines which run the length of the interior, with a central 3.2m‑long brass spine that splits a pair of floating instrument panels.<br /><br />Soothing travertine stone functions as a plinth, supporting the floating seats and central spine. It inspires the rich layered tonal colour palette of the interior. Woven textiles add to the sense of craftsmanship. A tactile wool blend, inspired by handwoven yarns, envelops the two seats, sound bar and flooring. </blockquote><h3><a href="https://media.jaguar.com/news/2024/12/jaguar-unveils-type-00-unmistakable-unexpected-dramatic" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jaguar press release 2 of 2</a></h3>

<p>I would normally not quote as many things related to the car but the writing is so out of control in describing the features that I could not resist including them. The interior looks like a Finnish sauna. I find it to be the most uninviting car interior I have seen in some time.</p>

<p>So, there you have it. After two weeks of fierce build-up, was the hype and wait worth it? Sadly, and perhaps a little infuriatingly: No, it wasn&#8217;t. While I have found myself praising the visual aspect of this far more than I expected, I could have done without all the theater and without the Messiah complex of Jaguar liberating us from decades of automative standards. This could have been a far more successful relaunch if they had dialed down the pretentiousness. This is actually what I dislike the most about the new Jaguar brand: its tone of voice is INSUFFERABLE. Everything from the platitudes in the campaign to the script of McGovern&#8217;s presentation to the press releases is obnoxiously over-confident and self-congratulatory. If they had just shut up and let the car and the brand do the talking with a modicum of modesty I think this would have been infinitely more successful and better received.</p>

<p class="end">The one main question that remains is who the hell is the audience for this new positioning and persona because it&#8217;s definitely not the traditional, affluent, James-Bond-wannabe male of yore. By staking its territory in the art and fashion world, it makes this question even harder to answer and the answer might actually be kind of sad because the audience is either young, super-affluent social media influencers or <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-11-21/cattelan-duct-taped-banana-sells-for-6-2-million-at-sotheby-s-auction" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the type of person that would pay $6.2 million for a banana taped to a wall</a>. Time will tell who wants to align themselves with breaking moulds, creating exuberant, deleting ordinary, and living vididly.</p>

                                            <p>Jim Pons, who designed the logo used by the NFL&#8217;s New York Jets from 1978 to 1998 while employed as the team&#8217;s film and video director, has filed a lawsuit asking a federal court to A) grant him the copyright to the logo; B) to punish the team, along with the NFL, in violation of that copyright; and C) get a share in the revenue that the team and the league generate through the sale of merchandise with the logo. The USPTO had previously rejected Pons’ petition to copyright the logo. The legal battle has more at stake given that the team re-introduced Pons&#8217; logo as its primary one beginning this season. <a href="https://www.newyorkjets.com/news/jets-logo-new-uniforms-jim-pons" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A lengthy post on the Jets&#8217; website</a> went in-depth into Pons&#8217; contribution and Pons himself sounded happy the logo was coming back. Given that he was an employee at the time probably kills any chances he would have at getting the copyright.

                                            <p><strong>Relevant quote</strong><br /><em>Whilst their business offer was clear, Karnival needed help communicating exactly what it is that makes them unique. They needed a brand with a more defined point of view that would help lift them above the sector noise and really target their audiences. Something that would resonate with the traders they work with whilst also appealing to the corporate clients they cater to.<br /><br />They provide the convenience of delivery with the theatre and atmosphere of the market. It was this ability to literally deliver more than any of their competitors that led us to our brand idea.<br /><br />To help bring our idea to life we leant into the rich visual world of street food – layering up elements inspired by packaging, stickers, menus and receipts to create a vibrant visual tapestry that perfectly represents the melting pot that is the London street food scene. Hand-drawn stickers and turned-up corners overlay rugged wrappers and vivid photography. The colour palette balances the muted tones of earthy ingredients and packaging with the vibrancy of fresh fruit and veg. And the the bold, robust typeface acts as a constant thread tying the flexible system together.<br /><br />To help anchor an identity system that is varied and vibrant by design, we worked with lettering artist Oli Frape to develop a signature for Karnival. Reflecting the scrawled handwriting of traders quickly jotting down orders or scribbling names, the signature is an understated symbol of authenticity and personalisation that resonates with traders and clients alike.

                                            <p><strong>Opinion</strong><br />
                                            The old logo was a more literal interpretation of the name with its ticket stub holding shape, which was a decent idea but wasn't executed particularly well with its fuzzy inline typography overpowered by a very heavy stroke around it. The new logo is a more ambiguous interpretation of the company's offering that aims to capture mobile food vendors' handwriting as they write down orders or scribbling names on takeout boxes and bags. It's a valid concept but the execution is way too nice… no food vendor writes that nicely and by that I don't mean that food vendors aren't capable of nice handwriting but their fast-paced environment isn't the most conducive for flawless script writing. This is a really odd way of praising the logo, as the lettering is actually lovely and really well executed but, for the intended purpose of the concept, it's a little too slick and reading the word “carnival” in that style is a bit of a dead-end… like there is no payoff between name and logo. But, again, lovely piece of lettering.<span></span> The identity also had a strong idea in “layering up elements inspired by packaging, stickers, menus and receipts to create a vibrant visual tapestry that perfectly represents the melting pot that is the London street food scene” but I feel like they didn't push this enough to be more chaotic and less pristine. I understand that, in the end, the audience are businesses and corporations hiring a catering service not a grungy food truck but the elements at play don't seem as authentic as they could be… like, the patterns are just vector elements with a halftone texture; the typography is too straightforward; and the compositions are maybe two or three layers short of more “stuff” to feel more purposely dense. Still, there are some really nice moments in this, like the first image in the advertising bundle or the Instagram stories where there is a fun, layered effect with lots of textures going on. The spot illustrations in the stickers are also quite good. Overall, despite me wanting them to go up to 11 on food-related messiness, for a corporate catering company this is actually just the right amount of grunge, chaos, and ruggedness before one might start having second thoughts about hiring them.</p>

Founded in 1925, the chain started as a single counter at the beer factory located on Almirante Reis Avenue in Lisbon, which served draught beer and snacks while customers waited for their beer barrels to be filled. Now with over 40 stores, the company has expanded to two sister chains. The Portugália Cervejaria (&#8220;Brewery&#8221;) restaurant chain is a reservation-style sit-down brewery. And at the Portugália Balcão (&#8220;Balcony&#8221;) chain, the steaks and prawn are &#8220;prepared with the same rigor and passion, but are served quickly in smaller portions at pocket-friendly prices&#8221;. In preparation for their upcoming 100th-year celebration, Portugália invited Azeitão, Portugal-based <a href="https://www.farelo.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Farelo Studio</a> to revisit they brand&#8217;s graphic identity in partnership with <a href="https://luismileu.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Luis Milieu Studio</a>.</p><span id="more-300564"></span>

<blockquote>
Portugália&#8217;s brand was born out of the need, in 1916 and with anti-German sentiment, to break with the name of the Germania factory, and evolve into a deeply patriotic name.
<br /><br />
The original symbol reproduces the Portuguese coat of arms, with 7 castles and 5 corners, surrounded by a shield, in a set that imprisons the brand in the past, unable to incorporate new meanings.

<figcaption>OLD identity.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The old identity had a lot of design features working against it, particularly for a digital landscape. In the logo, the subtle gradients become washed out at small sizes, and the extended typefaces forced limited placements, requiring a lot of valuable white space. Yet, I think the biggest miss is programmatically, where there is an overall lack of art direction. Different design styles, compositions, treatments, graphics are all held together with a heavy dose of blue. Without a memorable visual anchor the results feel dated, redundant, and boring.</p>

<blockquote>
The logo incorporates the shield into the typography, thus freeing itself from carrying the weight of national weapons. The personalized typography, inspired by the lines of the shield, maintains a connection to it, while the extended style works as an allusion to the breadth of the new brand.
<br /><br />
The new brand wants to reflect the Portugal of today, cosmopolitan, open to the world, and full of diversity.

<figcaption>NEW logo.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The new logo is a refreshing change that simplifies the complicated logo into a straight-forward, geometric text-based lockup. A modified <a href="https://fonts.adobe.com/fonts/termina" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Termina</a> reimagines the wordmark that is highlighted by some custom curves in the &#8220;R&#8221; and &#8220;A&#8221; letters. These changes offer a welcome touch of personality. The most notable modification is transforming the &#8220;O&#8221; into a shield shape. The following &#8220;U&#8221; mimics the same shape, but with an open top edge. Below, the &#8220;Cervejaria&#8221; and &#8220;1925&#8221; form a second line of text, which is set in Termina.</p>

<p>The resulting logo is quite pleasant. There is a nice rhythm throughout the characters, and the hard top edge creates a crisp line. Moving the shield into the word mark is a clever solution to simplify the elements. While the shield will appear throughout the rest of the identity, this move cleans up the logo, and in doing so creates a friendly, modern expression. I will acknowledge that at first look the &#8220;O&#8221; caught my curious eye, but it was not enough to create any readability issues. (Also, it is a 99-year old brand, so it can leverage its name recognition).</p>

<blockquote>
The new symbol has a revised and simplified Portugueseness. The shield remains the standout element but is more minimalist and open to new uses and meanings.
<br /><br />
By placing the founding date as a central element, the brand celebrates its history, but now in a minimalist and contemporary graphic format.

<p>The shield is a nice supporting element that maintains the straight-forward approach. Using a simple stroke to form a beefy shield, the shape creates a perfect container for &#8220;1925&#8221;. I appreciate the restraint in not decorating the shield with additional elements. This allows the 100-year mark to have its own moment, and provides the flexibility (and scalability) that was missing previously.</p>

<blockquote>
The shield is the central element and catalyst of the brand. Combining and recombining, it unfolds and multiplies, generating a whole new graphic universe, infinite, simultaneously nostalgic and modernist.

<figcaption>Graphic language.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Here is where things start to get interesting. The shield is used with other geometric shapes to create a dynamic graphic system. With the addition of cyan, blues, gold, and burnt orange the patterns provide a visual identifier that can be applied across instances. I really like the ambiguity in the shapes&#8230;from faces to animals to the spaces in-between. My eye wants to keep scanning for something to be revealed in a counter space.</p>

<p>A secondary typeface, <a href="https://fonts.adobe.com/fonts/acumin" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Acumin Pro</a>, is also introduced. This pairs well with Termina, serving as a more condensed type that works better for body copy.</p>

<p>The animations provide some additional moments of fun. I particularly like the intro and outro graphics in the above animation.

<p>The examples above show how different elements can come together, particularly in the Instagram stories. The patterns and colors are combined with photography and copywriting by <a href="https://www.instagram.com/semfiltro/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ricardo Henriques</a>. This is a nice mark of distinction for a food service brand that allows them to offer a wider range of content, beyond the more common route of menu item glam shots. Some of the stories translate (with the help of Google) to &#8220;Croquette or shrimp, with the fork or with the hand&#8221; and &#8220;Of the recurring lunch and the surprising reunion&#8221;.</p>

<blockquote>
To make the brand present inside the store without the exhaustive repetition of the logo, we designed a family of five tiles based on the shape of the shield, extruded and with different inclinations. Combined, they create a random, busy, and festive pattern, as any brewery should be.

The graphic language of the new brand gains a new expression in Portugália Balcão, the brand’s spin-off for food courts, with the graphic tiles, designed on a quadrangular grid, in a single shade of blue, for reproduction on traditional Portuguese tiles.

<p>The tiles for the Balcão stores, translate the chunkiness of the above into something that is more manageable at scale. Yet, they do not at all feel &#8220;less than&#8221; the others. Instead, they situate themselves between the initial graphic patterns and the tiles to create yet another translation of the core identity elements. Bonus points for another &#8220;making of&#8221; video.</p>

<p>The beer glassware shows how strong the shield starts to feel in application. Despite its simplicity, it works surprisingly well to establish itself. Great photography helps too.</p>

<p>Building out the space includes the store signage. The exterior signage might feel a bit underwhelming, but it works well enough. I feel like there might have been a missed opportunity to introduce one more unexpected or fun translation of the identity, perhaps a scalloped edge to the awnings that match the shield in the top example, like they did with the vinyl graphic in the second location.</p>

<p>The patterns return in the takeout containers and the tote bag. Both show an attention to detail that elevates the items. I like how the simple pattern on the boxes is just offset enough to create a rhythm. And the tote is fantastic; it is absolutely tote I would use. Across these examples, what I like most is how the shield shape appears and disappears. It is both the visible and invisible identifier that establishes the identity.</p>

<p>I think if anything, my critical eye wants the logo to be a bit more prominent on the building posters. I know that I stood up for the brand being allowed to be a little daring, because of its legacy. But because the visual program is such a divergent turn, I feel here if anywhere, might be the best place to reintroduce its audience to the new look.</p>

<p>It is interesting to see so much advertising for food, without showing the food. But here we are, at the end of the post and no featured food photography. I don&#8217;t mean that as a bad thing, just particularly uncommon for an American reviewer. Yet I appreciate the approach. It feels light. It feels fun. And most importantly, it catches my eye.</p>

<p class="end">Overall there is a lot to love in this program. I love the tiles. I love the visual assets. And, most importantly, I love how it all comes together. It is delightful because everything is an extension of the core elements tucked within the logo. Everything extends from one place. When this approach works, it allows for these wonderful explorations across materials and compositions. Allowing the program to instinctively offer variety and to hold our attention. I give credit to the design direction. I hope this identity will sustain Portugália for the next 100 years.</p>
