That&#8217;s right: A few licks after removing a protective film will reward people with “the taste of KFC’s Original Recipe Chicken with a refreshing hit of cranberry sauce and aromatic pinch of sage”. The promo, sold-out naturally, was created in collaboration with <a href="https://www.instagram.com/soldierboyfriend/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SOLDIER</a>. Better than the product itself are the product disclaimers at the link.

                                            <p><strong>Relevant quote</strong><br /><em>Order looked to the original visual representation of KGNU’s signage and identity, circa the early ’80s, as the foundation for the revitalized brand. The refreshed brand language leverages typography from the station’s founding. This typographic voice is amplified to serve as both a functional identifier and a graphic element in representing music and news programming.<br /><br />LL Supreme Bold and Light, by Lineto, are used for legibility and clarity in the brand. Their construction mirrors the geometry of LL Cobra VIP. LL Cobra VIP, also by Lineto, is used as the primary identification of the logo, and as a graphic support to the extended brand language.<br /><br />Extending from the logo typeface, LL Cobra VIP, graphic devices are used as a means for the in-house team to easily create illustrative accompaniments to the fast-turnaround in programming. The three categories of devices allude to the process of broadcasting to the station’s audiences: broadcasting the program, transmitting the audio to radios, and radios receiving the transmission.

                                            Needless to say, the old logo was not good, with far too many things going on and a cringy execution all around. The new logo manages to keep some of the geometric essence from the old one, while pulling in some extra flair <a href="https://order-site-images-dev.imgix.net/b147b5e2-d5ab-48b2-b9ee-700a922e6b6e/KGNU_WEBSITE_ASSETS_4.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&amp;fit=min&amp;fm=jpg&amp;q=70&amp;rect=0%2C0%2C9150%2C6100&amp;w=2200" target="_blank">from the station's original logo</a>, and deliver a fun new take on the four letters with the choice of Lineto's <a href="https://lineto.com/typefaces/cobra-vip" target="_blank">Cobra VIP</a> — the logo is actually customized from it as the typeface only exists in lowercase. The “G” ends up looking a bit small and the “K” a bit too big but such are the sacrifices one has to make when adopting strict geometry. It's still a very pleasing logo, though, with all the geometric bits and pieces Voltroning into a solid composition. Bonus points for the sonic logo matching the construction of it.<span></span> The identity revolves around more Cobra VIP — and, honestly, I'll take as much Cobra VIP as will be given to me — paired with <a href="https://lineto.com/typefaces/supreme" target="_blank">Supreme</a>, also from Lineto, for a classy-vintage-y-yet-contemporary aesthetic. Cobra VIP gets one more opportunity to shine as abstract backgrounds in three different compositions styles, which are kind of ambiguous as to how they each represent the three different categories of “Broadcasting”, “Transmitting”, and “Receiving” but they do provide some guidance and a framework for the in-house team to choose which one to use for what. The applications are all a pleasant mix of type, pattern, photography, and color in that orderly aesthetic of Order and the system is almost exhaustingly versatile. (I included a fraction of the applications on their case study because, as nice as they all are, it can actually be too much of a good thing.) Overall, this is a crisp and comprehensive identity that celebrates the nearly-lost-art of radio and its vintage, simpler-times appeal.</p>

<h1 class="friday_likes">Razz by Velvele Studio</h1>

<p style="margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;"><a href="https://www.instagram.com/razz.burger/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Razz</a> is a quick-service burger joint in İzmir, Turkey, where patrons can choose from predetermined burger combos or they can fully customize their own, from the choice of meat to the condiments. The identity, designed by Milan, Italy-based <a href="https://velvele.studio/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Velvele Studio</a>, doesn&#8217;t appear to have any strong conceptual hook other than making the letters in the logo look like thick burger patties and/or doughy buns, which is good enough for me. It&#8217;s a fun logo. They maybe have a little too much fun with it by distorting it into a circle shape in some uses… if they had redrawn it manually, maybe it would have worked better than what looks like a simple Envelope Distort in Illustrator. Still, that extruded version in the sign makes up for it. The green color is probably going to split the room into whether it&#8217;s appetizing or not… I dig it. Like, it doesn&#8217;t make me hungry but it&#8217;s definitely not going to stop me from enjoying what look like kick-ass burgers.  <span class="pagination_divider"></span><span class="small_caps"><a href="https://velvele.studio/work/razz" target="_blank" rel="noopener">See full project</a></span></p>

<h1 class="friday_likes">Madrasta by Armando Gomes (for Judas)</h1>

<p style="margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;"><a href="https://www.instagram.com/madrasta.restaurante" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Madrasta</a> (the Portuguese word for stepmother) is a restaurant in Paço de
Arcos on the Lisbon Coast in Portugal serving a Mediterranean menu. The identity, designed by Lisbon, Portugal-based <a href="https://iamfromlx.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Armando Gomes</a> — while employed at Judas (which has no digital presence at the moment) — takes a cue from the restaurant&#8217;s <a href="https://grupononbasta.pt/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/BP1A3237-scaled.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unique modular, geometric features</a> to introduce a… well… unique, modular, geometric logo that appears to use Dinamo&#8217;s <a href="https://abcdinamo.com/typefaces/galapagos" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Galapagos</a> as a starting point. It&#8217;s quirky, it&#8217;s playful, and, in its red and green color combination, it&#8217;s also a bit electric. The extra spaces in the logo can be a little distracting and they don&#8217;t really add much but they do provide some additional modularity to the system. The star of the project though is the gridded, short-sleeve button down with the logo repeated on it. <span class="pagination_divider"></span><span class="small_caps"><a href="https://iamfromlx.com/Madrasta" target="_blank" rel="noopener">See full project</a></span>

<h1 class="friday_likes">Chandigarh Café by Dennis</h1>

<p style="margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:30px!important;"><a href="https://www.instagram.com/chandigarhcafe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chandigarh Café</a> is an overly charming café and restaurant in Barcelona, Spain, that offers, also, a Mediterranean menu but with a French spin, thanks to its chef, Hervé Escobar. The restaurant is housed in a 1950s charmer of a house that nicely ties in with the name of restaurant, which is inspired by the city in India, <a href="https://www.google.com/search?sca_esv=87ab822241439fb3&#038;sxsrf=ADLYWII9CFxkHWbawc_RE5-HYwkyI_MLlQ:1734088208956&#038;q=Chandigarh+india&#038;udm=2&#038;fbs=AEQNm0Aa4sjWe7Rqy32pFwRj0UkW1DRbm01j6DCVS0r1sTxn7h_rt6mVhwDmwtd3hPZjM8xOYJM4hmmrxWbUY3sD5VWIMokj2y_vGi8fBpFPuBNa8hz4Li0jj_jR95F_P7TRXoz1_1czWVCK2r7AVMe-2AJv68T3e8ks-FkqvSCyKg_VRMpSDaAtUyNGf11siL50Sb-jeqHuPOTj28B3ejbm7-I1baovHQ&#038;sa=X&#038;ved=2ahUKEwiS0dD9zaSKAxUYADQIHSHJNHAQtKgLegQIFhAB&#038;biw=1674&#038;bih=1128&#038;dpr=2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">which was designed by Le Corbusier</a>, which informed the design of the logo by local firm <a href="https://dennis.studio/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dennis</a>. Blocky in all the right ways, the logo is offset by perfectly circular counterspaces and playfully accentuated, literally, by the accent over the “E” and the tittle over the “I”. There is not much to the identity but with a logo this fun not much is needed. What attracted me most to the project was the sign outside the restaurant which at first I assumed was a render but, nope, it does float just a few inches off of the stone wall it sits on and it is magical. Well, I mean, it&#8217;s not magic… <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/Cf3r8KiIizR/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">it was installed by 27Lletres</a>. <span class="pagination_divider"></span><span class="small_caps"><a href="https://dennis.studio/project/chandigarh-cafe" target="_blank" rel="noopener">See full project</a></span></p>

It was first introduced in 1983 for use with automated teller machines. The network is owned by the Rome-based Bancomat, S.p.A. and its cards are issued by Italian banks. The service is only used in Italy and the word “bancomat” is used in Italy as a synonym for automated teller machine. Since the Bancomat network is not used outside Italy, almost every Bancomat/PagoBancomat debit card is co-branded with a multinational service, such as Mastercard, Maestro, Visa, Visa Electron or V Pay, for use abroad.&#8221; (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bancomat_(interbank_network)" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wikipedia</a>)</p>

                                            <p><strong>Opinion</strong><br />
                                            It's kind of amazing that, 41 years later, the logo remains pretty much the same as the original logo from 1983. I mean, obviously, <a href="https://www.museodelmarchioitaliano.it/en/bancomat-2/" target="_blank">there have been changes and evolutions</a> but the premise has remained the same: A seagull — “to evoke the freedom of withdrawal and payment outside bank opening hours” — abstracted into a “B” monogram and an all-uppercase, italic wordmark. The previous one was perhaps a little forced as it used the monogram as the initial letter, detracting some strength from it while making the full wordmark all fuzzy and complicated. The addition of the green, white, and red stripes for the Italian flag were unnecessary but I guess warranted given how integral Bancomat is in the country. (“Bancomat” has become a genericized trademark with most people calling ATMs Bancomats.)<span></span> The new logo is a great evolution that returns the “B” monogram to its rightful place outside the wordmark and is given a more aerodynamic design that also emphasizes a “B” shape more strongly. The wordmark is great, with some funky tapering going on in unexpected places, making it look friendly and approachable but also bank-y enough to instill confidence. The essence of the wordmark is translated into an excellent condensed grotesque with some really nice curvature to the overall structure of the characters and it looks great typeset tightly across all applications. The numerals are particularly nice.<span></span> Things get a little too playful in the applications as a wide-angle-slash-bird’s-eye-view perspective is applied to the imagery, video, typography, and 3D spot illustrations. While I don't personally like the approach, I appreciate the looseness it brings to the identity and how it is reinforced by the pithy copywriting. The one odd thing might be the secondary color palette outside of the blues, which feels somewhat random and not as complimentary (and/or complementary). Overall, not being local, I get the sense that this was a brand that was taken for granted given its ubiquity and I imagine was seen as more functional than aspirational so this identity infuses some energy and personality into it.</p>

Founded by programmer, entrepreneur, and philanthropist Jed McCaleb, Vast is headquartered in Long Beach, CA, in a 165,000-square-foot facility, with a second 25,000-square-foot one in Hawthorne, and a test site at Mojave. Its first station, the Haven-1, targeted to launch in 2025, is “home to a state-of-the-art, human-centric innovation laboratory for both private astronauts and government missions”, conceived to be the world’s first commercial space station. Its second station, the Haven-2, is its proposal designed to succeed the International Space Station, which is set to be retired in 2030 by NASA. You know… easy stuff. Recently Vast introduced a new identity designed by San Francisco, CA-based <a href="https://manualcreative.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Manual</a>.</p>

<blockquote>Drawing inspiration from the modernist design ethos of 1970s NASA, we combined the precision of engineering with a softer, warmer, humanist sensibility—a reflection of Vast’s human-centered approach to space station interior design. This thoughtful balance enables Vast to communicate its mission with clarity and impact: to pioneer a new frontier of physical space, in space.</blockquote><h3><a href="https://manualcreative.com/work/vast" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Manual project page</a></h3>

<p>We are all thinking it, so let&#8217;s just address it upfront: both old and new logos are unequivocally similar <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/s75-31690.jpeg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to NASA&#8217;s worm logo</a> with the crossbar-less “A” and the straight-horizontals “S”. I had to ask Manual about this because I knew it would be a point of contention (and/or distraction) in the comments. Basically, it boils down to the old logo being well-liked by Vast and a desire to keep it so the best design response to that was to redraw it as nicely as possible. Mission accomplished. The new, wider proportions look great and make it look more customized and less generic than before — it would also make for a killer car logo. The tighter spacing now better highlights the interplay of the “V” and the “A”. The “S” is now properly balanced too, with its curves <em>not</em> shooting so far out as before. Long way of saying: nice evolution. The icon remains in play as a secondary element and looks pretty hip when accompanied by the sans serif typography in a full justified setting.</p>

<blockquote>Departing from the traditional category tropes of blues and blacks, Vast embraces a warmer, muted palette inspired by the natural tones of Haven-1’s interior design. This palette reflects the mission of creating a more human-centered space experience. Neutral tones are accented with a vibrant hot orange-red, adding warmth and energy while punctuating the visual identity with vibrancy.</blockquote><h3>Manual provided text</h3>

Rooted in the Helvetica-era international style, the typeface exudes a warmth and character that resonates with a human-centered space company. Its design origins in Los Angeles also align with Vast’s location, adding a subtle local connection.<br /><br />Balancing this warmth is Phonic Mono, a distinctive monospace typeface characterized by engineered, technical precision.<br /><br />Additionally, we developed a custom set of bold, futuristic numerals inspired by the Vast wordmark for prominent applications.<br /><br />Typography is anchored by formations of linear crosshairs, defining rectangular grids. These crosshairs reference the &#8216;fiducial markers&#8217; from NASA&#8217;s 1960s lunar photography, integrating a historical nod to space exploration.</blockquote><h3>Manual provided text</h3>

<p>The icon set is lovely with its thin lines and impressive abstraction of rocket-ship related topics. Like… fourth row, second column… the pod landing in the ocean with the parachutes? Are you kidding me? That&#8217;s perfection. The same simplicity is applied to slightly more detailed drawings of the stations&#8217; functionality and they are also superb.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s a difficult task to illustrate humans in a space station that looks like a Dieter Rams catalog so things get a little uncanny in the video above with the weird eye and head rotations but it does look and feel like the future.</p>

<blockquote>In collaboration with Gerard Mallandrich, we developed a motion package that transitions seamlessly between precision and impact. Dimensional motion, incorporating rotational axes, emphasizes Vast’s long-term mission of artificial gravity through centrifugal force and Haven-1’s low Earth orbit dynamics.</blockquote><h3>Manual provided text</h3>

<p>The motion is slick if perhaps a little too complicated at times? Or maybe there is one too many behaviors? I don&#8217;t think this is a complaint as I like all of the variations. I do have one strong complaint though: There is not enough of the abstract light particle animations. Those are amazing. I want 30 minutes worth of it.</p>

<p>The applications all look great, thanks to the refined typography deployment. When only Phonic is used in tandem with the logo, it looks particularly good. The use of crosshairs is nicely restrained and provides a solid recurring framing device from print to digital to wayfinding.</p>
