It&#8217;s geared more towards the advertising industry but still some good knowledge in there. To this day, I still remember (with dread) the first time someone told me at work “I will send you the <em>specs</em>” and I had absolutely no idea what <em>specs</em> were.

                                            <p><strong>Relevant quote</strong><br /><em>While many pharma businesses primarily communicate around the treatment of diseases, Boehringer aims to put a more optimistic brand feel forward, focusing on health and well-being. A positive emotion that is deeply anchored in the new brand core: Unvawering optimism.<br /><br />While the logo was the one element that needed to remain, Boehringer’s new brand identity represents an evolution of the entire business, ranging from a new color palette, that is unique to the industry, to illustration, typography, photography, layout, icons motion, a dedicated brand hub, a new website, social media, internal learning offerings and e-bites, and merchandise. Even further, Boehringer is one of only a few pharma businesses that now also has a unique sound branding.<br /><br />Across all of these digital and physical brand elements, inclusivity and color-blind safeness played a central role, allowing barrier free experiences by design.

                                            <p><strong>Opinion</strong><br />
                                            Building a new corporate identity without touching the logo and still being able to signal change is a very difficult task both to execute for designers and clients and, selfishly, for me to write about (as well as for you to think about). In this case we have the benefit of some samples of the old identity that paint a rather sad picture of how Boehringer Ingelheim was appearing in the world, in a drab blue and gray color palette with a disjointed set of assets, imagery, and illustration. The biggest change in the identity is the shift from blue to green in the color spectrum and it's an instant improvement, moving the company away from a heavily corporate patina to something more lively and energetic, even if slightly confusing in that it stops looking altogether like a Big Pharma company but that's not entirely a bad thing.<span></span> A lot of work went into building a comprehensive set of assets and at the forefront, and most successfully, is a new type family with a lot of flexibility that can cover all ranges of communication, from headlines to body copy and it has a friendly yet corporate and precise presence that looks good across all of its variations. The accent colors to complement the greens are quite nice and the photography is solid. The one misstep is the illustration, which serves as a reminder of why the Corporate Memphis style has become so tiring, with its awkward limbs, dead-inside facial expressions, and the unfinished kind of minimalism. The little motion they have doesn't help their cause and the single-color variations look even more unfinished.<span></span> Overall, the applications are well executed and there is definitely a strong flexibility to the system but between the feel-good scenes depicted in the illustration and photography, the green color palette, and the ambiguous copywriting, it's hard to tell, unless you are familiar with it, what Boehringer Ingelheim does. Merch is cool though — that green hoodie with the icon embroidered on green and what appears to be an illustrated liner on the hood deserves a pat on the back.</p>

Founded by three former Google employees and staffed with key recruits from Apple, Nest, and Tesla, the product is a response to HVAC (heating, ventilation, and air conditioning) systems being responsible for 70% of all fossil fuel used in the home, making homes accountable for 20% of greenhouse gas emissions in the United Sates. Consisting of three physical elements — a digital dial, an indoor unit, and an outdoor unit — Quilt works like traditional mini-split systems but is infinitely more stylish (and advanced), designed to seamlessly blend into any home. A mobile app completes the ecosystem that offers room-by-room control, advanced sensors to prevent energy waste in empty rooms, and personal energy data reports. To coincide with the product&#8217;s official launch earlier this year, Quilt introduced a new identity designed by San Francisco, CA-based <a href="https://manualcreative.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Manual</a>.</p>

<p>The old logo was a pretty good start and a solid foundation to work from with its chiseled sans serif. The icon had a good idea behind it as an abstract sewn quilt that could have also even been interpreted as different rooms in a home and it matched the hard angles of the wordmark nicely. The new logo abandons the icon and updates the wordmark to something more customized, fixing a couple of minor details from the old wordmark, mainly the previously oversized tittle and the stark difference in the wideness of the “Q” with the narrowness of the rest of the letters. Now, all of the characters feel more cohesive in width and height and improved spacing. I&#8217;m not so convinced by the new “Q” as I don&#8217;t think the opening adds much of value and the sharp-ish curve as the “Q” turns into its tail introduces a gesture that is very different from everything else going on in the characters. Nonetheless, it&#8217;s a strong, elegant, and contemporary logo.</p>

<blockquote>The qualities of the logo are reflected in Quilt Serif, a typeface based on <a href="https://typekiosk.smuss.studio/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">STK Bureau</a> but with refined numerals. The typeface imparts an editorial feel to the brand and creates a cohesive experience across brand, physical, and digital touchpoints when used in the Quilt user interface and app.</blockquote><h3><a href="https://manualcreative.com/work/quilt" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Manual project page</a></h3>

<figcaption>Identity overview.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>There is quite a lot to like in the identity elements, starting with the very slick (and slightly obscure) choice of <a href="https://typekiosk.smuss.studio/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">STK Bureau</a> that sidesteps most recent typographic choice trends and is a beautiful and sturdy serif that serves as both a strong contrast and a seamless complement to the logo. I&#8217;m not sure what the original numerals looked like but whatever they did on the customization resulted in some stunning numerals. The isometric illustrations and diagrams are super smooth and so polished with just the right balance of detail and abstraction (and playfulness) in the various home scenes depicted while also being clear and concise in explaining the functionality of the system. The photography, as is usually the case in Manual projects, is great and conveys a sense of comfort while not hiding the fact that this is a high-end, expensive system for an upscale consumer but without it being obnoxious.</p>

<blockquote>Our challenge was to visualize the qualities of Quilt, particularly the gentle flow of warm and cool air.<br /><br />To visualize the invisible airflow, we leveraged typography, technology, and motion. Collaborating with creative technologist <a href="https://www.instagram.com/kiel.d.m/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kiel Danger Mutschelknaus</a>, creator of Space Type Generator, we developed a generative type tool using Processing. This tool allows typography to mimic the subtle flow of air, creating a ‘quilt’ of air enveloping a space.<br /><br />The Quilt type generator enables typography to adopt waveforms and create 2D animations that pulsate, radiate, and swipe, reflecting the intelligent sensing technology that allows for room-by-room climate control.</blockquote><h3><a href="https://manualcreative.com/work/quilt" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Manual project page</a></h3>

<p>Adding some flex to the identity is a generator tool that can make typography flow in a zero-gravity-like environment and I could look at any of those for extended periods time while cool air blows in my face through one of their indoor units. While undeniably cool, the resulting patterns and deadpan-ness of the sans serif typography feel slightly at odds with the rest of the warmer and less trendy visual language. Something about the extra wide spacing and thinness of the sans serif feels off. Still, the patterns are put to nice use on the website&#8217;s header and footer so you can ignore any complaints I may have.</p>

<p class="end">Only a handful of applications to look at but everything is very nicely executed and well integrated. Perhaps the one odd thing is the gradient in the left-hand poster as it&#8217;s the only static gradient anywhere and it takes away from the sharpness of the other applications. I should go back and delete my complaint about the type patterns looking out of place because they look fire on the box and van (but I&#8217;m not gonna ’cause I wanted to stick to my original impression). Overall, this is a sophisticated yet not stuffy identity that establishes Quilt as a premium yet relatively attainable luxury, all with a strong sense of being a design-led product and system from start to finish.</p>

Our mission is to bring cutting edge endovascular intervention to everyone around the world, as quickly and as safely as possible. We are building the world’s first remotely operated endovascular robot to enable specialists to treat all patients immediately regardless of their location. Cardiovascular emergencies are uniquely time sensitive. Tragically, most patients wait hours to get to a specialist center for treatment. We believe no one in the world should suffer an inferior outcome because of where they live. Our goal is to treat all patients as quickly and as safely as possible, starting with stroke.&#8221;</p>

                                            <p><strong>Relevant quote</strong><br /><em>The brand needed to signal radical technological disruption and a humanistic vision. It would need to set them apart from the bland status quo for medical device companies. Help them attract the best minds across machine learning, medicine, and robotics. All while earning the trust of the medical industry, doctors, and future patients.<br /><br />The Remedy Robotics logomark is made of two parts. The first is an angled upper section pointing forward, a nod to Remedy’s future-looking approach. The arched lower section suggests the cross-section of an artery. Together they create a legible letter and shape, as well as a person stepping toward progress. When viewed from the side, the logo resembles two lowercase r’s for...you get one guess.<br /><br />If you look at satellite photos of rivers and other waterways, you’ll notice how closely they echo the appearance of the human endovascular system. We used this striking imagery as a visual metaphor for Remedy’s mission of bringing life-changing care to anyone, anywhere in the world.

                                            <p><strong>Opinion</strong><br />
                                            While the company has been around for four years, it appears they didn't have an official logo previously, with old versions of their home page on the Wayback Machine showing their name in the website's default typeface, so basically starting from scratch here. The icon-slash-monogram is eye-catching and bold, looking at first glance like an abstract uppercase “R” but also like abstract mechanical parts of a robot arm. I would have never guessed or interpreted the intended meanings of the upper piece representing the company's “future-looking approach” and the lower piece a “cross-section of an artery”. It's a stretch and a bit eye-roll-y but it doesn't take away from its strong graphic presence. The wordmark is okay and has a techie sheen to it that is appropriate. I would have tried making the default lock-up by stacking the two words not only to make the logo more compact as a unit but to play on the idea that the two pieces in the icon resemble lowercase “r”s on their side, so you would have one abstract “r” aligned with each of the initial “R”s.<span></span> The identity has some nice elements, particularly the serif, <a href="https://hottype.co/fonts/punta" target="_blank">Punta</a> by Hot Type, which looks great in headlines on the website in contrast to all the small sans serif (ECAL's <a href="https://ecal-typefaces.ch/typeface/concern/" target="_blank">Concern</a>) and thin-line icons. The satellite photos of rivers and waterways as metaphors for arteries and vessels is interesting and I appreciate the double meaning that Remedy Robotic's work extends beyond geographic constraints and be done in faraway places, like rivers extending across cities and countries but when used literally, things can get a little confusing as to why exactly those are there and when used more abstractly as just strands of white on black they look more like upside-down lightning bolts. Perhaps there was a mid-point between these two representations that still honored the concept but that also yielded something more specific to the endovascular system. Not a whole lot of applications but I would love to see more of the icon set in play as the main graphic elements because those are pretty cool and perhaps even more relevant in their loopy-connected designs than the rivers. Overall, this has a slightly sci-fi-ish vibe that captures the advanced technology and possibilities of surgical robotics while while its polished and sophisticated look exudes a sense of calmness and precision to give doctors and patients a sense of confidence and trust in a robot.</p>

<p>The name &#8211; literally &#8220;long live&#8221; or the feminine singular of &#8220;alive&#8221; in Spanish &#8211; is perfect for a wellness app, but it&#8217;s such a basic term with so much established cultural cachet behind it that I&#8217;m kind of amazed a new company chose to use it. I&#8217;m no trademark lawyer, but it seems like one of those words too generic for any one company to hold a claim &#8211; akin to Dove (chocolate/soap), Delta (airlines/dental), or Domino (pizza/sugar). It obviously made it through legal clearance, but they weren&#8217;t able to secure the viva.com URL and instead went with the slightly clunkier soyviva.com. Long gone are the AOL keyword days of internet branding where having a completely literal company-dot-com was of supreme importance, but it&#8217;s still a noticeable concession that a more distinctive name might not have necessitated. Those concessions followed them to the modern corners of the internet as well. On Instagram a cat account in China beat them to <em>@viva</em> and a vegan baker in Chicago got their backup with <em>@soy_viva</em>, leaving them with the more descriptive <em><a href="https://www.instagram.com/viva.bienestar" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@viva.bienestar</a></em> which matches neither their name nor their website.</p>

<p>But perhaps the most problematic element of the name of this app is that it&#8217;s far from the first Viva you see on the major app stores. Before you get to our Viva in the Google or Apple shops, you&#8217;ll have to sift through VPN services, Italian airlines, virtual slot machines, hotel reward programs, Microsoft forum tools, chicken restaurants, even other fitness and wellness apps who have all planted their flag in this particular four-letter name. These are small issues that stop existing once the user has the app installed and can be manually redirected to the website or social accounts, but they&#8217;re all very easily avoidable branding pitfalls that Viva dug for themselves.</p>

<p>The wordmark itself is much less generic. It&#8217;s nice to see a new script logo in this day and age where companies are trending away from them out of fear that the youth can&#8217;t read it. The cursive construction also allows for a very pleasing flow, with the “VIV” ligature especially nice with its vertical zig-zag motion. The angles of the “V”s and “I” allow the whole word to maintain great legibility, which can be an issue for short script names with a lot of neighboring ups and downs. A recent counter-example being last year&#8217;s <a href="https://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/new_logo_and_identity_for_marin_living_foods_by_the_working_assembly.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Marin Living Foods</a> rebrand, which gave us a comment section full of “M”s mistaken for “N”s. The only sticking point for me is the tail of the “A”. It maybe could have followed the curve a bit better in order to end the wordmark on a smoother curl, and it definitely could have maintained a consistent line weight with the rest of the letter that it&#8217;s in. I can&#8217;t tell if that&#8217;s a poorly executed optical balance hack or a mistake, but either way that “A” gets a C-.</p>

<p>The primary type for the brand is <a href="https://www.swisstypefaces.com/fonts/euclid/#Circular%20B" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Euclid Circular B</a> by <a href="https://www.swisstypefaces.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Swiss Typefaces</a>. In an identity where the logo and identity elements are so bouncy and colorful, having a more grounded and serious geometric font like this serves as a nice contrast. It&#8217;s very healthcare-coded, with the sort of friendly yet authoritative look that you&#8217;d want to see in a doctor&#8217;s office.</p>

<figcaption>Illustrations.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Corporate Memphis is one of those styles that has been over-saturated to the point of exhaustion, and it&#8217;s also garnered an ethically dubious reputation for flattening the joy and exuberance of the 1990s Memphis movement to give faceless corporations a false friendliness. It&#8217;s also an artstyle that relies on simple colors and geometry, which can read as low-effort. This may be the opinion where I lose all credibility as a brand reviewer, but this set of Corporate Memphis illustrations is really speaking to me.</p>

<p>The hallmarks of simple geometry and bold colors are still there, but there&#8217;s a thoughtfulness in the composition that instantly elevate them above almost every other execution of the style that I&#8217;ve seen. I like the palette being used, with a mid-century range of purples, oranges, and greens that dial in their intensity mainly through saturation. I like how, despite the base illustrations lacking outlines, thick lines are used for internal detail to represent text or the panels of an umbrella. I like the grainy shading that is used as literal lighting on physical objects like apples, but gets more colorful and expressive on abstract concepts like speech bubbles. There are some useless confetti elements &#8211; shapes like four-pointed sparks or outlined rectangles which don&#8217;t serve any purpose beyond adding slight visual complexity to the composition they&#8217;re sprinkled over. But they&#8217;re used sparingly and thoughtfully. I&#8217;m generally not much of a fan of this style, but I can certainly say that I&#8217;m a fan of this execution.</p>

<p>The illustrations are even better in motion. It&#8217;s mostly simple and intuitive behaviors &#8211; eyes open and close, hearts beat, etc. But the representation of emotions are especially good. One of my core critiques of Corporate Memphis is how humans are often represented with extremely simplified faces, or sometimes without faces at all. Well, here&#8217;s where all those faces went. Getting the emotional expression right in a product that addresses mental health is so important, and they&#8217;ve managed to capture such a broad spectrum of feelings within the bounds of the highly restrictive style they&#8217;ve chosen. The faces on their own would have sold it for me, but the addition of themed background shapes pushes it over the top. Even within the same shape category, the shear nuance between the jagged wobbly burst representing Enojada (Angry) and the stretched stuttering burst representing Ansiosa (Anxious) is superb.</p>

<figcaption>Generated backgrounds.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Brand asset generators are rad and we need more of them in the world. I love bespoke tools that can be used to make new things within an identity system. It&#8217;s like if a brand standards manual was a video game and my brain has been so thoroughly broken by graphic design that I love that kind of thing. And in this case, I can even appreciate what they&#8217;re going for on a thematic level. The fully abstract big bold colorful shapes are the core of the Memphis look and the ones shown above compliment the more modern interpretation seen throughout the rest of the identity.</p>

<p>All that said, wow these are samey. Part of the problem is that while the shapes change between layouts, the shape types and positions seemingly can&#8217;t. There&#8217;s always a top-left squiggle, bottom-left blob, right-side blob. And the squiggles and blobs are obviously pulling from established pools, leading to a good deal of noticeable repetition even if the combined layouts are technically unique. This feels like something that was done out of obligation rather than a desire to convey style or substance, purely to avoid the accident of showing the same background on two different screens. But every background is already barely distinguishable, so the whole practice feels pointless.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s <em>fine</em>. It <em>works</em>. The backgrounds it&#8217;s generating seem to only exist on their own on the audio tracks anyway, meaning for the most part the phone screen won&#8217;t even be turned on while they&#8217;re in use. But it could have been so much more interesting. We&#8217;ve seen so many cool generators lately, and unfortunately this is one of the weaker ones in an otherwise pretty strong visual identity.</p>

<p>Very Triste (Sad) that we don&#8217;t get to see those emotion animations in situ, but what we do see harmonizes well in the completed layouts. Though, unsurprisingly, it feels like priority has been given to the mobile version. The subtle animations and full-width focus that each section is allowed on a phone screen make each course feel properly emphasized in a way that&#8217;s somewhat lost on the two- and three-column layouts on desktop.</p>

<p class="end">In a highly illustration-driven identity, ILLO did a fantastic job of elevating a famously polarizing aesthetic to create a holistic system that encapsulates so many different aspects of health imagery. Granted, it&#8217;s still undeniably Corporate Memphis at its core, and for some people that&#8217;s going to be an immediate turn-off. But I really do think that this project has given the style a new lease on life.</p>
