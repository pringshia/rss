Our professional and dedicated coaches create a space for kids to relax, make new pals and be their authentic happy young selves. With exciting sports, games and activities, we feed each child’s curiosity, nurture their passions and inspire them to find what they love. It’s about showing the way to play and helping kids to get the best start in life.  Football, rugby, tennis. Holiday camps and parties. After-school and out-of-school. Where there’s an opportunity for our expert coaches to engage, excite and teach in the community, we want everyone joining in.&#8221;</p>

                                            <p><strong>Relevant quote</strong><br /><em>Our brand idea is born out of the belief that play isn’t just important for a child’s development, it’s vital. More than just fun, the ability to play and learn new skills can help social skills, develop confidence and encourage physical and mental well-being. The idea also leans into sporting vernacular and the language of coaching which enables easy internal buy-in, and can also resonate with kids of all ages. It’s a promise of quality and trust that communicates their expertise which is key for parents and the B2B audiences.<br /><br />Due to the amount of kit produced by The Foxes Club, and the need to be highly visible in all the locations their sessions take place, developing an iconic logo was always going to be key. We took inspiration from the crests and shields of sports teams and added a Foxes twist. The new logo informs a simple but dynamic visual language that has the flexibility to be adapted for Foxes FC.<br /><br />A key requirement of the new identity was that it needed to appeal to kids of all ages; cute enough for toddlers (and their parents) but cool enough for teens. For the older kids we used more confident imagery and the darker colours of the brand palette, as well as adding more attitude into the messaging which is all set in upper-case. For the younger kids, we used the lighter and brighter colours within the palette, pairing this with fun, playful imagery and messaging set using more of the quirky lower-case.

                                            <p><strong>Opinion</strong><br />
                                            Needless to say, the old logo wasn't great with the fox looking a little… thirsty, with its tongue sticking out and eyes wide open, plus it was hard to tell what exactly was going on in the illustration between the fox's head, its oversize tail, and the fact that it's wearing a t-shirt. It also leaned heavily toddler-ish. The new logo is a great evolution that does so much more with so much less, abstracting the fox to its bare minimum and without the aid of the iconic tail. I mean, it helps that it literally says “foxes” right on its face as otherwise it might be hard to decipher without it but, since this is a unit of image and name, it works perfectly and the intended depiction of a fox will seldom be confused. Shortening the name is beneficial not just in being able to fit it neatly in the face but also moving away from being perceived as an organization just for little kids. The wordmark, in <a href="https://www.myfonts.com/collections/tt-trailers-font-typetype" target="_blank">TT Trailers</a>, works really well in its condensed and quirky structure — I would have personally modified the “B” because it's needlessly distracting.<span></span> The new logo approach also replaces the old Foxes FC, which had a very different vibe from the primary logo so the two new logos now work seamlessly together to indicate they are part of the same team (no pun intended), which apparently was a big hurdle and issue previously. For the identity, TT Trailers also serves as the primary typeface and depending on how you feel about those “B”s and “R”s you will either love or hate the choice. The color palette is lovely, energetic, and very un-trendy, with a fox-orange color paired with a deep brown and accented with a very fun green. The illustrations, also bordering on Corporate Memphis <a href="https://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/new_logo_and_identity_for_jaffa_fruit_by_earthling_studio.php" target="_blank">like today's Jaffa illustrations</a>, are actually quite nice (if you are able to forget about all the more generic and lazier versions of the style that have come before it) and the motion is very charming.<span></span> The silhouette of the icon is scaled really big to create some fun lightning-bolt-slash-fox-fur graphic devices that look great on the brochures and advertising samples to frame and divide imagery and messaging as well as being cool design elements for the kits. Passing almost unnoticed in the merch image is a vest with a fox tail drawn on the back and it's so good. Overall, this does the very difficult job of being a kid- and teen-friendly brand that doesn't come across as adults trying (and failing) to connect with them by being overly childish or TikTok-ish for each of the two age ranges and it does so with energy and sophistication.</p>

                                            <p>Established in 2019 — I think — <a href="https://jaffa.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jaffa Fruit</a> is a provider of citrus, grapes, melon, and pineapples and the leading citrus brand in the UK, available throughout Tesco stores nationwide. Their flagship product is the eponymous <a href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaffa_orange" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jaffa orange</a>, a product originally from Israel but exported and sold worldwide by the Citrus Marketing Board of Israel which controls all production and marketing of fresh citrus fruits grown in Israel and marketed under the brand name Jaffa. In the UK, <a href="https://www.thejc.com/news/the-jaffa-oranges-grown-in-spain-adfxgfsg#:~:text=But%20a%20JC%20investigation%20has,fruit%20is%20out%20of%20season." target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tesco licenses the brand name from the Marketing Board</a> and despite Jaffa oranges not being grown year-round in Israel, Tesco can source oranges from other regions and sell them under the Jaffa name. I am not exactly sure how Jaffa Fruit in the UK came to be or how it&#8217;s tied to Tesco — there is not a whole lot of information out there — or how it&#8217;s able to sell other fruits under the same legally protected brand name. Anyway, recently Jaffa introduced a new identity designed by London, UK-based <a href="https://studioearthling.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Earthling Studio</a>.</p>

<blockquote>The rebrand represents a significant milestone in the company&#8217;s storied history. The new identity delivers moments
of zesty joy, highlighting the freshness, quality, and natural goodness of Jaffa produce, whilst creating exceptional

consumers while honouring Jaffa’s rich heritage, reputation for excellence and commitment to innovation and
sustainability.<br /><br />Jaffa has always been about delivering quality and everyday joyful moments and the current logo didn’t feel like it
aligned with this. Earthling studio decided to delve into the brands rich heritage to unearth a timeless, simple and
playful expression. The new logo reimagined is now dripping with humanity and provides greater standout on the
shelves and in digital applications.</blockquote><h3>Earthling Studio provided text</h3>

<p>One of the reasons I brought up the Jaffa brand name for the oranges is that the Jaffa Fruit logo is the same logo used by The Citrus Marketing Board of Israel so when I did a Google Image search for Jaffa products, the old logo AND <a href="http://birds.songs.free.fr/jaffacitrus.html#redpomelo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a variation of the new logo appeared throughout</a>. The latter is also used by <a href="https://orrijaffa.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Orri Jaffa</a>, a distributor and licensor of the name, making all of this a little bit confusing… especially at 5:30 am when I am researching and writing this but let&#8217;s get to what we have in front of us.</p>

<p>The old logo wasn&#8217;t particularly great or well executed but it had the right idea of employing a relatively quirky typeface with those thick terminals. The new logo takes the other logo variation pointed out above that exists somewhere in time and geography and that is alluded to in the design description where Earthling “delve[d] into the brands rich heritage to unearth a timeless, simple and playful expression” so while it&#8217;s not an original concoction or reinterpretation of the before logo, the execution is pretty flawless. The letterforms are thick and juicy and I love the very subtle curves in the terminals. It&#8217;s also pretty impressive how much bounciness the logo achieves by offsetting just a single letter as the “f” dips under the baseline. The oval shape is also a subtle improvement, with the ends being less pointy for a more organic shape. The biggest improvement, though, might be the color palette that brings the muted green, yellow, and blue combo into the twenty-first, digital-first century.</p>

<blockquote>A new family of fonts has been introduced to the Jaffa brand identity inspired by the fruit itself; juicy, rounded, bold
and playful. This new typography delivers an instant feeling of joy, which is further amplified when animated for use in
digital applications.</blockquote><h3>Earthling Studio provided text</h3>

<blockquote>Earthling Studio worked in close collaboration with Brooklyn based illustrator Spencer Gabor. A new cast of juicy characters have been created to interact with the product, with each depiction inspired by the unique product
attributes of the fruit. Executions range from an easy-riding Easy Peeler, a karate inspired Seedless Lemon slice of joy,
to Candy Floss Grapes as uplifting amusement park balloons.</blockquote><h3>Earthling Studio provided text</h3>

</figure>

<p>At the forefront of the identity are two very exuberant elements. First, there is the typography, <a href="https://www.myfonts.com/collections/choowee-font-vova-egoshin" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Choowee</a>, which I would probably scroll through instantly and dismiss it as way too quirky-slash-playful-slash-toddler-y but that is perfectly suited to match the energy and not steal the thunder of the second main element, the illustrations by <a href="https://spencergabor.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Spencer Gabor</a>. These border on Corporate Memphis but there is a sophistication to them that breaks away from the generic nature of the style and the big limbs serve a purpose as they interact with the fruits and other objects. The motion is excellent and adds a touch of extra whimsy to the already whimsical characters.</p>

<blockquote>The current brand colours (yellow, green and blue) have been dusted off, amped up and given a new lease of life, to
increase brand recognition and deliver a more contemporary expression. Earthling studio took the same approach to
the portfolio, allowing the colour for each variety to light up the fixture and bring a slice of joy to Tesco’s shelves.</blockquote><h3>Earthling Studio provided text</h3>

<p>The packaging follows the existing structural design for each of the different fruits and the new design can adapt well to any shape label, with the most challenging being the one attached to the citrus nets. The designs look particularly good when contrasted with the colorful fruits and the shifts in color palette are nicely modulated to stand out from the produce.</p>

Much better. Today, our flexible payments infrastructure helps leading software platforms — and their users — move money globally. And this is our story. We’re transforming payment experiences for software companies by making it easier to move money. For too long, payments between businesses have been slow and complex — lagging far behind those of the consumer world. Our view is that when two companies work together, everything has to move fast. By building products like invoice financing and flexible payment terms — and working with some of the leading tech companies around the world — we’re making this a real possibility.&#8221;</p>

                                            <p><strong>Relevant quote</strong><br /><em>We built the brand on the concept of showing the flow of digital money — fluid, seamless and high tech. The system’s basic building block is the electric green “Kinetic Square,” representing a single transaction, and morphing into fluid patterns that make the brand feel dynamic, even in static images. Aria’s logo is a direct descendant of the Kinetic Square, with the animated version referencing the more expressive Supergraphic device.<br /><br /> Directly connected to the broader visual language, the illustration style supports both the metaphorical to literal. It’s expressive, flexible and instantly recognisable. Aria’s primary typeface is F37 Lineca, a hard working, structured typeface that felt both suitably techy, and a good balance to the expressive illustration style. For no-nonsense body copy, we used the hyper-legible STK Bureau Sans. Aria’s palette takes its cue from the world of physical currency, adding a jolt of electricity for good measure.

                                            <p><strong>Opinion</strong><br />
                                            The old logo had a relatively interesting icon with a nice dimensional effect, possibly conveying the idea of the layered set of steps needed to complete a financial transaction online. It would have also been a great icon for a library as it looks like books. The wordmark was pretty bland and had no real relation or synergy with the icon. The new logo sticks with the abstract icon approach and this time, at first glance, looking like a set of dominoes, possibly conveying the idea of one action leading to a chain reaction to complete a financial transaction online. Its explanation that the icon is a “direct descendant of the Kinetic Square” is not as satisfying as a handful of other possible interpretations. Nonetheless, it's a nice icon and it's well paired with a cool wordmark that has some slick angular features that echo those in the icon.<span></span> The aforementioned “Kinetic Square” drives the identity and it's a fairly interesting graphic device that takes form in different ways, from oversized backgrounds, to patterns, to, most interestingly, illustrations. These are definitely the highlight of the project with their dimensional yet hollow construction as the loose tessellation patterns form different objects that look great both in motion and static. The iridescent color palette works well for the category of “money” and I like how the gradient-ish illustrations can work on both the rich green background or on white. The typeface, <a href="https://f37foundry.com/fonts/f37-lineca" target="_blank">F37 Lineca</a>, is a welcome choice from the more usual suspects and it has some fun features like the flat tops and bottoms in the counters of the rounded letters. The applications are all pretty decent and have a good range of expression. Overall, this has a bit of that ambiguity that comes with the financial transaction industry where companies have to look like banks and like software but also be techie and this identity manages it with some novelty in the illustrations and some slickness in the type and color choices.</p>

Located on the western side of the city&#8217;s central business district (for reference, it is a 15-minute drive from the Sidney Opera House), this area has been historically known as a mid-market waterfront destination. However the surrounding influx of high-end restaurants, bars, and hotels prompted King Street Wharf to reposition itself within this new market. Sydney-based <a href="https://theoffices.com.au/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Offices</a> worked with advertising and marketing agency <a href="https://alanplace.com.au/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alan Place</a> to create a new visual identity.</p><span id="more-298093"></span>

<blockquote>
For King Street Wharf, remaining competitive means repositioning as a more sophisticated destination to attract more high-end tenants, while still appealing to its core customer-base. It was a brief that called for some nuance and a light touch.
<br /><br />
We started by immersing ourselves in the wharf’s role as a working wharf, from the early 20th century to the present day. Cruise ships, ferries and leisure craft can be seen docking at the wharf year-round, from early in the morning until late at night. This characteristic serves as a major point of difference from other venues along the harbour.
<br /><br />
It also served as the creative springboard for the final visual identity. The identity system’s logo, colours and supporting graphics all build on the idea of a busy wharf, and were selected by the client in preference over a purely leisure-oriented brand and other creative options we initially presented.

<p>The former logo likely worked when King Street Wharf opened commercially in 2001, but times have changed and many of the design elements show their age. The thick/thin combo is no longer viable in digital applications. The small &#8220;ST.&#8221; feels unplanned and awkward. And, the fork/crown combo that signaled the area as a dining destination now feels limited with the current host of venues and activities (including two nightclubs and a bowling lane). Similarly, the social media posts feel flat in their straightforward text-over-image format and reveal the challenges when the logo was pulled from its container shape. New was needed.</p>

<blockquote>
We looked at a myriad of solutions. A customised anchor seemed well-worn but ticked many boxes for simplicity and recognition for the masses. We don’t mind the occasional obvious answer. Jay Z mentioned something about ‘dumbing down for your audience and doubling your money’.

<p>The new logo appears in a stacked full text version of &#8220;King Street Wharf&#8221; set in an all caps sans serif. The text is vertically stacked between a stylized anchor and &#8220;Sydney&#8221;. At first pass, this seems like a very straightforward and obvious answer. Yet, I really like it. The anchor has a stencil quality that pulls it away from more common iconography and hints at something that would be printed on the side of a shipping crate. The mirrored &#8220;K&#8221;s help fill in the shape and provide an otherwise lacking level of detail to the logo and the addition of the city name does emphasize the destination feeling.</p>

<p>The typography is <a href="https://rsms.me/inter/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Inter</a> by Rasmus Andersson. It is an open-source humanist sans serif that is one of the most used typefaces in the world. So, it is not necessarily exciting, but it is versitile, legible and familiar. The colors, highlighted by &#8220;Red King&#8221; provide a nice nautical palette with varying tones that feel good together.</p>

Stylised maritime flags, ropes and nautical accessories are offset by illustrated martini glasses, lemon wedges, prawns and other leisure symbols.

<p>The colors become a lot more interesting as they are applied across the illustrations. I love the range, because I can imagine that it would be easy to feel the need to pare this down to a tight set. Yet, we have flags, knots, lettering, and nautical cues all mixed together and it works. The resulting patterns create an interesting and harmonious backdrop. The feature illustrations, like the prawns are a nice second-level for features that complement the rest of the set and work as a counter to the nautical pull.</p>

<p>The website&#8217;s content is just what you would expect for a mixed-use destination, highlighting events, promotions, and locations. Yet, I do like the underlying structure and how the visual identity it applied. Everything is harmonious. The website and social media posts expand the identity with photography, and we start to see the full rhythm of the set: wireframe grid, logo in bottom right, and an inviting tone.</p>

<blockquote>
We didn’t want to feel forced. We looked at a simple way to juxtapose the variety of experiences at the KSW. Using repetition of the first letter was a sweet and memorable way to retain the message in punters’ heads. Outside of this messaging we stuck to a breezy, quippy, fun tone.

<p>Everything translates across the digital and static signage. The animated movements feel appropriate. One pet peeve is the use of the down arrow (as a directional device). It is an awkward way to say &#8220;look behind you&#8221;, and I always wonder how many people catch themselves looking at the ground. I think the only other thing that bothers me are the QR codes. (I mean, I get it. I just don&#8217;t like it.) For me, the oversized codes break from the casual tone established with the colors, copywriting, etc. and I want the signage to work well enough so I can wonder around the wharf holding someone&#8217;s hand, not navigating my device.</p>

<p>I am always a sucker for oversized numbers and illustrations, and I appreciate that continued use of the illustrations throughout. Often, it feels like they lack a clear home when design moves from ideation to application but here they hold a present and prominent role. The site boards help showcase the more playful side of the identity, but I feel it could be pushed further. However, the black background does put a bit of a damper on the overall. I imagine an alternate color could carry the load just as well but with a bit more cheer.</p>

<p>The wheatpaste postings are the least exciting part of the program for me. Here, the repeating pattern and alternating colors don&#8217;t do enough to highlight the individual performers.</p>

<p>The life ring bouy is a nice touch. And, I would absolutely wear that sweatshirt.</p>

<p class="end">Overall, this projects has all the hallmarks of a great identity: a core idea, a specific execution, and a pleasantly memorable application. This avoids the often-seen approaches of overly-corporate (which feel cold) or overly-hospitality-driven (which feel fake) identities that I see in mixed-use spaces. And, while I haven&#8217;t been to Sydney (and Armin didn&#8217;t approve my travel request), I feel like I would know when I found King Street Wharf and be able to use it as an anchor point in the city.</p>
