                                            <p>From humble beginnings in 2014 in Austin, TX, originally as “Must B Nutty”, offering almond flour-based tortillas, Siete, as it was renamed in 2015, was acquired earlier this month by PepsiCo for $1.2 billion. This would be a massive deal for any product but is especially significant for this small, family-owned, Mexican-American business that has grown to offer grain free tortillas, enchilada sauces, taco seasonings, botana sauces, mexican cookies, vegan beans, grain free puffs, and salsas available across 40,000 retailers. This begs the question: Had they remained with their original name and design would they have achieved the same success? (Of note: The name “Siete” refers to the seven siblings involved in the business and the heron, which translates to “garza” in Spanish is for Garza, the family&#8217;s last name.)

                                            <p>(Est. 2024) &#8220;In a world where the ordinary rules the day, there’s always room for a twist. We call it <a href="https://zigzaglife.in/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ZigZag</a>. It’s more than just vodka; it’s your passport to a life that’s vibrant, exciting, and undeniably yours. Imagine Tuesday afternoons or Saturday nights—where every moment sparkles with energy, laughter flows as easily as your favourite drink, and every sip feels like a mini celebration. That’s ZigZag. Here to offer you an experience that turns any occasion into something unforgettable. Because life is too short for dull moments. Whether you’re hosting a gathering or unwinding after a long day, ZigZag brings a burst of colour and fun to your life and your glass. The physical form of this philosophy? Pure chance, somehow, bottled. It’s a drink filtered four times (with carbon, silver, platinum, and gold) to remove impurities. It’s a drink that demands you use it for what it’s intended—having a great time off the beaten path. Clean. Crisp. Smooth. Vodka raised to another level.&#8221; ZigZag has been launched by the founders of <a href="https://simbabeer.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Simba</a>, one of India’s largest craft beer brands. </p>

                                            <p><strong>Relevant quote</strong><br /><em>ZIGZAG was conceptualized as an irreverent antithesis to both high-end Vodka brands (Absolut, Grey Goose, Ciroc...) and low-end brands (Magic Moments, White Mischief, Romanov). Sophisticated and design-forward to appeal to a new cohort of drinkers, but without the price and snob-value of imported brands.<br /><br />The ZIGZAG logo is designed to be bold, both on the packaging and off it - on coasters, bar signs, merchandise, everywhere. The two symmetrical parts of the name (ZIG / ZAG) fit perfectly within the horizontal strokes of the chunky Z holding shape, making the name stand out. The Z holding shape also stretches beautifully to create dynamic graphics for the visual language.<br /><br />The visual language is all sorts of lively, playful and loud, with an edgy personality that celebrates ‘never walking straight’. The packaging features a two part front label, leaving a window in between to peek inside the bottle. The inside of the back label features a groovy pattern that distorts in fun and unpredictable ways through the clear liquid, elevating the bottle to a design piece.

                                            <p><strong>Opinion</strong><br />
                                            I'm kind of surprised more things are not named Zig Zag… it's such a cool-sounding name and each word has three letters, including one of the coolest in the alphabet so it's fun to see this vodka take advantage of it in the best of ways. Using the monospace <a href="https://klim.co.nz/retail-fonts/pitch-sans/" target="_blank">Pitch Sans</a> as a starting point for some additional zigging and zagging in the letterforms, the name is then placed within a big, bold “Z” shape — itself zigging and zagging — resulting in a pretty cool, self-contained mark. It could arguably be one too many “Z”s but I think it all works perfectly together.<span></span> The packaging does not pull any punches either, literally backing up the logo with a crazy pattern that is amplified by the liquid inside and the curvature of the bottle. Placing the logo inside a square might defeat the purpose of having such a well self-contained mark but even that additional element works great to offset the metallic logo from the pattern with the colorful box helping to define the different flavors. The bottom element on the bottle, with the flavor of each version inside an elongated starburst is a fun complement to the logo. The “VODKA” typography is a little dry and a slightly off choice but it's not bad. The label around the neck of the bottle with the sawtooth-blade motif might be one zig-zag direction too many but, heck, it adds to the craziness of the bottle and that same graphic device repeats in the cases where it works rather nicely.<span></span> For social media, a script, <a href="https://typetype.org/fonts/tt-backwards/" target="_blank">TT Backwards Script</a>, is added into the mix, along with a bunch of jarring colors and it starts to feel like it's trying too hard to be fun, cool, and irreverent just for the sake of it. Overall, and to its credit, the whole vibe of this is about going overboard and clearly about having fun through an exuberant visual language that goes against most expected tropes in the spirit category, making the old and clichéd adage of zigging when others zag come to life.

<blockquote>Robinhood needed an identity that would resonate with a more mature audience of seasoned investors, signaling an evolution from scrappy disruptor to a financial platform of the future. We worked closely with the Robinhood in-house team to bring their vision to life through a brand language that is sharp, sophisticated, and built to scale.<br /><br />Our solution is rooted in a simple insight: when it comes to standing out in a sea of fintech sameness, less is more. This approach not only guided our refinement of individual brand elements, but inspired how we brought them together in a smart, modular system that could flex across their multiple finance products — from traditional stocks and crypto to their new premium subscription service, Robinhood Gold. We began by streamlining their iconic feather symbol to draw attention to the upward arrow within it, then polished the letterforms of the wordmark — resulting in a more intentional brand signature.</blockquote><h3><a href="https://portorocha.com/robinhood" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PORTO ROCHA project page</a></h3>

<blockquote>To celebrate that growth and to mark the beginning of a new chapter in Robinhood’s story, we’re excited to start rolling out an elevated new visual identity that better reflects who we are today and signals what’s in store for our future. <br /><br />“Robinhood’s new visual identity is an external representation of the growth and maturity of our business,” said Michael Goodbody, VP of Marketing at Robinhood. “Throughout the design process, we channeled the bold and disruptive spirit that defines Robinhood to create something completely different that elevates our brand and challenges the industry as a whole. The result is a modern and sophisticated look that is more accommodating, stretches across our growing suite of products, and positions us as the home for serious investors for generations to come.”</blockquote><h3><a href="https://newsroom.aboutrobinhood.com/a-new-visual-identity/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Robinhood blog post</a></h3>

<p>The logo evolution is half good and half bad. The good is the simplified feather icon that removes that small piece on the bottom right that didn&#8217;t quite add much to the icon and actually made it more confusing as it was unclear what purpose it served. The bad is the unnecessary alteration of the wordmark to now feature ink swells, making the type look unrefined and almost as if the vectors somehow got corrupted on their own. The transitions from stem to bowl in the “b”, “n”, “h”, and “d” are poorly handled and make the letters look deformed and frail… like, if you apply enough heat to it, those joints are going to finish melting and the bowls are going to come off the stems. It&#8217;s just such an odd evolution, especially when you see the rest of the identity that is literally sharper in every respect. Also, the feather icon has been returned to the left of the wordmark as it was back before the latest redesign in 2020. The logo “animation” leaves a lot to be desired for.</p>

<blockquote>Our color strategy departs from competitors’ rainbow approach, opting instead for a focused palette of black, white and mature neutrals that make room for pops of Robin Neon: a new electric yellow green unique to Robinhood.</blockquote><h3><a href="https://portorocha.com/robinhood" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PORTO ROCHA project page</a></h3>

<blockquote>The typographic system features a new sans serif, Robinhood Phonic. Where their previous sans lacked character, Phonic’s delicate ink-traps bring personality without sacrificing precision. This is balanced by headlines set in a warm yet intelligent serif, Martina Plantijn.</blockquote><h3><a href="https://portorocha.com/robinhood" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PORTO ROCHA project page</a></h3>

<p>For the core elements of the identity, the color palette focuses on a new bright green contrasted with black and supported by a range of warm grays, which is fine, and the typography introduces a custom sans serif (with curved ink traps) and the very nice serif <a href="https://klim.co.nz/retail-fonts/martina-plantijn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Martina Plantijn</a>, which is also a fine combination. Nothing out of the ordinary nor anything overly exciting.</p>

<blockquote>While the previous identity’s emphasis on futuristic illustrations worked for a singular product, it lacked the flexibility to speak to their expanded range of financial tools. We decided to pivot to a highly technical illustration style inspired by financial graphs familiar to investors. In contrast to the previous identity’s complex and richly detailed artwork, the new graphic language is easy to replicate and scale, allowing Robinhood to set an expert tone in touchpoints large and small across their diverse product suite.</blockquote><h3><a href="https://portorocha.com/robinhood" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PORTO ROCHA project page</a></h3>

<blockquote>Taking cues from lifestyle and luxury fashion, we introduced a photographic language that depicts singular subjects through a graphic and sophisticated lens — an unexpected move in the finance space. If in the past Robinhood existed in a zoomed-out, illustrated world of entire futuristic cities, the rebrand pushes them forward in the opposite direction: zooming in on real, individual subjects open to interpretation. In this new image world, a closeup of a double-yolked egg could speak to returns, or linked chains could allude to cryptocurrency. Renowned still-life photographer <a href="https://www.instagram.com/laurenbamford/?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lauren Bamford</a> brought this strategy to life through a suite of evergreen brand imagery.</blockquote><h3><a href="https://portorocha.com/robinhood" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PORTO ROCHA project page</a></h3>

<p>The supporting elements are where the Robinhood identity takes a drastic turn <a href="https://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/new_logo_and_identity_for_robinhood_by_collins.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">from what we last saw on Brand New in 2020</a>, when COLLINS introduced one of the most imitated illustration styles (as well as one of the most referenced by both me and some of the readers/commenters on Brand New as an example of great illustration use). Leaning 100% on a sci-fi visual narrative, the old identity felt completely original, unexpected, and exciting, even if it was slightly confusing as to why Robinhood would present itself this way — it didn&#8217;t matter, it was epic and the illustration library was actually both helpful in explaining some of the financial jargon and engaging  in drawing a broader audience to the platform.</p>

<p>All of that is now gone and in its place are some slick graphics and illustrations that are perfectly fine but also perfectly generic. They are not “bad” by any stretch of the imagination. In fact, in motion they are quite delightful and I will always appreciate a good 3D animation achieved with only flat graphics and even more commendable here that it&#8217;s only achieved with white strokes but in contrast with the exuberance of the previous identity, it&#8217;s simply not the same.</p>

<p>This is a feeling exacerbated by the new photography. It is, unquestionably, excellent photography and technically proficient in every possible way but it feels like such an antiquated way of representing a financial institution. <a href="https://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/new_logo_identity_and_campaign_for_lloyds_bank_by_wolff_olins_and_adameveddb.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Like Lloyds yesterday</a>, with its cheesy-on-purpose photography playing off of headlines, this feels like cheesy metaphors that are trying so hard to make fintech look like art. A shoe on a spring? Carabiners? Peas in a pod (as you will see further below)? A giant watering can and a baby watering can? It&#8217;s all just too <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=successory+posters&#038;sca_esv=d5db76981dc197ce&#038;udm=2&#038;biw=1509&#038;bih=1151&#038;sxsrf=ADLYWILKJ57aBsJ3gOuTWoKrsQnV6NOlAA%3A1729075178449&#038;ei=6pcPZ4-MG7mZ5OMPlpyLiQQ&#038;oq=Successory&#038;gs_lp=Egxnd3Mtd2l6LXNlcnAiClN1Y2Nlc3NvcnkqAggBMgoQABiABBhDGIoFMgUQABiABDIHEAAYgAQYGDIJEAAYgAQYGBgKMgcQABiABBgYMgkQABiABBgYGApI-BlQAFgAcAF4AJABAJgBAKABAKoBALgBAcgBAJgCAaACBZgDAIgGAZIHATGgBwA&#038;sclient=gws-wiz-serp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Successory-esque</a> and, in the resulting photo-as-Art-with-a-capital-A aesthetic, it ends up feeling exclusionary, as if you need to already be a finance bro to be able to use Robinhood.</p>

<p>The applications are all perfectly fine. The typography is well balanced, the color palette is well deployed, the stroke graphics look slick, and the photography is luscious but it all definitely feels too upscale and more like a wealth management platform. To their credit, the identity does fulfill the new intended direction as shared in <a href="https://newsroom.aboutrobinhood.com/a-new-visual-identity/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Robinhood&#8217;s blog post</a> — to give customers “a more streamlined, distraction-free experience that allows them to focus on making serious decisions about their future and finances” — so they are most certainly targeting an already affluent audience that is <em>serious</em> about finances.</p>

<p>For <a href="https://robinhood.com/us/en/gold/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Robinhood Gold</a>, a “subscription-based membership program of premium services”, the identity goes hard on gold everything. Gold type, gold objects, gold shines, gold gradients. Understandable, of course, but also a little too pretentious at times. I do like the use of the serif in these applications.</p>

<p class="end">Overall, this is clearly meant to be a drastic departure that shifts the tone and personality of Robinhood as a way to attract a more serious, affluent, and upscale audience that appreciates the finer things in life versus an adventurous audience that was previously being invited to explore the possibilities of investing and trading. Neither approach is more right or wrong than the other and Robinhood is free to attract whatever audience they choose but it&#8217;s, at least personally, sad to see such a unique illustrated identity being replaced by something so overly polished and expected in the category.</p>

                                            <p><strong>Relevant quote</strong><br /><em>Lloyds, the largest UK retail and commercial financial services provider, today launches its biggest-ever multi-channel campaign celebrating its refreshed and rebranded mobile banking app. The fully integrated campaign, created in partnership with creative agency adam&amp;eveDDB, global brand consultancy Wolff Olins and media agency Zenith, brings together more than 500 different assets across the app, campaign executions, activations and digital strategy spanning AV, audio, outdoor, social, digital, influencer and gaming channels.<br /><br />The launch campaign, created by adam&amp;eveDDB, marks the launch of Lloyds’ latest version of its customer app; the first activation and product to be designed under the refreshed brand, as part of its wider strategic ‘Lloyds moves everyone forward’ repositioning and expression.<br /><br />During Lloyds’ strategic brand review the Wolff Olins team found that while nearly everyone has a financial step forward to take, many people struggle to do so. This insight led to the formation of the brand’s new positioning: ‘Lloyds Moves Everyone Forward’ a lens for the brand experience and product innovation including the app. <br /><br />​​The team developed a design philosophy for the brand that feels distinctly Lloyds but has evolved for the digital era - supporting the overall customer experience. Wider brand identity changes include a reinvigorated colour palette with a new sense of ownership of the classic Lloyds green, an updated tone of voice that evokes a grounded sense of Britishness, and a new photography style holding a mirror to modern culture.

                                            <p><strong>Opinion</strong><br />
                                            The old logo was fine and could have stayed like that for another 15, 30 years without any issues, especially as it continued <a href="https://1000logos.net/lloyds-bank-logo/" target="_blank">the 130-plus-year tradition of the horse looking backwards</a> and, other than the awkward “A” in “BANK”, it had a nice, timeless wordmark. The new logo evolves the horse to face forward because, sure, it's more optimistic and which business or organization doesn't want to look to the future instead of the past? Its design has also been streamlined and made more dynamic with sharper angles, curvier curves, and more stylized shadows. All the tweaks, I think, are fairly beneficial and make for a stronger icon. The wordmark changes are subtler but now that “LLOYDS” is on its own without “BANK”, the new, elegant flares will be noticeable and help convey the long history of the bank.<span></span> The identity doubles down on the green hues, introducing some brighter shades to liven up the applications and it adopts <a href="https://www.grillitype.com/typeface/gt-ultra" target="_blank">GT Ultra</a>, in both its Median style (which has some flared serifs) and Standard style (for a bolder sans serif look), as the brand type family, which complements and supports the logo quite well. The horse also inspires some fun motion behaviors that make the type, imagery, and messaging gallop, canter, charge, and flick, which most people will probably not notice but it's a rather clever and relevant foundation to build on.<span></span> The applications shown are… okay. It's hard to tell what vibe they are going for… at times it feels too serious but at others it feels way too casual as it introduces illustrations and the messaging and campaign elements that use memes and user generated content feel like they are trying too hard to be young and hip but then there are also the photographic metaphors and copywriting that come across as a little antiquated, like 1980s print advertising. The TV spot is a little more engaging. Overall, it's certainly an attractive design evolution and the elements are flexible and engaging but in terms of messaging, tone of voice, and definition of who Lloyds is for, it feels like it's missing a clearer direction.</p>

                                            <p>Launched in 2014 (originally as “Green Sheep” before being renamed in 2016), <a href="https://drinkopenwater.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Open Water</a> is a brand of ultra-purified still and sparkling waters, packed in 100% recyclable aluminum bottles and cans — one of the first to pioneer the canned water category. Co-founded by Jess Page and Nicole Doucet, the duo began working on the product while undergrads at the University of Miami and pursued the business straight out of college as a direct response to the increasing dangers of plastic water bottles and ocean pollution. Available in mayor retailers like Whole Foods, Fred Meyer, and City Market, Open Water has taken a less traditional approach to entering the market through key partnerships that have led to being the official water company for The Oscars, Chipotle, and the new Intuit Dome NBA arena as well as being sold in zoos and aquariums. As the first water brand in the world to become Climate Neutral Certified it has eliminated over 100 million plastic bottles since its founding. Recently, Open Water introduced a new logo and packaging designed in-house — co-founder Jess is a designer and the company&#8217;s Chief Brand Officer — in collaboration with Göteborg, Sweden-based <a href="https://happy.fb.se/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">F&amp;B Happy</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
Since launching, we have eliminated more than 100 million plastic bottles, and the concern about plastic pollution has gone from niche to mainstream. 
<br /><br />
With this shift, we knew we needed to double down on what we believe in and better communicate why we are far from being a “normal” water brand. This is the stuff we care about:<br />
🌊 Eliminating plastic bottles<br />
🌊 Sourcing world-class water as locally as possible (that means not shipping water in from faraway pseudo-exotic sources like South Pacific islands or European mountaintops)<br />
🌊 Minimizing the amount of packaging we use and making it out of recycled and recyclable material whenever we can<br />
🌊 Giving money to clean ocean nonprofits, with every purchase amplifying our impact
<br /><br />
Our new packaging and messaging help make these values crystal clear. So with this refresh, Open Water is ready for the next 10 years and beyond.

<p>The old logo suffered from being able to have more impact and have more functionality as there was a lot of wasted space in the circle with the name of the brand not filling it up, which meant the circle had to be used bigger in order for the name to stand out. It also placed too much emphasis on “Open”, with “Water” being a secondary element and literally dividing the brand&#8217;s name. The script execution was also kind of uncomfortable as the connections had no flow and the lock-up with water was oddly spaced. The new logo corrects pretty much everything that was wrong and/or limiting about the old one.</p>

<p>The circle is gone, allowing the logo to live on its own and be used in any size. The two words are now equally important and better integrated through a much nicer script with proper flow and some very satisfying alignment of strokes, particularly the “t” as it connects with the “W” before it and the “n” above it, or the “p” lining up with the middle of the “W” or the stems of the “r” and “t”. The tight spacing and the way the letters contour around each other is quite pleasing too. If I had one negative criticism it would be the “p” that perhaps would have benefitted from an open bowl to have a more cursive-like structure. Still, a huge improvement that makes the product look livelier and more fun.</p>

<p>The identity introduces some really strong elements, starting with the headline typeface, <a href="https://ohnotype.co/fonts/softie" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ohno Softie</a>, which is all kinds of fun and approachable, giving Open Water a warmer, friendlier tone that doesn&#8217;t come across as preachy or damning. The monospace, <a href="https://finaltype.de/en/projects/monoflow" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Monoflow</a>, is also delightful and a welcome alternative to the colder and more technical monospaces we usually see. The one odd choice is Avenir as it looks too stiff and outdated in contrast to the much more contemporary and engaging choices. The wave graphics are a carryover from the previous design but they now feel more in sync with the rest of the elements that follow an organic aesthetic through some fun badges and spot illustrations, the latter done by the great <a href="https://www.instagram.com/mattblease/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Matt Blease</a>.</p>

<p>The old packaging was pretty decent but its ability to create brand awareness and recognition was far from perfect as the logo was barely noticeable but it did introduce the wave graphics that probably had a higher recognition factor. With the new logo, the labels are now far more impactful and there is much better synergy with the wave graphics and the addition of the typographic badges, all of which feels more integrated. The one questionable move might be the lower contrast on the product descriptor of “Still” vs. “Sparkling” where it appears twice on the cans but quite small. In the end, the packaging does have a very strong presence on the shelves or out in the world.</p>

<p class="end">The few other applications shown are fun too, with a bit of a collage-y approach as the various elements are cobbled together around some big headline typography and silhouetted versions of the product — an approach that is nicely carried over unto the website, designed by London, UK-based <a href="https://otherway.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Otherway</a>. Overall, a really strong evolution that makes Open Water look and feel more confident as well as more fun and comfortable in its own skin now that the canned-water category has hit its stride and become more embraced by the public, so it doesn&#8217;t have to fight so hard to convince people this is the right choice. Now, it&#8217;s the fun choice.</p>
