                                            <p><strong>Relevant quote</strong><br /><em>With new leadership at the helm, Hongkong Land was ready to propel its brand into the future, from traditional to unequivocally innovative. The new story surfaces their core strengths — excellence, innovation and exceptional hospitality. Captured in the line ‘experience is central’, it reflects the trust in Hongkong Land, elevated customer experience and the city core strategy, encompassing the Central district in Hong Kong that many will know and love today.<br /><br />Inspired by the ancient Chinese character 壽 meaning ‘longevity’, the H symbol crafted by famed graphic designer Henry Steiner has become a recognisable feature of the Hongkong Land brand. We retained the original intent of the historic symbol, updating the shape for a digital world and bringing it into three dimensions through motion.<br /><br />Rendered in new depth and dimension, the ‘H’ transforms into an immersive experience to step into. Through textures, overlays and perspective shifts, we created patterns reminiscent of the bridges and elevated walkways that Hongkong Land built. Paired with reportage-style photography, we bring a cinematic quality to the brand, placing you right at the core of the city centre experience.<br /><br />We’ve maintained a timeless and elegant approach to typography. Univers links the company to its history, while Noto resonates globally as a typeface made for over 1,000 languages. A classic neutral base is punctuated with accent colours to bring energy and modernity to the corporate brand.

                                            As a relevant sidebar: TIL about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Steiner" target="_blank">Henry Steiner</a>, an Austrian graphic designer working in Hong Kong, who designed the logo for HSBC — fantastic history about it <a href="https://history.hsbc.com/exhibitions/hsbc-and-the-hexagon" target="_blank">here</a> — among many others. Among those many others is Hongkong Land's “H” monogram that combined the Chinese character for “longevity” with a floor plan into a bold corporate mark. The logo is kept mostly intact with slight refinements to make all the vectors snap into a grid and even the old-school Univers wordmark stays along for the ride. Both elements than are reinvigorated through some more contemporary executions that elevate the corporate identity well beyond the generic look it had landed on recently.<span></span> Leading the identity is a series of patterns created from the various bits and pieces that make up the “H” but expanded into a series of perspective plane views that emulate directories you might find on large, multi-level commercial buildings and developments. The effect is at its best when the multiple planes are rendered in dotted and line grids, which yield some really nice textures when overlapped. The flat color versions are fine but not as interesting. Some of the applications have a bit of a 1960s throwback vibe with Univers doing what it does best — being neutral and corporate — especially in the trio of brochure covers with the black and white photography. Personally, I would love to see a little bit more of the bold weight of Univers used in the wordmark but that's just me.<span></span> The digital applications are fine but looking at the video above the “Various digital applications” caption, I feel like 10 years from now, some other design firm will use that as an example of “Samples of the old identity” to point out that there was a certain generic-ness and inconsistency to it. Overall, this is a relatively ambitious and “out-there” identity for what I am sure is a very reserved and conservative corporation so even this subtle amount of graphic expression seems like a bold statement to make but with everything being well thought-out and considered this feels just right for the company's B2B audience.</p>

<h1 class="friday_likes">Pava by Majo Prenassi, Santiago Brandani, and Norberto Batiz</h1>

<p style="margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;"><a href="https://www.instagram.com/paaaaaava/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pava</a> is a café outside the main area of Madrid, Spain, serving coffee, food, and good vibes. The identity, designed in collaboration by a trio of creatives —  <a href="https://www.behance.net/majoprenassi" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Majo Prenassi</a> (creative direction), <a href="https://www.behance.net/SantiagoBrandani" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Santiago Brandani</a> (design), and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/ober.77" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Norberto Batiz</a> (design) — revolves around two distinct but equally charming elements. The first is a delightfully clunky and angular wordmark encased in an oval, all in the same thickness and just the right amount of “blurpy” corners to give it some added quirkiness. I love how it&#8217;s a kind of industrial script and how there is no reason those connecting lines should work yet they do. On some f the dinnerware the wordmark appears without the oval and it looks probably even better on its own. The other element is a frog mascot, which is a nod to the café&#8217;s proximity to the the Manzanares river that flows nearby. The frog is very frog-like in terms of its anatomy but it exhibits some human traits like crossing its arms and chilling on a picnic blanket while pondering the meaning of life. The primary olive green color throughout is quite nice too. As a bonus, the exterior has some cool graffiti that you can see in either this <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@walkeatdie/video/7440839187844173089" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TikTok</a> or <a href="https://justbefoodie.com/pava-una-rana-que-conquisto-al-barrio-de-moscardo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this food review</a>, which even features a place to put <a href="https://justbefoodie.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/desayunos-cafe-especialidad-madrid-rio.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a candle offering for Saint Frog</a>. <span class="pagination_divider"></span><span class="small_caps"><a href="https://www.behance.net/gallery/214339793/Pava-Caf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">See full project</a></span></p>

<h1 class="friday_likes">Testarossa by de Vicq design</h1>
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/friday_likes_testarossa.jpg" alt="Testarossa by de Vicq design" />

<p style="margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;"><a href="https://www.instagram.com/testarossa.glenmills/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Testarossa</a>, part of the <a href="https://www.fearlessrestaurants.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fearless Restaurants</a> group, is a restaurant offering Italian American cuisine from a funky and unexpected Art Deco building in Glen Mills, PA. The identity, designed by San Francisco, CA-based <a href="https://www.devicq.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">de Vicq design</a>. takes a cue from the curvy exteriors of the building and, as de Vicq shares, takes inspiration from Italian actress Monica Vitti in her role as criminal-mastermind-turned-secret-agent in the 1966 film <em>Modesty Blaise</em>, which, if like me, you haven&#8217;t seen, can be summarized as “Charming and sexy”. This all translates into a lovely custom wordmark that forms the letters from independent, extra curvy segments and heart- and lip-shaped dingbats, all with a tight squeeze across the middle. Hard to describe, easy to appreciate. A standalone icon takes the same shapes to create a red-haired woman with pigtails as a nod to the name, which means redhead in Italian. The red, magenta, and purple color palette is a welcome change from the typical Italian American restaurant and further establishes a link with the building&#8217;s exterior as it lights up like a sunset at dusk. <span class="pagination_divider"></span><span class="small_caps"><a href="https://www.devicq.com/#/testarossa/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">See full project</a></span>

<h1 class="friday_likes">•KORTEN by Michelangelo Greco</h1>
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/friday_likes_korten.jpg" alt="•KORTEN by Michelangelo Greco" />

<p style="margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:30px!important;"><a href="https://www.instagram.com/korten.socialbar/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">•KORTEN</a> is a self-described “social bar” offering cocktails, oven-fired pizzas, and other good-looking dishes from Parco del Galateo in Lecce, Italy. The identity, designed by Bologna, Italy-based <a href="https://www.instagram.com/dudegraph" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Michelangelo Greco</a>, revolves around a wordmark that, to be honest, I am not sure I even like but that is deployed with enough confidence that I&#8217;m willing to allow myself to appreciate it. Looking like a slightly customized <a href="https://ortype.is/specimen/separat" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Separat</a>, I almost have a guttural negative reaction to that “R” but I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s the extra dot or the tweaked “K” that emphasizes that disconnected gesture of the “R” sort of make it work. I know for sure that the rusted metal sign with the stenciled version of the wordmark helps it be far more palatable, not to mention the burger on top the logo in the food liner. That helps too. <span class="pagination_divider"></span><span class="small_caps"><a href="https://www.behance.net/gallery/220130175/KORTEN-Branding" target="_blank" rel="noopener">See full project</a></span></p>

                                            <p><strong>Relevant quote</strong><br /><em>Few places have the power to perfect and maximize every little detail, but Megaplex is one of those places. Fueled by their meticulous and fanatical culture, we teamed up with the Megaplex team to put the mega back into Megaplex.<br /><br />We rebuilt Megaplex’s visual identity to hero any memory that can be made there, from the pupil-dilating movie screens to the beauty of a popcorn kernel. We created a visual identity that heightens the reality of Megaplex with scale, rich colors, eye-catching framing, and energetic repetition.<br /><br />The best example of this approach is in our logo, which nods to the shape and stretch of movie screens while nodding to the Megaplex M. Throughout the brand, those same contours frame, block, and showcase the variety of Megaplex experiences.<br /><br />In lock step with visuals, our verbal identity depicts the idea of Megaplex as something larger and richer than reality. Instead of explaining how much bigger and better things are, we use drama, colorful language, and metaphors to play with the senses and make things, like popcorn, feel more monumental.

                                            <p><strong>Opinion</strong><br />
                                            The old logo had a lot going on and none of it was particularly good. The default-looking typography was typeset in two extremes: super tight and extra super duper loose. Neither of which was pleasant. The original owner's signature, which was a nice signature, was the only decent element but probably a pain to reproduce at scale and with flexibility. The new logo is a drastic and welcome revolution that pretty much abandons everything it had before, which is actually kind of surprising as I imagine there was a lot of personal investment from the client in not entirely leaving behind the Larry H. Miller name and legacy but, at a time where movie theaters are on the brink of extinction, I think the shift to something more exciting and with broader appeal is the right move.<span></span> The logo features two strong elements: a spark-shaped icon that holds an abstract “M” within it and an extra, <em>extra</em> thick wordmark that puts the <em>mega</em> in Megaplex. Both elements are great on their own but I'm not 100% sure they belong together… I think two details save the relationship… first is the “M” within the icon that follows the angles and construction of the “M” in the wordmark and second is the diagonal flares at both ends of the lock-up with the icon and the “X” complementing each other nicely. Having two strong elements also allows each one to operate on its own as needed (or desired) in applications, which they do and it works quite well to have either of them take on primary branding duties.<span></span> Also on the fence, is my position on the icon variations… they are a little more on-topic than some of the more gratuitous efforts we've seen recently but these also have an AI-generated sheen that, at least to me is a little off-putting, but I can definitely see their potential and effectiveness in application for the general public. The identity then turns to <a href="https://capitalics.wtf/en/font/salo" target="_blank">Salo</a>, a lovely serif, as the primary headline typeface and while it may seem like an odd choice to complement the logo, I think its flaring plays perfectly well off of the icon. In a supporting role is the sans variable version of Salo, so there is a smooth relationship between the two styles. The concentric, radial gestures are fine but I'm not sure if it ends up being one thing too many in the toolkit, along with some stroked typography and the extra large silhouetted typography. Overall, as an entertainment destination and a place where so many experiences can be had for so many audiences, depending on the movie, the flexibility and broadness of the system makes sense and there is no denying that it's energetic, welcoming, and with just the right amount of Hollywood glitz.</p>

<p>
The old logo, with its lowercase geometric sans in mixed weights paired with a comparatively very heavy monogram (whose shape is presumably newspaper-related based on its evolution from the original logo, but not in any way I can recognize), felt like something hastily thrown together for a local radio station or small town library in 2005. That said, it is by far the best looking thing in relation to all the other old identity samples (that include former parent brand Signature Gifts… yikes), and looked especially out of place paired with the sappy, faux vintage clip art look of the original book covers. Overall the whole system, if you could call it that, felt very disjointed and dated in all the wrong ways.
</p>
<p>
The new logo is a hard departure from the old one in just about every way. The all caps wordmark, set in a compact, bold version of <a href="https://newglyph.com/typeface/swissposters/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Newglyph’s variable Swiss Posters</a>, is confident and unapologetic, immediately communicating “HEADLINE”. The monogram takes a blackletter approach reminiscent of a classic publication a la <em>The New York Times</em>, and while I like it aesthetically (I’m a sucker for blackletter), I immediately read it as “LJ” — it took me a minute to see the “H” in the negative space, and I had to be absolutely bludgeoned over the head with the explanation to see the “N”. That said, I’d argue that vibes are more important than legibility in this particular case — it’s not like anyone ever chose blackletter for its easy reading — and the sense of prestige and tradition provided by the monogram more than make up for the fact that it’s nearly impossible to decipher.
</p>
<p>
(Side note… I’m on the fence about the name. In an era where the norm is for a company to call itself, at best, a handful of letters loosely related to its product or service, there is something kind of refreshing about such a ridiculously literal, un-sexy name that describes EXACTLY what you’re getting. But “Historic Newspapers” doesn’t exactly roll off the tongue.)

<p>
The typography and layout systems double down on the newspaper theme, hammered home with a black and white palette and a bit of half-tone texture thrown in for good measure. Swiss Posters is joined by its utilitarian sister fonts <a href="https://newglyph.com/typeface/swisstime/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Swiss Time</a> and <a href="https://newglyph.com/typeface/swissnow/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Swiss Now</a> for a practical editorial flavor, which might get a little bit tedious were it not for <a href="https://www.sharptype.co/typefaces/respira" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sharp Type’s blackletter Respira</a> stepping in to bring some spicy ornamental flair to the party. Done poorly, all of these newspaper-y tropes in one place could easily cause the brand to come off as heavy-handed or even corny, but thanks to thoughtful typography pairings and a minimalist grid that employs a clear hierarchy and plenty of negative space, the result is a system that is equally as elegant as it is versatile.

<blockquote>
Previous book covers used an eclectic mix of typefaces with gold foil stamps on dark leather covers that only worked for sport and military themes and were feeling tired. 
<br></br>
The new cover design system with masthead logo, border devices, halftone imagery and headline typography is perfectly built, much like newspapers themselves, for different content types. By dialing up and down the various design elements, the covers can now be bright and poppy for entertainment themes and muted and more sophisticated for more somber topic areas.

<p>
The book cover design is where the system gets put to the test, having to walk a fine line between maintaining brand consistency and communicating the unique personality of each (wildly varied) subject matter. Ironically, this is where color becomes absolutely integral to a brand built around black and white— a broad secondary palette is what makes it possible for both the Story of Dolly Parton and the Recounting of the Falklands War to exist within the same brand guidelines.

Photography adds gravitas to the products, with books and newspapers shot on dark, textural surfaces – concrete, wood, velvet couches and bitumen.

The product imagery of books and newspapers were shot with blanks and have been setup as specific mockups for Historic Newspapers. Front pages and new cover designs can be automatically mapped to the photography, enabling rapid updates to designs and personalised imagery across the website. Users can select alternate cover designs and colours and see the changes immediately.

A cast of characters were assembled that would represent the different categories including sports fans, theatre goers, cinema buffs, rockers and pop believers. Borrowing from classic watch adverts, hands provide a sense of scale while jewellery, clothing and accessories add a sense of individuality and thematics.

I find that the most effective photos are the candid, close-up shots that focus on the product but provide a relatable human touch with a set of compelling hands and/or props. The cast of characters concept is great in theory, but I feel like they either needed to go all in on the characters with more specificity and depth to make them really believable, or lean more into the anonymous set of hands to let the viewer imagine the story for themselves — the over-stereotyped models posing with what are obviously Photoshopped mockups land us in an uncomfortable, uncanny valley-esque middle ground that, for me, takes away from the authenticity of the brand and custom product concept.

We went extra extra on the packaging with black on black halftone printed patterns, white screen print, semi transparent paper wrap, authenticity stamps, hand embossed elements and textural paper stocks. We created an entire range of packaging including:
<br></br>
— Cost effective options using robust cardboard rolls, referencing the rolled up newspapers thrown by delivery boys.
<br></br>
— Mid range solutions inspired by the wallets newspaper boys used to carry in by gone eras.
<br></br>
— High end archival storage boxes with draws for magnifying glasses and inserts for authenticity stickers.

Nothing especially surprising in the applications, but proof that the design system can easily move from print to digital to cylindrical tube without missing a beat, as well as a chance for the stellar copywriting to shine. “Extra extra” is absolutely brilliant in that it manages multiple meanings with literally one word (aided by two type treatments), and it could only work for this exact product at this exact moment in time. That hat gave me a proper chuckle and needs to be made immediately.

This update truly proves that well-considered branding, even with few kinks in the system, can be the difference between a cool idea and a major success. Very little changed about Historic Newspapers itself — the core product offerings, general methodology, even its incredibly un-sexy name all remain —  but a simple shift in presentation moved the entire operation out of corny keepsake and niche collector territory into something timeless, sophisticated, and broadly covetable, as proven by their massive jump in sales in the first month of testing the new cover designs (and by the fact that there are at least three sports fans in my life who will be receiving one of these books over the next year). Overall, I’d call it a newsworthy success.
