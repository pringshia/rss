The issue? Pentagram used Midjourney to train it with an illustration style of their own creation in order to generate over 1,500 icons to use on the website. Their Instagram post promoting the project has gathered more than 1,700 comments and… it&#8217;s not going well. Will an approach like this ever be acceptable in the creative industry? This definitely gives 1980s desktop revolution when the computer was the devil of our industry and now look at us.</p>

                                            <p><strong>Relevant quote</strong><br /><em>“I pointed the Elmwood team to the native star quilt, which is an important part of tribal symbology,” says Indigenous Pact co-founder and Oneida tribe member, Aimee Brenkus, “It’s composed of a number of triangles in purple – a very significant color for my Oneida community – that come together to form a star. We used this concept to craft a meaningful brand logo for Indigenous Pact that would resonate with our network of tribal leaders. It also powerfully communicates the benefits of our new Community Care model.”<br /><br />Designers at Elmwood then layered in an additional logo to represent the service model alone, revolving around a red circle in the center of the star. “You can think of this red circle as the individual surrounded by an expanding circle of support; whether that’s family, doctors or fellow tribe members. Everything flows from the single person in the middle to a wider community founded in values of proactive care and support.

                                            <p><strong>Opinion</strong><br />
                                            The old logo was not good, mostly due to the awkward wordmark typeset in Optima and its cartoony lowercase “i”. The eagle icon was arguably fine but also fairly generic. The new logo is infinitely more sophisticated while also being more in tune with healthcare industry aesthetics yet managing to not look as clinical or cold-hearted as most of those institutions are. The icon has an infectious optimism to it with its happy purple colors and radiant star shape and it's a lovely graphic abstraction of <a href="https://www.google.com/search?sca_esv=360d606574466e04&amp;sxsrf=ADLYWIKLNK1T1eokm0ZCvKLPHh1UZOESWQ:1733492995093&amp;q=native+star+quilt&amp;udm=2&amp;fbs=AEQNm0Aa4sjWe7Rqy32pFwRj0UkWd8nbOJfsBGGB5IQQO6L3J03RPjGV0MznOJ6Likin94pT_oR1DTSof42bOBxoTNxGeB1pS5_mub79WlyOO98XhEgJ5ByfFkeFUd9hlGBCmUZgrzLESyrkqGBL7osK5ZH3-0drzcH2VIMmwLRButbs-cMHhV8leQ--AYHsqw2WSrddKuHyCX6iowNOKZDTcJOO0G_14g&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwilucXRpJOKAxXFLtAFHemEMBkQtKgLegQIFhAB&amp;biw=1516&amp;bih=1139&amp;dpr=2" target="_blank">the Native star quilt motif</a>.<span></span> The name of the organization is a designer's nightmare because of the insanely different length of the two words and it's solved as nicely as possible here with two words in the same type size and the “g” landing neatly after the end of the second line and how the bottom and top slabs align with the horizontal strokes of the triangles in the star. The Community Care logo is a good extension but it's hard to not see Japan's flag in the icon.<span></span> The identity builds on the star and quilt concept with a series of geometric, monochrome compositions that can either be abstract patterns or more figurative spot illustrations. The kaleidoscopic animations are quite nice and there is an elegant restraint to all of the iterations that maintains a respectful reference to the source without it feeling too commercial or like gratuitous appropriation. The headline typography, using <a href="https://www.myfonts.com/collections/sagona-font-rene-bieder?refby=ucllc" target="_blank">Sagona</a>, is warm and approachable but also looks professional and the color palette is vibrant and lively without it being too jarring.<span></span> Overall, a sophisticated and culturally relevant identity that hopefully helps correct the disparity in care for American Indian and Alaska Native populations who, as shared by Elmwood, “have the lowest life expectancy in the United States” where “Indian Nation adults are almost three times more likely than non-Hispanic white adults to be diagnosed with, and die from, diabetes; while women are two times more likely to die of pregnancy-related causes.” I hate to close on such a downer of a note but that's the reality.</p>

                                                                    <img src="https://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/wp/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/friday_likes_517.jpg" alt="Friday Likes 517" />
                                
                                
                                
                                                                                
                                        
                                            
                                            <p>Some funky logos this week, with work from Belfast, Melbourne, and Seoul.</p>
<span id="more-300740"></span>

<h1 class="friday_likes">Drip by Hundred Studio</h1>
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/friday_likes_drip.jpg" alt="Drip by Hundred Studio" />

<p style="margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;"><a href="https://www.instagram.com/dripbelfast/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Drip</a> is a cafe in Belfast, Northern Ireland, serving tasty coffee beverages and brunch. The identity, designed by local firm <a href="https://hundredstudio.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hundred Studio</a>, is as self-explanatory as it gets: Drip is dripping. There is more to it of course because the logo could have been a regular wordmark with liquid coffee marks dripping down from it but instead this is a more slow, metaphorical, and nuanced drip as the elongated custom letters feel like gravity is pulling them down in slow, dramatic motion with the counterspaces holding on strong. Anyway, that&#8217;s too much philosophizing about an instantly endearing wordmark. The “ri” ligature is also very charmingly resolved. The application is just the logo on things in a black, orange, and white color palette but the door handles deserve a standing ovation. (I hate to be that person but did they get them backwards though? The “d” on the door is the “p” in the logo and “p” is the “d”.)  <span class="pagination_divider"></span><span class="small_caps"><a href="https://hundredstudio.co.uk/projects/drip/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">See full project</a></span></p>

<h1 class="friday_likes">Bed by Thought &amp; Found</h1>
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/friday_likes_bed.jpg" alt="Bed by Thought &amp; Found" />

<p style="margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;"><a href="https://bedpilates.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bed</a> is a pilates studio in Newton, Victoria, Australia that promises a chill environment and a killer workout. The identity, designed by Melbourne, Australia-based <a href="https://thoughtandfound.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Thought &amp; Found</a>, is very much unlike any other fitness brand out there that either tries to be all streamline-y or all holistic-y or all athletic-y by introducing a pillow-y logo with really odd letterforms, which is kind of a nice, subconscious way of signaling “all bodies welcome” or at least my-190-pound-body-stuffed-into-tight-leggings is welcome. I&#8217;m not 100% convinced I like the logo but it definitely caught my attention as something completely unconventional, which becomes more unhinged as the letters are given legs and shoes placed in all the seemingly wrong places for non-flexible humans like myself but perfectly achievable for those mastering pilates. The playfulness of the logo is extended into the typography that uses <a href="https://ladd-design.com/family/neulis/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Neulis Cursive</a>, that inserts cursive characters within a Roman sans serif. It&#8217;s all a bit of a weird flex but that is literally what pilates is, one weird flex after another and another and another. <span class="pagination_divider"></span><span class="small_caps"><a href="https://thoughtandfound.co/bed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">See full project</a></span>

<h1 class="friday_likes">Lazy Styles by Tom&amp;nick</h1>
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/friday_likes_lazy_styles.jpg" alt="Lazy Styles by Tom&amp;nick" />

<p style="margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:30px!important;"><a href="https://www.instagram.com/lazystyles_official/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lazy Styles</a> is a loungewear brand created by <a href="https://www.plazastyle.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PLAZA STYLE</a>, a Japanese retailer that sells pretty much every imaginable product category offering both well-known brands as well as their own private labels. The identity, designed by Seoul, South Korea-based <a href="https://www.tomandnick.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tom&amp;nick</a>, revolves around an unconventional monospace wordmark inspired by, of all things, a bookshelf, which the design team explains as “symbolizing the collection and documentation of comfortable experiences”. I&#8217;m not sure how that translates to loungewear but I am also not going to question it too much because I really like the resulting logo with its dramatically flat tops and bottoms. A secondary “LS” monogram keeps the proportions of the letters in the logo but executes it in an extra curvy style. As a fun contrast, the identity uses Emigre&#8217;s <a href="https://www.myfonts.com/collections/program-font-emigre/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Program Narrow</a> in its bolder weights and it looks pretty great — a nice reminder of how fun (if hard to use) Emigre fonts are. Not much in actual application, although you can see how the system comes into play in the products themselves <a href="https://www.lazy-styles.com/?fbclid=PAZXh0bgNhZW0CMTEAAaZ2EzyY32BIQkqwRQp9lXSAD045itDTFX_LA_L-sqXM9L9BAy5ZhN0UlGY_aem__E91bfQNiY_J7qi5lMlk6Q" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on their online shop</a> — they have some wild production things like <a href="https://www.lazy-styles.com/products/ls4201006a-f-peach" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this embroidery on the inside of a hoodie</a> or <a href="https://www.lazy-styles.com/products/ls4201005a-f-peach" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this cut-out heart crop top</a>. <span class="pagination_divider"></span><span class="small_caps"><a href="https://www.tomandnick.com/lazystyles" target="_blank" rel="noopener">See full project</a></span></p>

The tournament is organised by the unions of the six participating nations under the banner of Six Nations Rugby, which is responsible for the promotion and operation of the men&#8217;s, women&#8217;s and under-20s tournaments, and the Autumn International Series, as well as the negotiation and management of their centralised commercial rights.&#8221; (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_Nations_Championship" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wikipedia</a>)</p>

                                            <p><strong>Opinion</strong><br />
                                            Perhaps it should have been obvious but for the life of me I did not see this until I read that the old logo was a rugby ball with a little swash to make it look like a “6”. Clever, if a little forced. If I understand things correctly the new logo is more new-ISH than completely new given that it takes its cues from the Women's Six Nations Championship, which I'm not exactly sure when it was first introduced but based on some glitchy results from Wayback Archive it precedes it by at least a year as does the Under-20 logo. Now, all three championships are unified under the same premise with the men's and women's logos being very nicely in sync with the matching transparent ball and the same treatment on the “W” and the “M”. For some maddening reason, however, they did not update the ball for the Under-20 logo and I do not understand why… there is no reasoning why it shouldn't be the same but just yellow. Anyway… at first glance, they look like a family.<span></span> As I watched the first part of the identity intro video and how it described the logo as a "modern classic", having “the feel of pressed metal”, conveying “warmth and optimism”, and featuring a “refined bevel” I kept thinking “Are you talking about the same logo I am looking at? Because none of those things apply.” The logos are not particularly good but I have to admit that I was kind of excited by the identity thanks to the intro video, which showcases some energetic typography, bold colors, and engaging motion behaviors that appropriately reflect the spirit of the sport. The type choices are unconventional but not wrong and the color palette is actually quite nice, although a big departure from the red, green, and blue color system of before (that reflected the design of the game ball) which could be a risk. Overall, the logos are slightly convoluted and overwrought but with the support of a punchy identity this should be, <a href="https://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/new_logo_and_identity_for_f_c__kobenhavn_by_kontrapunkt.php" target="_blank">as they say in rugby</a>, a home run.</p>

<blockquote>Designed for both internal teams and external clients, the new brand system is rooted in adaptability. While competitors often emphasize rigid, fortress-like security, Centersquare takes a different approach which informs the company’s new positioning: &#8220;Infinite Flexibility. Absolute Certainty.&#8221;<br /><br />At the core of the brand is a nested square logo, created by custom letterer Simon Walker, to symbolize stability within a dynamic structure. A compact primary logo is complemented by a secondary wordmark for versatile application.</blockquote><h3>Jones Knowles Ritchie provided text</h3>

<p>The old logos were relatively fine within the context of B2B data centers where the design expectations are probably not as high as long as the servers are up and running. Evoque had a good idea of turning its “OQ” pair into an infinity symbol and with better execution it could have been a great wordmark. Cyxtera used a “C” monogram shaped like a server rack unit and had a nicely spaced wordmark. So there was at least <em>some</em> level of good design the new logo had to meet.</p>

<p>Pulling off a rather difficult typographic trick, the logo forms a square on its outer contour and then forms another square in its interior by shortening the four letters in the middle. It looks like a simple puzzle to solve but getting the balance right so that the “NT” and “UA” pairs don&#8217;t feel tiny is no easy feat and solving the tail of the “Q” to lay flat requires some finesse. Challenges that the logo meets with aplomb to deliver a tight, balanced united that not only reads easily both literally as you read the two words but also visually as you see the center square inside the letters. It&#8217;s a pretty great logo. My one complaint and this may have to do more with the name is that I keep thinking of this logo as being for a shopping mall or a small retail and entertainment neighborhood, not necessarily a data center.</p>

<p>Helping place the logo within the right context though are the various aggregated-data-looking illustrations that can live within the center square, emanate from it, or traverse across it. (To my point in the previous paragraph, you could put photos of food or gifts and it would make a very convincing retail destination logo but I&#8217;ll drop that line of thinking now.) The graphics can be integrated into the logo in four different ways — Inset, On Top, Pass Through, and Interwoven — which is a smart way of creating some flexibility and variety in the system but as much as I like the interplay of the graphics with the typography, all of the examples above feel random. Like, there is nothing that ties one graphic to the next other than being all wacky and motion-y and there is no real connection between them and the logo. I don&#8217;t know if all of these needed some restraint in the colors used or the shapes they are based off or anything else to tie them together more cohesively in concept and execution.</p>

<p>The identity elements are all fine. The primary colors of black, taupe, and white are a nice combination but the accent colors are maybe a little random. The typography looks excellent in the very nice <a href="https://peregrinstudio.com/work/systemia" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Systemia</a> although I may be swayed into that opinion by the hypnotic animation on those type specimens. The spot illustrations in perspective are slick.</p>

<p class="end">The applications are all fine but perhaps a little all over the place. I mean, the layouts are all relatively the same but when the various data-generated graphics are inserted into them, it becomes chaotic and hard to follow what they are all trying to achieve or convey. Overall, this is a technically proficient identity with a lot of great individual elements that add up to a techie and Matrix-y vibe, which is apt, but but their integration comes across as somewhat forced. I also feel like the identity should convey a sense of safety, control, and peace of mind but I can also buy into the premise that data center identities can be more fun, exciting, and daring, which is commendable that the client opted to go this route.</p>
