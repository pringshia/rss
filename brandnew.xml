Previously a generic breed of sheep was being used instead of the more appropriate Roscommon Sheep, which is one of only two native breeds in Ireland. This all started because in 2023, local sheep breeders at a council meeting of the Roscommon County Council questioned whether <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roscommon_County_Council#/media/File:Roscommon_COA.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the council&#8217;s own crest</a> was using the wrong breed of sheep on their crest. While that wasn&#8217;t the case and they were using the correct breed, this episode raised awareness of sheep misrepresentation in Ireland and that&#8217;s a happy ending if you ask me.

                                            <p><strong>Relevant quote</strong><br /><em>Our explorations led us to the tagline ‘Start with Impossible’ which captures DNEG’s uncompromising approach and its commitment to producing visionary work. The tagline draws on the insight that every creation begins with a leap of the imagination, paving the way for new realities and groundbreaking achievements.<br /><br />For a brand synonymous with best-in-class moving images, it was only fitting that the DNEG brand itself was built to move. From our vision through to creating graphics, layouts and typography, movement informs every aspect.<br /><br />We developed a Vision animation to show the category-defining work that happens each and every day at DNEG, turning blank slates into boundary-pushing creations. Through a lens-like eye, abstract streaks in ethereal colours refract and swirl, visualizing the process of creativity at work. The lights accelerate forwards towards a vanishing point before dissolving into the fully-realised DNEG creation.<br /><br />Our typography toolkit is flexible and allows for adjusting the desired level of impact based on the content being shown. DNEG Script is the distinctive headline typeface. It is custom cut and created in collaboration with Lift Type.<br /><br />As a crucial piece of the brand identity, we gave the logo a subtle facelift while respecting its established recognition.

                                            <p><strong>Opinion</strong><br />
                                            The logo evolution will largely pass unnoticed as it requires a microscope to figure out the changes but they are there and mostly beneficial. The primary one addresses one of my biggest annoyances in typography — throwing in random rounded corners in otherwise straight letterforms — by replacing the old “N” and “E” with regular letterforms that make sense. Another change, or more like a fix, is that the “D” and the “G” now dip slightly below the baseline with a proper overshoot, whereas before they sat directly on the baseline but then were wildly over the top, literally. Holding on to the “D” and “G” treatment where they share the same glyph rotated 180 degrees is fine, I guess, but I don't think it's as good or clever as the company thinks it is, as it makes for a really awkward “D”. Anyway, changing the logo apparently wasn't on the table so the few tweaks will have to do.<span></span> The identity relies on two main elements: A custom sans serif and a radiating-eye graphic device. The custom typeface is fine, if perhaps a little too close for comfort to <a href="https://fonts.floriankarsten.com/fk-screamer" target="_blank">FK Screamer</a> but as last year's trends (<a href="https://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/the_year_in_review_part_2_recurring_trends_2024.php" target="_blank">see #3</a>) show, it's hard to go wrong with a condensed grotesque and this one is no different, looking good throughout all applications and I really like how they've paired it with the wider <a href="https://www.kometa.xyz/buy/attila-sans/" target="_blank">Attila Sans</a> that is used in full-justified blocks of text at tiny sizes, giving it a slick, wide-screen cinematic vibe. The “eye” graphic device is good eye candy while also functioning as a sort of common denominator or shorthand to represent “visual effects”: it has some 3D, it has some light flares, it has motion, it has depth, it can shift colors, and it can morph from a sphere to one of those fancy new concave <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/20/how-the-mandalorian-and-ilm-invisibly-reinvented-film-and-tv-production/" target="_blank">big-ass screens</a> to a flat background. It's not the coolest effect ever, especially in contrast to the amazing stuff DNEG does but that's actually its most positive attribute: it doesn't outshine or overshadow DNEG's actual work and serves as a relatively neutral background to display the work.<span></span> The few applications shown are pretty good thanks to the typography and the slick imagery available but they also show how out of place the logo feels as it doesn't really have any relationship to the typography and it's not as strong of a mark to stand out amidst all of the stuff around it. Overall, this solves the difficult task of giving an already visually-exciting product an identity that has a voice and visual language of its own that can equally support, promote, or highlight all of the eye-popping visual effects work of DNEG.</p>

<h1 class="friday_likes">Wildfish Cannery by The Young Jerks</h1>
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/friday_likes_wildfish.jpg" alt="Wildfish Cannery by The Young Jerks" />

<p style="margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;"><a href="https://wildfishcannery.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wildfish Cannery</a> is a third generation family-owned cannery in Klawock, Alaska, that offers smoked and canned seafood using only sustainable, wild-caught seafood harvested by fishermen and divers from Alaska&#8217;s responsibly-managed, community-based fisheries. The packaging, designed by Brooklyn, NY-based <a href="https://youngjerks.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Young Jerks</a>, is an absolute delight that takes inspiration from <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=antique+canned+food&#038;sca_esv=c4b1341a4b7b7a8e&#038;udm=2&#038;biw=1919&#038;bih=1152&#038;sxsrf=AHTn8zp8Inc-g8lj0M97ZzK0QNJ-LDnTBw%3A1738924354717&#038;ei=QuGlZ469K-bW5NoPqo37kAE&#038;oq=antique+canned+f&#038;gs_lp=EgNpbWciEGFudGlxdWUgY2FubmVkIGYqAggAMgQQABgeSPUkULIGWL0bcAN4AJABAJgBRKABiAeqAQIxNrgBA8gBAPgBAZgCE6ACswfCAgQQIxgnwgILEAAYgAQYsQMYgwHCAgUQABiABMICBBAAGAPCAg4QABiABBixAxiDARiKBcICChAAGIAEGEMYigXCAggQABiABBixA8ICDRAAGIAEGLEDGEMYigXCAgYQABgFGB7CAgYQABgIGB6YAwCIBgGSBwIxOaAHgE8&#038;sclient=img" target="_blank" rel="noopener">antique canned food</a> and is then filtered through The Young Jerks&#8217; sensibility that always results in an extra satisfying combination of typography and illustration. In this case, a charming “W” made from two fish leads the way accompanied by a slightly quirky sans serif deployed with drop shadows and outlines and some fun spot illustrations for each of the offerings. The packaging is exactly how I like my canned fish: densely packed and flavorful. <span class="pagination_divider"></span><span class="small_caps"><a href="https://youngjerks.com/Wildfish" target="_blank" rel="noopener">See full project</a></span></p>

<h1 class="friday_likes">Pulire by Daria Stetsenko</h1>
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/friday_likes_pulire.jpg" alt="Pulire by Daria Stetsenko" />

<p style="margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;"><a href="https://www.instagram.com/pulire.masks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pulire</a> offers a very specific product of “masks” used to prevent makeup from getting on clothes and/or messing up your hair while changing clothes. Based in Ukraine, the brand, unfortunately, posted only four days ago that it had to pause its business after only a couple years of operation, so it might be a little too late to praise its packaging but maybe it serves as a note of encouragement. The packaging, designed by Kyiv, Ukraine-based <a href="https://www.behance.net/dariastetsenko" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Daria Stetsenko</a>, is the complete opposite of Wildfish Cannery with an intensely minimalist design, debossing the logo on a delightfully pink box. This could have been too bare even for the most hardcore minimalist out there but the hue of pink is perfect and the wordmark has just the right amount of character with its high-waisted “P” and “R” (and the latter&#8217;s unique leg) to make a bold statement. The smaller box, with the logo printed on it is nice too, allowing the logo to have a moment in the spotlight. The packaging is exactly how I like my makeup-protecting masks: crisp and clean. <span class="pagination_divider"></span><span class="small_caps"><a href="https://www.behance.net/gallery/217342353/Pulire" target="_blank" rel="noopener">See full project</a></span>

<h1 class="friday_likes">Senza Maeso by Toro Pinto</h1>
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/friday_likes_senzamaeso.jpg" alt="Senza Maeso by Toro Pinto" />

<p style="margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:30px!important;"><a href="https://www.senzamaeso.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Senza Maeso</a> is a distillery in San Marcos, TX, started by twin brothers whose flagship product is a hybrid between spirit and liqueur using the South American cape gooseberry and at 40% ABV and 80 proof, it packs a punch. The packaging and identity, designed by Guadalajara, Mexico-based <a href="https://toro-pinto.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Toro Pinto</a>, is a trippy blend of Senza Maeso&#8217;s founders&#8217; own inspiration: “Ray Bradbury, sacred geometry, Carl Sagan, duality, the weird future”. Getting that as a brief would be a head-scratcher but Toro Pinto has delivered with a slightly bonkers wordmark that looks like nothing else out there and a series of geometric illustrations rendered in some lovely grainy gradients that look like literally the path to enlightenment and ascendance to a higher plane. I love how the illustration extends to actual objects and patterns in the promotional photography, which is absolutely awesome, not to mention that their tasting room <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Senza+Maeso+Tasting+Room+and+Bar/@29.9399043,-98.1062721,3a,75y,90t/data=!3m8!1e2!3m6!1sAF1QipM-V0MlnuI1G4z3ExBkbi5-GDtlys7zO_r--aez!2e10!3e12!6shttps:%2F%2Flh5.googleusercontent.com%2Fp%2FAF1QipM-V0MlnuI1G4z3ExBkbi5-GDtlys7zO_r--aez%3Dw224-h313-k-no!7i1143!8i1600!4m9!3m8!1s0x865b5f353ec27c35:0xe6f6b37b908f6ad1!8m2!3d29.9399043!4d-98.1062721!10e5!14m1!1BCgIgAQ!16s%2Fg%2F11m_kgmp57?entry=ttu&#038;g_ep=EgoyMDI1MDIwNC4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is equally out there</a>. The packaging is exactly how I like my hybrid spirits: cosmic and surrealist. (Yeah, I know, this last closing makes no sense after starting out strong with the first one but I had to commit to the bit.) <span class="pagination_divider"></span><span class="small_caps"><a href="https://www.behance.net/gallery/145452435/SENZA-MAESOhybrid-spirit" target="_blank" rel="noopener">See full project</a></span></p>

                                            <p>(Est. 2023) &#8220;With <a href="https://www.otur.be/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Otur</a>, designer David Raes aims to craft objects that feel as relevant today as they will decades from now. From a childhood love for round, cylindrical shapes to Bernd &#038; Hilla Becher’s Grundformen. Otur’s creations are entirely handmade in Belgium. From the wood base to the linen shade, a local network of craftsmen turns every lamp into a unique piece. No two are the same. Otur’s home base of Kortrijk has a rich history in flax and textiles. That’s why we picked a local partner for the creation of our lamp shades that stand out by magically revealing the natural fibres of this material. Details matter: that’s why every piece is equipped with a solid bakelite switch, an elegant textile cable and a distinct plug. To finish it off, we placed a felt bottom on our lamps, so they glide smoothly and land softly wherever you place them.&#8221; (Google-translated)</p>

Each component is handmade in Belgium: a turned wooden base, and a lampshade made of locally produced linen. No two lamps are identical, which is what makes Otur so authentic.<br /><br />The shapes and textures of the lamps inform every detail in the branding. The lamps' top view inspired the custom wordmark, and their iconic silhouettes are also reflected in the visual identity. Website and packaging reinforce the sense of quality, care and timeless design.<br /><br />At Otur, the attention to detail doesn’t stop at the lamps themselves. For the packaging, we created a concept that exudes the same quality. Every element is designed not only to protect, but also to convey the story of Belgian craftsmanship and timeless design.

                                            <p><strong>Opinion</strong><br />
                                            I don't how much the old logo qualified as a proper logo given that it was just type out of the box and it had such a short lifespan but, in the context of the lamp designs, it definitely felt cold and mechanical, something the new logo corrects with aplomb. Taking the opposite approach with an extra chunky geometric sans construction, a new dark brown color, and tight typesetting, the new logo exudes warmth and coziness. It's definitely not anything new or different and we've all seen dozens of geometrically-constructed wordmarks like this one but the combination of letters in the name is particularly fruitful for the style and, again, in the context of the lamp designs, it's perfectly fitting. The lamps, by the way, are gorgeous if a bit out of reach at €1,300 each.<span></span> With an elegant restraint, the applications are all fine in their use of the brown and tan color palette, the minimalist typography employing <a href="https://displaay.net/typeface/saans-collection/saans/" target="_blank">Saans</a>, and the lovely photography that really helps sell the materials and craft of the lamps. The little chunky lamp drawings are a good detail too and I really like their contrast with the more diagrammatic, thin-line drawings. The proposed packaging looks good too, although not sure why black has made it unto the renders, especially since dark brown on kraft boxes would look killer. Overall, a simple yet satisfying identity that does a good job in exalting the quality of the lamps (and validating their prices).</p>

With over 11,000 employees worldwide, the company is dedicated to sustainable energy and mobility with the ambition to “drive Europe’s energy transition and accelerate decarbonisation both within the company and for its customers” as well as to &#8220;lead in the production of sustainable energy powered by green molecules, including green hydrogen and second-generation biofuels, as well as sustainable chemical products and ultra-fast electric mobility”. The name change is part of the company&#8217;s <a href="https://www.moeveglobal.com/en/the-company/strategy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2030 Positive Motion strategic plan</a> and, with it, Moeve has introduced a new identity designed by <a href="https://landor.com/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Landor</a>.</p>

<blockquote>The new brand, developed in collaboration with the agency Landor, reflects movement, optimism and evolution through different colours, textures and dimensions, with a design conceived for the digital world. “Moeve is a distinctive name designed to lead customers, markets and society towards a brighter future. The brand’s new colours feature inspiring tones that challenge the status quo, breaking from tradition to pave the way for a world of sustainable energy and mobility, in line with our new strategy,” says Pierre-Yves Sachet, Head of Brand and Director of Mobility and New Commerce.</blockquote><h3><a href="https://www.moeveglobal.com/en/press/cepsa-is-becoming-moeve" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Moeve press release</a></h3>

</figure>

<p>With hundreds of service stations across Spain, Cepsa had one of the most recognizable logos and names in the country and the fuel industry, with nearly 100 years of equity, which in the fuel industry could be as much equity as it is baggage and is probably the main reason for the dramatic name change. Shifting the company&#8217;s focus from traditional fuel to “sustainable energy powered by green molecules, including green hydrogen and second-generation biofuels” while also trying to shift its customers&#8217; perception and accept it as this more environmentally benevolent corporation most likely meant that Cepsa, and its 90-plus years of associations, was not going to make that possible. Moeve, pronounced like the combination of the name Moe and the mountain Everest, seems like a good name, especially for Spain, as the name sounds like “mueve”, which is the word for “move” — as a Spanish/English speaker, it causes so many glitches when I try to read it but that&#8217;s my problem.</p>

<p>The old logo had a bit of a corporate villain vibe with its ambiguous, angled icon and all uppercase wordmark. Design-wise they were actually both pretty good (although not as good <a href="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/34/3f/0c/343f0c000d92816cdcf478ac726eaa9f.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">as its 1970s predecessor</a>) with the icon having a nice sense of motion and dynamism while the wordmark had a no-nonsense construction. The new logo goes to the complete end of the spectrum in almost all respects… from red to blue, from uppercase to lowercase, from angry angled sans serif italic to friendly geometric sans serif. All very effective visual cues to signal a 180-degree change for the company and while for the most part it&#8217;s a decent logo at first glance maybe it has one too many things going.</p>

<p>The first thing you notice is the peculiar “m” where the open, skewed vertical strokes are meant to represent doors — as in doors that open opportunities and yada yada yada — but even within that single glyph there is a lot going on. There is the detached strokes, the skewing of the two strokes, the tight internal corner contrasting with the wide exterior curve, and the unfinished outer stroke that doesn&#8217;t reach the far left side of the letter. To its credit, it <em>does</em> read like an “m” but it feels a little too over-designed. (Also, personally, I cannot not see <a href="https://www.google.com/search?sca_esv=0af04e46daa0125b&#038;sxsrf=AHTn8zouc8rGiIeQKCKsqFq4KyCylQvE3g:1738838406642&#038;q=metro+mexico+logo&#038;udm=2&#038;fbs=ABzOT_CWdhQLP1FcmU5B0fn3xuWpA-dk4wpBWOGsoR7DG5zJBki0xbyJIUgVJnlXKXyPv8j23ihMhCb4WU_zI8XEKEVa8ut54E0XAKGtMfjzOLX6qs86YnWvbojuo3ItzgR74F-kQwntOpHqd4-5c0On5b5dGtYLOVak9kGdUggxpzUvKw0AVUKKNQJcCqpo-3qeJdv85wqSQ9BtbtRJSdOH-iAp-b0lsA&#038;sa=X&#038;ved=2ahUKEwih0LLs7a6LAxWOKlkFHU31Km4QtKgLegQIEBAB&#038;biw=1988&#038;bih=1152&#038;dpr=2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mexico City&#8217;s Metro logo</a> in it.) Once you move past the initial “m”, then you have the tilted “e”s and the “v” with a rounded corner at the bottom, which is a gesture that doesn&#8217;t happen anywhere else in the logo. Again, it&#8217;s a fine logo as long as you don&#8217;t stare too long at it and let questions arise.</p>

<p>On its own, the “m” from the logo works actually quite well as a standalone monogram where all of its quirks and details don&#8217;t have to compete or blend in with other letters. The 3D variations are arguably okay but this obsession with activating logos like this has either got to stop or evolve into something more interesting than what we&#8217;ve been seeing these past couple of years, which is becoming very repetitive.</p>

<p>The custom typeface is kind of strange… introducing some quirky ink traps that become too distracting and that have no visual or conceptual relationship to the logo or the rest of the angle-driven identity. Looking at the word “Bespoke” in the first image in the set above is kind of painful… that poor “B”. The one compliment I can give it is that the alternate tilted “e”s to match the logo are… useful.</p>

<p>The identity system also has a lot going on but its primary “door” premise and approach is actually kind of interesting and a clever and relatively unique way of establishing a visual language. In its flat color applications, unfortunately, things feel literally flat but it could just be that the samples shown above are just starting points and proofs of concept, not necessarily finished pieces of communication. Something about the color combinations, the silhouetted photography, and the sort of floating typography makes everything look unfinished. The introduction of gradients and glows of light are quite nice if somewhat arbitrary but I do like the effect they have when used on thinner strokes as seen in the opening seconds of the video for the icon set and in the abstracted door-opening animation. Then there is the illustrations that feel too youthful and playful, especially when combined with the pastel hues. It seems like elements from the different design directions presented were all brought together into a single identity and it&#8217;s not the most cohesive.</p>

<blockquote>Moeve is revolutionizing the service station market with the launch of its new range of establishments, moving forward in its Positive Motion transformation strategy. The energy company presented its flagship of the new network of service stations today in Madrid entailing a distinctive new customer experience focused on multi-energy supply alongside food, leisure, and shopping services. Moeve plans to convert its 1,800 service stations in Spain and Portugal under this new concept, creating a space for customers to enjoy a personalized and pleasant experience.</blockquote><h3><a href="https://www.moeveglobal.com/en/press/moeve-boosts-digitalized-and-more-sustainable-service-stations" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Moeve press release</a></h3>

<p>The service stations, which will be the primary touchpoint with the majority of customers, are fine. I feel like these needed to somehow be showstoppers and be extra cool to help the brand assert its dominance but they are kind of shy and the blue blends in too much into the environment while <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=cepsa+estacion&#038;sca_esv=0af04e46daa0125b&#038;udm=2&#038;biw=1988&#038;bih=1152&#038;sxsrf=AHTn8zpaRrOBE-Khq9-ee3Z4TjQx_pc3RQ%3A1738836769909&#038;ei=IYukZ7GON8Cg5NoPwbvsyQ0&#038;ved=0ahUKEwjxovjf566LAxVAEFkFHcEdO9kQ4dUDCBU&#038;uact=5&#038;oq=cepsa+estacion&#038;gs_lp=EgNpbWciDmNlcHNhIGVzdGFjaW9uMgUQABiABDIEEAAYHjIEEAAYHjIEEAAYHjIEEAAYHjIEEAAYHjIEEAAYHjIEEAAYHjIEEAAYHjIGEAAYCBgeSJUfUKEKWKQdcAN4AJABAJgBPqABggSqAQE5uAEDyAEA-AEBmAIMoAKgBMICBxAAGIAEGAqYAwCIBgGSBwIxMqAH_y0&#038;sclient=img" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the old Cepsa service stations were hard to miss</a>.</p>

<p class="end">Overall, there is no single “wow” moment here or some sort of galvanizing concept or execution to get people to rally behind this significant name change while there are too many competing ideas and visual approaches when breaking it down but the reality for the general consumer and any B2B clientele is that this is a perfectly functional and expandable identity that conveys a corporate-yet-friendly presence for Moeve.</p>

                                            <p>After a year of trying out a third-party logistics service to fulfill the <a href="https://brandnewshop.underconsideration.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Brand New Shop</a> orders we&#8217;ve realized that, as a small business that is NOT focused on retail, the cost does not make sense for the amount of inventory we generate and move. It was super nice to not have to pack things and create labels ourselves and the service we chose, Shipmonk, was actually pretty great but the expense simply did not add up for us.</p>

<p>So, in order to make a dent into our inventory at their warehouse before having to do an extraction mission that will be costly on freight shipping costs, <strong>we are offering all of our products at 30% off</strong> plus free shipping within the U.S. and $15 flat rate for the rest of the world.</p>

<p>We will be closing our warehouse account at the end of February and the discount will end then or until supplies last.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;ve been considering a Brand New hoodie, tote bag, cap, or t-shirt, <a href="https://brandnewshop.underconsideration.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">now&#8217;s the time to strike</a>.</p>
