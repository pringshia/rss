In 2010, we had a simple idea: to produce and sell the world‚Äôs first recycling bin made out of 100% post-consumer plastic. Today, our Ubin and Ubin mini are the recycling bins of choice for hundreds of offices in the UK and Europe. With a widening international base and new products in the works, we‚Äôre looking ahead to a future of eco-friendly innovation.&#8221;</p>

                                            <p><strong>Relevant quote</strong><br /><em>Reflecting Zeff‚Äôs detail-orientated ethos, the identity makes the process and information behind Zeff products clear and accessible, using a technical, engineered visual language to communicate Zeff‚Äôs design expertise and sustainability benefits. From the diagrams describing the bin‚Äôs features, to the motion-led product renders that reflect the brand‚Äôs precision, to the bespoke icons that illustrate different waste streams and sustainable practices, all elements double down on Zeff‚Äôs exacting approach. Similarly, Zeff‚Äôs bespoke, bold workmark reflects the brand‚Äôs product heritage with reference to the Ubin‚Äôs signature curves, whilst allowing space for future innovations.<br /><br />The brand identity subsequently influenced the product itself, with the introduction of a new set of Zeff waste stream colours that would sit as comfortably in an office or at home, as well as the introduction of the logo to the bin itself. Ultimately, our core concept ‚Äòtechnical and transparent‚Äô allows the brand to straddle both B2B and a future B2C audience, deftly balancing rigour with openness.

                                            <p><strong>Opinion</strong><br />
                                            The old name and logo were appallingly bad and hard to imagine that any kind of innovation would come out of that business other than just being a literal warehouse in the middle of nowhere that is literally painted green where one stores, like, old lawnmowers so there was a really big disconnect between their slick-looking bin and how they presented themselves to other businesses. Even as a B2B supplier, where there is usually less pressure to have a killer name, logo, and identity this was simply not good. Everything is a major improvement, starting with the new name, with Zeff being the term to describe the effective nuclear charge on an electron, which can be measured from the subtraction of the number of electrons between the nucleus and the electron from the number of protons in the nucleus ‚Äî but, of course, <a href="https://jackwestin.com/resources/mcat-content/electronic-structure/effective-nuclear-charge#:~:text=%E2%80%A2-,The%20effective%20nuclear%20charge%20is%20the%20net%20positive%20charge%20experienced,the%20number%20of%20shielding%20electrons.&amp;text=valence%20shell%3A%20is%20the%20outermost%20shell%20of%20every%20element." target="_blank">you knew that</a>. While no one probably actually knows what a Zeff is, getting the inside scoop that it comes from a scientific term is a testament to how seriously the company takes its commitment to sustainability and innovation. Even without that knowledge, it's simply a compact name that is easy to pronounce and remember.<span></span> Taking advantage of the shortness of the name, the logo goes big and bold with an extra chunky wordmark drawn with strict geometric gestures using only 0-, 45, and 90-degree angles finished off with perfectly round corners. It's not the most innovative or exciting of logos but the graphic approach works beautifully in this combination of letters with all of horizontal strokes and their resulting negative spaces neatly aligning all across. It would have perhaps been nice for the ‚ÄúZ‚Äù to have the 15-degree angle of the top of the bin but that would have yielded an endlessly wide ‚ÄúZ‚Äù (which could have been interesting but maybe not efficient). The logo also echoes the soft edges of the bin's lid and looks right at home on the base of it. The applications are fairly straightforward, adopting a minimalist look with a lot of white space and data-esque typography that allow for the bin photography to be the hero and when there is no bin in sight, the logo becomes the hero. The icon set is worth some praise too as it illustrates some uncommon subjects in pretty effective ways with an efficient use of lines. Overall, this is a drastically positive maturation for the business that better represents their product and that I am sure will position them as a supplier to be taken more seriously by enterprise buyers while also having just the right amount of personality to enter the consumer market.</p>

It has become a key player in the Flemish music scene, known for its youth-orientated content and eclectic music selection, spanning rock, electronic, indie, and hip-hop. Studio Brussel actively supports emerging artists and hosts popular events like De Warmste Week (a major charity campaign) and coverage of the annual music festival <a href="https://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/new_logo_and_identity_for_rock_werchter_by_tin.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rock Werchter</a>. To help amplify their brand, VRT enlisted the help of Europe-wide agency <a href="https://saffron-consultants.com/">Saffron</a>, unveiling their fresh look in late 2024.</p>

<blockquote>In a world of fragmented Tik-Tok trends, hyper-personalised playlists and antisocial algorithms, we created a refreshed brand with real resonance for a community of music lovers in Flanders.
Within the VRT ecosystem, Studio Brussel stands out as a dynamic and innovative audio brand known for its progressive music programming and youth-oriented content. Since its inception in 1983, Studio Brussel has carved a niche for itself as a trendsetter in Belgian music culture, showcasing emerging artists, promoting diversity, and fostering community engagement.

<p>The previous identity by Base Design<a href="https://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/new_logo_for_studio_brussels_by_base.php"> was covered in a 2019 noted post</a> and showcased a more modern, edgy approach to a radio identity, akin to other contemporary, and hip radio stations like NTS and Rinse FM (both London based). At the time Armin posed the question about its glitchy, edgy identity: &#8220;how long can this one trick last?&#8221; Well, here&#8217;s your answer! As it turns out, it left its audience a bit disconnected (Saffron&#8217;s words) and needed addressing to fall in line with VRT&#8217;s updated identity (also done by Saffron).</p> 

<p>The new logo takes them back to their roots; shifting away from the cooler &#8220;StuBru&#8221; back to its full name, Studio Brussel, and ditching the broken type for a microphone shape that instantly says &#8220;radio&#8221;. Furthermore, with the addition of the red to pink gradient, it begins to give off a sense of activity and even being &#8216;on air&#8217;. Over-rationalisation aside, it&#8217;s surprising how well the simple mic shape is, I made the connection instantly when I saw it and I credit that to the nice asymmetrical depth it&#8217;s been given. I&#8217;m less enthused about the logotype though. The two words have a nice tight kerning to them and I like the curve they adhere to on the mic shape, but I don&#8217;t quite understand the reasoning for splitting the two words into lowercase and uppercase. Having said this, it does seem to work and gives the logo a point of focus. Plus, points for being dynamic and a bit different. I&#8217;m just a bit of a stickler for proper sentence case, especially when there&#8217;s multiple words.</p>

<blockquote>The new design system centres on a simple yet powerful symbol‚Äîthe mic. It‚Äôs the heartbeat of the Studio Brussel brand, transcending genres, trends and subcultures, just like their diverse audience and the music they love.<br><br>
The graphic and motion mechanics around the mic capture the potential of our ‚Äòshared wavelengths‚Äô and speak to the power of music‚Äîthe ripple effect it has in bringing people together.

<p>Leading the line in the visual language are a series of pulsing wavelengths giving the identity a strong beat to dance to. It&#8217;s not exactly a novel approach when it comes to music/media related brands but does make complete sense for them. They come to life nicely in animation and establishes a consistent visual language for the brand. The wavelengths also start to work well with imagery, creating a glass-like pulse which looks wicked in the logo animation shown further above. I much prefer this to the simple line graphics, they&#8217;re far more distinctive and just <em>cooler</em> overall.</p>

<p>In addition to the graphic language, we have a bright purple, pink, and red colour palette helping to add some nice vividness and attitude to the designs, especially in the studio photography of the station hosts. The typography remains quite unremarkable, with a very functional sans serif, used in all caps. It&#8217;s worth noting you can see how the naming convention works for the other stations using the same rule from the logo. It&#8217;s starting to add up but still feels off to me!</p>

<blockquote>As an extension of the design toolkit we built for VRT, the Studio Brussel brand system introduces a range of versatile treatments and behaviours, brought to life across a spectrum of colours. This visual diversity captures Studio Brussel‚Äôs eclectic offer across their family of shows, streams, podcasts, and events. The new system is designed to be flexible enough to handle everything from techno to folk, hard rock to ambient, while still maintaining the Studio Brussel and VRT identity.
<br><br>
A key element of the refresh is the brand‚Äôs integration into VRT‚Äôs digital streaming platform, VRT MAX. The Studio Brussel brand is optimised for digital platforms and prioritises being easy to use for internal teams, helping designers‚Äô work shine consistently across any touchpoint.

The little tiles for each show make full use of the toolkit and almost look like mini posters in their own right, feeling both unique to each show but also consistent at the same time. Interesting here is that you see the icon version of the logo in each tile; the mic shape with an &#8216;sB&#8217;. Sorry still not vibing with the mix. (Last time I&#8217;ll mention that, promise). Overall, it&#8217;s a clean digital experience and it really <em>feels</em> like a diverse and contemporary radio station.</p>

<p>Across the event and experiential applications you can see how well the purples and pinks are working. Together with the patterns, they add a lot of brightness to signage and stages, grabbing attention and representing the energy of the music within.</p>

<p>Not much more to add from the applications; they all feel vibrant and consistent with the rest of the brand. We see a little snippet of tone of voice on the billboard and hoodie saying &#8220;life is MUSIC&#8221; (Nope, I won&#8217;t) which is appropriately platitudinous for merch from a cool radio station.</p>

<p class="end">All in all, Saffron have successfully done what I imagine they were asked to do and de-hip Studio Brussels to bring it back to its roots. For me, they have found the right frequency for the identity ‚Äî transitioning to a more conventional approach that centres around a simple, focused graphic system; allowing the music and artists to take the spotlight, while maintaining the energy and vibrancy Studio Brussel is known for.</p>

Centered on ‚ÄúFootball. But French,‚Äù we crafted a fresh look that captures the sport‚Äôs unique essence in France. We intended to challenge the status quo while ensuring adaptability for the future. Our logos use negative space to shape the letter ‚ÄòL‚Äô within the numbers, echoing the well-known abbreviations for Ligue 1 and Ligue 2.<br /><br />Flexibility was at the heart of our new identities, with LT designing logos that clubs and fans can make their own. Clubs, especially, are encouraged to adapt the design with their colors, embracing the new logo as part of their identity.<br /><br />The new identities for Ligue 1 and Ligue 2 feature bold and bright color palettes unified by a charcoal base. This dynamic look, inspired by video games, conveys a modern and playful brand universe. A custom typeface drives the identity and is carried through to jerseys and further adapted for TV graphics. A flexible grid system ensures the identities shine across digital, stadium, and TV platforms.

                                            <p><strong>Opinion</strong><br />
                                            Posted in Spotted ten months ago, the two logos got mixed reactions with the consensus being that the new ‚Äú1‚Äù was better resolved than the new ‚Äú2‚Äù. It was an ambitious move to integrate an ‚ÄúL‚Äù in the negative space of the two numbers and while they do come across as slightly different solutions ‚Äî the ‚Äú1‚Äù looking like an inline but the ‚Äú2‚Äù not ‚Äî I do think it was done as successfully as possible and there is a clear relationship between the two of them.  I'm not as big a fan of the supporting wordmarks as they feel like they are competing for attention and while they share some angular traits with the large ‚Äú1‚Äù and ‚Äú2‚Äù there is a bit of a clash when the italic structure of the numbers tries to find some harmony with the upright letters. I also find the repetition of the number of the league in the wordmark unnecessary and perhaps showing a lack of confidence in that people will be able to decode the big numbers. Nonetheless, I think the new logos are far more interesting than the two old ones with their ambiguous icons.<span></span> The identity revolves around a custom typeface that adopts some traditional sports cues with its sharp, angry angles and condensed structure but I feel like it goes overboard with too many angles at too sharp of a cut, becoming somewhat distracting and making larger blocks of text difficult to read. Personal appraisal aside, there is no denying that the type does look bold, energetic, and dynamic‚Ä¶ all good traits for a professional sports league and the introduction video helps sell the identity quite well, showing how the typography, team colors, and photography come together in bold blocks of text with a few fun sparks of a monospace font. The broadcast graphics look pretty attractive and there are some very nice motion gestures as information and data slips and slides across the screen. Overall, this may operate within some well-worn sports trends but, by doing so, it gets the job done efficiently and energetically.</p>
