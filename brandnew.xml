It takes its name after the classic Dutch breakfast of hagelslag which involves putting chocolate sprinkles on a slice of bread with butter. Hagelchup is promoted to accompany another Dutch classic, fries with mayo. NGL, as a big ketchup fan, these look delicious.

L’Observatoire de Paris-PSL is composed of 800 researchers, engineers, and administrative and technical staff who contribute to theoretical studies, instrumental innovation, and observation services for large ground-based telescopes, metrology, and space missions. Thanks to its expertise, L’Observatoire de Paris-PSL collaborates with the main players in astronomy on an international scale. L’Observatoire de Paris-PSL offers research-based teaching from the undergraduate to the doctoral level, as well as university degrees and training for teachers. Very involved in knowledge sharing, the institution offers educational resources for all levels and ages (class sponsorship, exhibitions, digital media, etc.) and participates in numerous events (Fête de la Science, etc.). Founded in 1667, L’Observatoire de Paris-PSL is spread over three sites (Paris, Meudon, Nançay). This large establishment of the Ministry of Higher Education, Research and Innovation is structured in scientific departments and services, linked to the CNRS and the major French universities.&#8221;</p>

                                            <p><strong>Relevant quote</strong><br /><em>The combination of the initials “O” and “P” has given rise to a completely new symbol, which can be likened to the representation of a solar system, with a satellite orbiting its star. This celestial object follows a spiral trajectory, symbolizing the phenomena of attraction and expansion. This “orbital monogram” anchors the Observatory's identity in the tradition of academic excellence.<br /><br />[We] decided to replace the dull midnight blue with a brilliant violet, which we named Ultra-violet, in reference to those wavelengths invisible to the naked eye, but which are nonetheless an integral part of astronomical observations (along with gamma rays, x-rays, infrared and radio waves). Violet is a guarantee of power and dreaminess. It is the royal color par excellence, recalling the history of this institution and its heritage dating back to the ancien régime. At the same time, this color confers a much more modern image, as it elicits both creativity and innovation through its particularly saturated appearance.<br /><br />The Observatory's identity and character are embodied in its logo and colors, of course, but also in its typography. This is Arago, a typeface specially designed for the Observatory, distinguished by its particularly geometric design. Its name refers to Francois Arago, an illustrious 19th-century French astronomer and physicist, after whom the famous dome on the roof of the Perrault building is named. The perfectly circular appearance of the letters is reminiscent of the round shape of the planets, as well as that of the portholes running around the dome.<br /><br />The principles of composition are directly inspired by the monogram. The silhouette of the monogram becomes a space for both text and image. By tilting this element a few degrees, the sign takes on a parabolic shape, reminiscent of the curve and trajectory of space objects, such as a rocket taking off. These shapes give the brand a dynamic yet contemplative appearance. In this way, the Observatory demonstrates its determination to perpetually advance the science of the universe, projecting itself into the future with serenity and confidence.

                                            <p><strong>Opinion</strong><br />
                                            The old logo had a somewhat interesting idea in playing with positive and negative contrasts to highlight the “Observ” part of the name as if you were seeing it at night. The execution had good intentions but ultimately it was rather clunky and unrefined. The giant tittle didn't help. The new logo introduces an icon that looks like a simplified solar system with a couple of planets orbiting around it while also doubling as an “OP” monogram. I wish the little dots weren't placed right in the middle of the icon and aligned one with the other to better convey the orbiting idea without needing to rely on animation — which is pretty nice, by the way. <span></span> The wordmark is typeset in the observatory's new custom typeface, Arago, a sans serif that comes in a classic and a geometric version, the latter of which is used in the logo. I've never been the biggest fan of this style of “a”s, “b”s, “d”s, “m”s, and “n”s that have their stem flow directly into the bowls or curves and, unfortunately, this is not the use that changes my mind. While it's technically fine, I feel like the wordmark ends up looking very un-serious and not like a world-class scientific facility and organization.<span></span> In application the geometric style of Arago becomes the primary headline typeface and, as with the wordmark, it doesn't feel quite right to me but I acknowledge that may just be a personal apprehension to this typographic style. The color palette is good with the violet color contrasting nicely with the off-black and off-white foundation. The layout system with the ovals is simple but effective and I do really like the animated treatments when the oval is used in a stroke and it interacts with the typography. Overall, this feels a little dated somehow and lacking some excitement to make this more engaging but it's certainly a significant improvement from where the identity was before.</p>

                                            <p>Some funky letterforms and typography across three very different categories this week, with work from New York and Los Angeles, Bordeaux, and Helsinki.</p>
<span id="more-298004"></span>

<h1 class="friday_likes">Gelée by RoAndCo</h1>
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/friday_likes_gelee.jpg" alt="Gelée by RoAndCo" />

<p style="margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;"><a href="https://geleegelee.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gelée</a> is a new packaged gelatin dessert described as a “lush, fruit-forward jelly that’s nourishing for the body, mind, and soul” available in delicious-sounding flavors like passion fruit, guava, and pineapple with coconut. The packaging, designed by New York, NY- and Los Angeles, CA-based <a href="https://www.roandcostudio.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RoAndCo</a>, has two very simple things going for it: A lovely, heavy-bottomed script wordmark and a pitch-perfect photo of the finished product. Minimal supporting typography in a serif and a monospace completes the front of the pack. The simplicity of the design allows the rich and warm tones of the molded jelly to stand out and drive craveability as the light hits it in just the right ways to make it look jelly-cious and serve as a perfect backdrop for the wordmark knocked out of it. As with many RoAndCo projects, this one also features some great art direction in the photography that makes the product live up to the “body, mind, and soul”-nourishing claim as I can feel my body, mind, and soul nourished just from looking at all of this. <span class="pagination_divider"></span><span class="small_caps"><a href="https://www.roandcostudio.com/work/gelee" target="_blank" rel="noopener">See full project</a></span></p>

<h1 class="friday_likes">Atelier Bulk by Abmo</h1>
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/friday_likes_atelierbulk.jpg" alt="Osteria Alberico by Studio Mast" />

<p style="margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;"><a href="https://www.atelierbulk.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Atelier Bulk</a> is a boutique printer in Eysines, France, specializing in foil stamping and other specialty techniques like curved foil stamping, micro-embossing, and edge-gilding. The identity, designed by Bordeaux, France-based <a href="https://www.abmo.fr/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Abmo</a>, combines the relatively trendy approach of a super-curvy letterform for a monogram and a fashion-esque deadpan sans serif for the wordmark. It&#8217;s a groovy pairing that conveys the art and craft of foil stamping through the ornate “B”s but also their proficiency and know-how with the sturdy and serious wordmark. For contrast, a sharp serif is used for headlines and a tennis-ball yellow-slash-green is added to the black and white foundation. Naturally, the applications are foil stamped and while everything looks better foil stamped those black-on-black “B”s on the little box are as good as it gets in this medium. <span class="pagination_divider"></span><span class="small_caps"><a href="https://www.behance.net/gallery/204447479/Atelier-Bulk-Branding" target="_blank" rel="noopener">See full project</a></span>

<h1 class="friday_likes">Friidu by Kuudes</h1>
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/friday_likes_friidu.jpg" alt="Friidu by Kuudes" />

<p style="margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:30px!important;"><a href="https://www.friidu.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Friidu</a> is a brand of plant-based ice cream available in Finland, offering bars and pints of decadent-sounding flavors like peanut butter and crunchy caramel, salty liquorice and creamy lemon swirl, or salted caramel. The packaging, designed by Helsinki, Finland-based <a href="https://kuudes.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kuudes</a>, is equally rich- and tasty-looking with OH no&#8217;s <a href="https://ohnotype.co/fonts/cheee" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cheee</a>, in its “Bingboing” variation, for the logo, looking all gooey and melty while a range of illustrations convey some of the flavors through the patterns on the characters&#8217; clothing. Unfortunately the illustrations do border on Corporate Memphis with the big limbs and small heads but the patterns do save them as does the color palette, which might be the best part of the identity as it surrounds the products with warm, friendly tones. If anyone in Finland wants to dry-ice-me via air mail a sample of the salty liquorice and creamy lemon swirl bar I won&#8217;t be mad at all. <span class="pagination_divider"></span><span class="small_caps"><a href="https://www.behance.net/gallery/206032051/FRIIDU-ICE-CREAM" target="_blank" rel="noopener">See full project</a></span></p>

                                            <p><strong>Relevant quote</strong><br /><em>We named the business ‘Pairpoint’ – a helpfully and deliberately descriptive name for a technology that’s both nascent and difficult to comprehend. Then, inspired by the dandelion’s ability to disperse widely and take root anywhere, a visual system that tells the story of devices becoming connected – in the widest sense of the word. At the heart of it all is a symbol that mirrors the behaviour of the technology; spreading and connecting, creating new life.<br /><br />Pairpoint’s new identity has been designed with the future in mind, extending far beyond the digital and physical marketing materials into potential digital and OOH environments. It has the ability to show up proudly in environments where the brand needs volume and presence, as well as take a back seat in data visualisation and UI. We’re excited to watch it grow.

                                            <p><strong>Opinion</strong><br />
                                            As soon as I saw the new icon I knew it was a dandelion, not because I'm smart or overly perceptive but because of how well the essence of a dandelion — spherical, fluffy, tufty, strand-y — has been captured with a single graphic element repeated, rotated, and spaced in just the right ways to convey its dimensionality and airiness. The animations further drive the concept home and they are also beautifully executed. The core shape that makes up the dandelion is then extracted to function in the same vein as a Bluetooth or Wi-Fi icon and it's simple enough that it could potentially work at the same level of recognition but that's only if this particular connectivity protocol becomes universal… otherwise it's just wishful thinking.<span></span> The wordmark, in a slightly customized version of <a href="https://displaay.net/typeface/denim-collection/denim-ink/" target="_blank">Denim Ink</a> looks pretty good and <em>pairs</em> — see what I did there? — quite nicely with the ink-swell-y icon within the icon. Not a whole lot in actual application but plenty of samples of a slick visual language. The low-key hero of the identity might be the color palette, which has a lovely combination of rich, muted dark colors contrasted by the pastel green. The visible grid with the little pieces of dandelion is also very satisfying. Overall, a polished and refined identity that nicely conveys the idea of a sprawling, spreading, connecting technology.</p>

Comprised of six teams in Boston, Minnesota, Montréal, New York, Ottawa, and Toronto, the league played its first season this year, lasting from January to May, with Minnesota winning the inaugural Walter Cup — named after the Mark Walter Group, which owns and operates the league. The PWHL has broken multiple attendance records and holds the worldwide all-time record for a women’s hockey game.  For the first season, the six teams had no names or logos and were simply called PWHL Boston, PWHL Minnesota, PWHL Montréal, PWHL New York, PWHL Ottawa, and PWHL Toronto while sporting the league&#8217;s logo. As it prepares for its second season, the league has introduced names and logos for all six teams, created by New York, NY-based <a href="https://www.flowershop.agency/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Flower Shop</a> in collaboration with <a href="https://f37.studio/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">F37® Studio</a>.</p>

<figcaption>All logos.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Although the old logos were definitely not fun, creative, or distinctive, there is something potentially interesting about a sports league where all logos and uniforms are systematically alike, focusing completely on the sport and not on the mascots or the merch or the halftime shows but that&#8217;s probably a kind of hellscape no North American sports fan wants any part of and it&#8217;s certainly no way to move merch. All designed by the same firm, the new logos all take a different direction and all look like they were done by a different firm, which is both a compliment and a criticism. The former being that it&#8217;s commendable that Flower Shop was able to go into completely different visual territories for each team but the latter in that I feel like there was an opportunity to actually create some kind of visual unifying thread and give the league a distinctive approach, especially now where there are only six teams and that kind of exercise would be more manageable before it expands. So, let&#8217;s get into each one…</p>

<p>Note: All of the animations have sound, so you can unmute each one. They are a little cringy and clichéd so you might be better off keeping them muted.</p>

<blockquote><strong>Boston Fleet</strong><br />‘Fleet’ pays homage to Boston’s collective spirit and rich maritime history, representing the city’s unified strength and resilience. The logo combines the iconic letter ‘B’ in the team’s primary deep green color with an anchor, symbolizing Boston&#8217;s identity and nautical heritage. The forward-leaning shape communicates momentum, reflecting the city&#8217;s sporting legacy and the team&#8217;s advancement on the ice.</blockquote><h3>Flower Shop provided text</h3>

<figcaption>Boston Fleet.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Adopting a nautical theme seems like a natural choice and the name “Fleet” is actually kind of bad-ass as it invokes a grouping of ships ready to attack. The “B” monogram blended with an anchor is kind of clever but, because it&#8217;s not facing down and because of its sharpness, it almost looks more like a fishing hook. The extruded and dimensional effect is decently solved and the waves inside add some nice texture but their execution is pretty amateurish. The wordmark sticks with the slanted structure and sharp angles for a more typical angry-spiky sports look.</p>

<blockquote><strong>Minnesota Frost</strong><br />‘Frost’ embodies the State of Hockey’s deep-rooted love for the ice— and the sport that has become a timeless tradition, bridging generations. The logo features a stylized letter ‘F’ in the team’s core purple with angular edges and sharp points, reminiscent of icicles, while the overall design conveys a sense of competitive intensity and fierceness.</blockquote><h3>Flower Shop provided text</h3>

<figcaption>Minnesota Frost.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>A fun name that is very apt for cold-as-balls Minnesota. The “F” monogram that&#8217;s meant to look like icicles is pretty decent with its chiseled, also angry-looking design. The full wordmark is very uncomfortable to look at with the modifications that they made on “FROST” to the same typeface used in “MINNESOTA”. The beziers have just been pulled and it feels like a sketch, where it still needed two or three rounds of development to actually be a cohesive piece of lettering.</p>

<blockquote><strong>Montréal Victoire</strong><br />‘Victoire’ embodies Montréal’s joyously competitive spirit, acting as inspiration for the city to climb to even greater sporting heights. Win or lose, ‘Victoire’ is a mindset, celebrating the city’s pursuit of achievement. The logo features wing-like shapes in the team’s signature deep burgundy color, subtly alluding to the Goddess of Victory and symbolizing strength and agility. A hidden ‘M’ within the wings pays homage to Greater Montréal. Additionally, a fleur-de-lis, a national symbol of Québec, is gracefully integrated and evokes the rich cultural history of the province and the city.</blockquote><h3>Flower Shop provided text</h3>

<figcaption>Montréal Victoire.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Victoire is probably the most visually successful and interesting logo of all six, with a fairly clever integration of a fleur-de-lis, an “M”, and some ambiguous bird of prey wings, all in a kind of gothic armor-like aesthetic. It&#8217;s also the one that has the best relationship between icon and wordmark in their angular construction. It also has a pretty nice animation.</p>

<blockquote><strong>New York Sirens</strong><br />‘Sirens’ is an ode to New York City’s one-of-a-kind energy, pace and rhythm – embodying the City’s sounds and people. Sirens also speaks to the sweet sound of the goal horn after the puck goes into the net. The logo, dominated by the team’s vibrant teal, reflects the intensity of New York and evokes the gritty cityscape. The reverberating ‘S’ visually mimics sound waves, and the angular design of the &#8216;NY&#8217; pays homage to New York&#8217;s iconic architecture.</blockquote><h3>Flower Shop provided text</h3>

<figcaption>New York Sirens.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>This is a very odd name… as the combination of “New York” and “Sirens” makes me think of police cars, ambulances, and fire trucks, which are the soundtrack of the city and I don&#8217;t really associate them with anything positive or fun. Visually, there is something interesting about the reverberation effect on the name and how it pairs with the blocky “NY” behind it, which is actually kind of cool. The color palette feels way more Seattle-esque than New York-esque, a feeling probably exacerbated by the word “Siren” which also makes me think of Starbucks (which is headquartered in Seattle). This is a good moment to bring up the fact that all new logos retain the color assigned to them in the first season, so that&#8217;s why this aqua blue features so prominently.</p>

<blockquote><strong>Ottawa Charge</strong><br />‘Charge’ pays tribute to Ottawa itself: from the city’s motto “Advance – Ottawa – En Avant”, nodding to its constant state of dynamic growth and forward progress as Canada’s Capital City. The logo, leading with the team’s core color red, features a monogram ‘O’ designed to convey a sense of energy and movement, signifying the team’s electrifying presence on the ice. The ‘O’ is crafted to resemble a spinning object brimming with electrical current, representing the power that the fans bring to every game. Spikes emanating from the back of the &#8220;O&#8221; allude to forward momentum. A faceted cut in the front of the ‘O’ introduces a slight nod to the letter ‘C’, linking the design back to the team&#8217;s name, ‘Charge’.</blockquote><h3>Flower Shop provided text</h3>

<figcaption>Ottawa Charge.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>This is the least successful of all six logos and by “least successful” I mean this is really bad. The name is good and with so many possibilities for doing something lightning-bolt-y, the ensuing “C” monogram is very awkward and the speed lines emanating from it are very poorly executed. Doubling down on that motif, they also appear in the full wordmark and it&#8217;s not any better.</p>

<blockquote><strong>Toronto Sceptres</strong><br />The “Sceptres” embody Toronto’s regal history and commanding presence, reflected in the moniker Queen City and iconic places like Queen Street—one of the city’s most culturally vibrant thoroughfares—connecting diverse neighborhoods and showcasing Toronto’s rich heritage. The ornamented Sceptre itself is a symbol of power and strength found in courts and palaces. Today, it will be wielded on the ice by Toronto’s hockey royalty. The color palette centers around a rich royal blue. The emblem combines the initials &#8220;T&#8221; and &#8220;S&#8221; to represent Toronto Sceptres, with the addition of a sceptre motif to evoke power, reflecting the team&#8217;s identity and spirit. The beveled edges add a sense of depth and solidity, enhancing its regal quality and imbuing it with a tangible, prestigious feel, evoking the team’s name and image.</blockquote><h3>Flower Shop provided text</h3>

<p>This one is probably my favorite of the bunch, at least for the shorthand version, with the cool “TS” monogram and its subtle chiseled design. I would have loved to see this without the black stroke but pretty much every logo in the roster has a stroke (or ten). The wordmark is fine but the lack of overshoot in the “S”s and the “C” is somewhat inexcusable.</p>

<p class="end">If I had to rank these, I would start with the Scepters as my favorite, followed by Victoire, and then it&#8217;s just a descending scale from “Fine” to “Bad” starting with Sirens, Fleet and Frost tied, and Charge dead last. Unfortunately the polls can only accommodate three categories, so you can&#8217;t vote on each logo. Overall, as summarized by the couple of merch images above, which are very generic and unify the team logos and colors into designs that look like they are sold at knock-off stores, the league has ways to go in terms of sophistication. It&#8217;s worth commending Flower Shop for designing six logos all at once and creating clearly distinctive visual approaches for each but all of the resulting logos feel underdeveloped and it might have been more beneficial to find six different designers/firms to each tackle one team at a time.</p>
