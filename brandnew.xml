                                            <p><strong>Relevant quote</strong><br /><em>The reimagined symbol in Piraeus’ rebranding transforms the three stripes to honor heritage and embrace a bold future, symbolizing Progress, Innovation, Reliability, and Openness. The custom logotype enhances visibility and underscores a modern approach.<br /><br />The new audio logo, created with Banjo Landscapes, reflects Piraeus’ values of closeness and humanity through tones of acoustic instruments like the piano and celesta. Its memorable rhythm, based on the Greek tribrach meter, aligns with the visual symbol’s three bars and the syllables in “Piraeus.” This ascending scale enhances the brand with a positive, open, and distinctive sonic identity.<br /><br />Piraeus Open is a bespoke typeface created in collaboration with Jordi Embodas. Available in two styles, Serif and Sans, it offers four weights and features 578 characters, enhancing the brand’s clarity and versatility. Designed for digital-first applications, Piraeus Open supports 56 languages. The Serif style conveys trust and serenity, while the Sans style offers readability and Mediterranean charm, making it ideal for digital interfaces.

                                            <p><strong>Opinion</strong><br />
                                            Not being familiar with this bank I wasn't sure what the meaning of the three stripes was but as <a href="https://logos.fandom.com/wiki/Piraeus_Bank" target="_blank">the bank's logo history reveals</a>, they are an abstraction of boat oars to represent, I assume, the importance of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piraeus" target="_blank">Piraeus</a> as a port city in Greece. Without that reference I was very confused by the old logo but now I can see some relative magic about it and its drastic minimalism but the execution wasn't particularly exciting. The new logo maintains the abstract stripes, now further removed from their oar origins, but slants them forward because progress and their spiky serifs pay off in the matching serifs of the wordmark. It's a nice logo but somehow un-bank-like. I don't know if the icon is missing a holding shape to make it more HSBC- or Chase-ish.<span></span> The identity has some nice elements, starting with the type family that spans not just serif and sans but but Latin and Greek alphabets, maintaining a really impressive consistency across the whole family and establishing a very strong foundation to build the identity around. The illustrations are a reminder of what made Corporate Memphis so popular to begin with as these are the very best examples of what the style has to offer but, unfortunately, its overuse can be blinding to anything good that might come out of it at this point. The identity also introduces a speech bubble motif with the spiky serifs of the logo translated into the little pointing bit of the bubble. It's a simple and not too overbearing design motif.<span></span> The color palette is quite nice too, with the taupe backgrounds accentuated by the muted yellow and deep blue/green. The layouts are all quite slick and well executed… I particularly like the ones with the blown-up icon interacting with the silhouetted illustrations. Overall, this is a very effective bank identity, looking serious and mature but also subtly playful and approachable to give clients some confidence that their money is in good hands but that it's also not in the hands of an evil financial behemoth.</p>

<blockquote>In terms of visual identity, the brand&#8217;s key elements have been updated to recreate the iconic look. The redesigned logo in a deep blue, recalling the brand&#8217;s name, is adapted to different points of contact. The packaging is enhanced by custom-made illustrations. Each one was painted in gouache by artist Florence Rivest, a clear nod to the recipe books of the 1960s and 1970s. In this way, grocery store packaging is easier to navigate, thanks to a strong brand identity.</blockquote><h3>LG2 provided text</h3>

<p>Like many vintage logos that made it to the 1980s and 1990s, Cordon Bleu&#8217;s otherwise nice script was ruined by placing it in a generic and ill-fitting ribbon shape with a poor gradient. I am guessing this is the result of the can&#8217;s design where the logo sat at the top with a swoosh separating it from the product photo. The new logo smartly gets rid of the ribbon and finesses the script mark in subtle yet very beneficial ways, mainly by thinning out the weight for a more streamlined look and better spacing within the many loops of the letters. The “or” and “on” pairs are now more defined and the “n” at the end, which at some point in its history connected directly to the “B”, has been shortened for a much less awkward finish on that first word. The logo can now stack in two lines too allowing it to appear bigger in the narrower structure of a can — I like how the “B” nestles in nicely in the open space of the “r”. Lastly, the logo (and overall identity) shifts from red to blue, which makes it look more premium and less like cheap soup.</p>

<p>The packaging is a huge improvement, going from a generic and I would even say off-putting — more like <em>off-poutine</em> though amirite? — look to something more high end and even artisanal. I&#8217;m not saying it&#8217;s luxurious by any means, because that wouldn&#8217;t be right, but compared to the old ones, the new cans look like a million bucks. With the new stacked configuration, the logo has enough size to stand on its own without the need of any extraneous swooshes or decoration and it works so well to accent the new, lovely illustrations that have such a cool, retro, 1950s-magazine-ad vibe. These are silhouetted on top of rounded-corner boxes in a range of colors with the product descriptions clearly presented in a bold sans serif, <a href="https://www.colophon-foundry.org/typefaces/midnight-sans" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Midnight Sans ST</a>, for the flavor and a retro rounded serif, <a href="https://www.myfonts.com/collections/roca-font-my-creative-land" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Roca Two</a>, for the category (whether it&#8217;s a sauce, a sauce helper, or a ready-to-eat meal). If I had one small criticism it might be the colors, which feel a little random and some of them not the most appetizing but I can see the benefit of strong color differentiation for easy spotting of each consumer&#8217;s can of choice on the shelves. In the end, it&#8217;s a strong and simple labeling system.</p>

<p>The additional tinge of nostalgia in the film-grain-y photography is great for the brand, giving it a comfort-food feel reminiscent of simpler, TV-dinner times. The one odd thing in the advertising samples shown is that there are two very different personalities going on… the first two examples with the blue backgrounds and sans serif type look generic and cheap but then the wild postings where the serif takes over along with the lifestyle photography and grainy gradients is way more interesting, enticing, and distinctive. In the social media images we get a glimpse at a “CB” monogram and while it&#8217;s probably as good as it gets when it comes to repurposing the initials in the primary logo, it feels a little unfinished and cobbled together. Nonetheless, show me enough stop-motion images of sandwiches being drenched in gravy and I&#8217;m good.</p>

<blockquote>Cordon Bleu, an enduring classic, stands out from the crowd with three 15-second animated spots, produced by LG2. Trop de choses sur le feu (Too much on the stove) is a campaign in line with the brand&#8217;s image makeover, and gives the impression viewers are diving right into the packaging. The skits, which many people can easily identify with, conclude with the new tagline Facile. Rapide. Savoureux. (Easy. Fast. Tasty).</blockquote><h3>LG2 provided text</h3>

<p class="end">While I don&#8217;t speak French, I get the gist of the TV spots, with various family members demanding different things and being noisy and selfish until a big can of Cordon Bleu shuts them up and feeds them. It&#8217;s a fun execution… although going with old school, clay stop-motion would have killed. Overall, a great redesign that hints at the nearly 100-year history and legacy of the brand with a retro and nostalgic look with a few contemporary accents.</p>

Rossi, who arrived in the US with just $25 in his pocket. He founded <a href="https://www.tropicana.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tropicana</a> with the mission of making the freshest juice available to everyone. As our business continues to grow, we have Anthony Rossi to thank for creating THAT innovative spirit and fresh thinking that continues at Tropicana today.&#8221;</p>

                                            <p><strong>Relevant quote</strong><br /><em>The new identity puts the orange back at the heart of the story. The evolved brand mark reintroduces the unique horizon arch with an orange punctuating the 'i.' Pairing this with 'The Original since 1947,' the brand mark now locks in the heritage story, infusing the brand with authenticity and a promise of superior quality. Tropicana’s iconic symbol, a whole orange with a red-and-white straw, has been enhanced to intensify taste appeal, whilst also establishing a more robust shape language to reinforce the brand's dedication to providing juice directly from the source.<br /><br />Final touches have been added to amplify Tropicana's craft and authenticity, including Anthony T. Rossi’s signature, a hand-drawn illustration of oranges, and a photograph of the original grove. These elements collectively elevate the brand, making sure Tropicana stands out as a beacon of quality, expertise, and deliciousness.<br /><br />Transformed from a generic commodity that blended into the clichés of the category to an iconic brand with unmissable standout, Tropicana now celebrates its unique difference – its unparalleled dedication to delivering delicious juice straight from the source. The design builds an emotional connection with consumers while ensuring consistency to revive the brand’s status as the Original Orange Juice.

                                            <p><strong>Opinion</strong><br />
                                            As noted in the title and introductory paragraph, one important distinction to make is that this logo and packaging only apply to the UK presence of Tropicana. The change doesn't extend <a href="https://www.tropicana.com/" target="_blank">to the U.S.</a>, where the logo is a kind of blend between the before and after in the UK. Even the hero orange is similar but ever so slightly different in the images below than <a href="https://www.tropicana.com/images/carousel/2048x1080_lockup.jpg" target="_blank">in the U.S. one</a>. Seems like it would be easy to consolidate assets and efforts but I guess not. Anyway… on to the change at hand. From the name alone the logo has plenty of equity and is relatively easily identifiable with the brand, to the point where you could have shown me all three logos — the before and after on this page and the U.S. version — and I would have told you they are all the correct version as they all fit the premise.<span></span> The new logo takes the old one and sets it on a slight curve with the biggest change being the tittle of the “i” that is converted into, naturally, an orange. It's somewhat clever and kind of surprising it hadn't happened before. It's also very fortuitous that the “i” falls smack in the middle (both in old and new logo). The addition of the text going in a circle around the wordmark is alright. There is a little bit of an odd tension with the descender of the “p” but it still works and the script “The” is actually quite pretty. Shame about the “T” that remains droopy.<span></span> The old packaging was not great but also par for the course for mainstream packaging. I am so used to the straw coming out of the full orange that seeing it coming out of a half open orange is almost upsetting. The new packaging is actually quite nice, with a lot of texture to it through the myriad treatments on it… there is the single-color orange pattern at the top, the logo, a combo of an Art Deco sans serif with a script for the descriptor, the hero orange, and a stipple-shaded circle underneath. It's a lot but it somehow works. In the none-orange flavors, a textured holding shape and an artisan-esque label <em>and</em> a typographic badge are added to the mix and, surprisingly, it all still works.<span></span> For the additional applications, all of the orange imagery looks quite nice and I really like the stipple illustration (as seen on the tote bag) but I wish the straw followed suit. There are also some funky type treatments for the headlines where they mix a light serif with a super wide bold sans serif that are relatively edgy, although for the life of me I can not parse the hero “It's THAT Juice” tagline as to what it means, how it reads, or what it's attempting to do. Overall, this does manage to feel like a breath of fresh air (or a squeeze of fresh oranges) for a mainstream brand that has always sort of passed unperceived without much personality and this provides some metaphorical pulp to its juice.</p>

Facing increased competition from streaming services, and the challenges of an ever-changing media landscape, Channel A recognized that their former slogan, “A Canvas that Holds Your Dreams,” and supporting brand identity, was no longer effectively communicating its meaning to both viewers and team members. Thus, Channel A recently partnered with Seoul, South Korea-based <a href="https://www.plus-ex.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Plus X</a> to develop a rebranding strategy that would reflect modern perspectives on technological innovation and media consumption while presenting a new vision for the brand internally and externally, and to refresh its brand identity to better resonate with both viewers and internal members.</p>

Channel A Growth Strategy Team Leader Kwak Jeong-ah said, “This rebranding is not a simple CI change, but rather focuses on maximizing the appropriate value as a content platform that keeps pace with the changing times.” She added, “This year, as we mark our 13th anniversary after 12 years, we are declaring a new beginning and will continue to move forward as the best content platform that communicates from the viewers’ perspective and provides continuous content experiences.”

The A-shaped symbol, created in the style of a Eulerian trail, reflects Channel A’s brand values of delivering boundless imagination and unparalleled enjoyment through endless content. Moving away from the previous vertical logo format that relies on the X and Y axes, the new Channel A logo is designed using the Z-axis extending upward and to the right, expressing Channel A’s progressive attitude of viewing the world from a three-dimensional perspective and striving to expand toward a broader horizon.

<p>The old logo was actually pretty great, both conceptually and in execution, as it reinforced the former brand slogan, “A Canvas that Holds Your Dreams,” by cleverly depicting a canvas on an easel. It also represented an &#8220;A,&#8221; with the word &#8220;Channel,&#8221; set in all-caps, serving as the crossbar. Many times, when a company decides to rebrand, it&#8217;s because the former identity becomes outdated, and in those situations, we can almost always find a ton of things about the old logo to nitpick apart, but I honestly don&#8217;t have anything negative to say about it. It was deceptively simple, and clearly communicated a top-level brand narrative. Perhaps it was a bit too bold and static for a company wanting to keep up with flashy streaming platforms, but I honestly think that some additional animated behaviors could have really brought it to life. Alas, the company wanted to move away from their former slogan (and I&#8217;m not entirely sure why), so it seems a canvas/easel mark would no longer be relevant.</p>

<p>Enter the new logo, which attempts to liven up the party with a title-case grotesk sans serif logotype with quirky humanist eccentricities — a modified <a href="https://www.grillitype.com/typeface/gt-america" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GT America</a> by <a href="https://www.grillitype.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Grilli Type,</a> which is also the primary brand typeface throughout — paired with a gradient abstract &#8220;A&#8221; logomark that is meant to suggest an endless stream of content being bounced all around.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s clear that Channel A and Plus X were trying to achieve a fun, friendly, and flashy mark with personality, and, for the most part, this checks those boxes, but… while I don&#8217;t <em>dislike</em> it — in fact, in isolation, I actually quite like it — I don&#8217;t necessarily think it&#8217;s <em>better</em> than its predecessor. Whereas the former logo felt bold and solid and timeless, this one feels trendy and very of-the-moment. Most times, in these reviews, we can compare the old and new logos and clearly see the effectiveness of the redesign, but since that&#8217;s not the case here, at least not to me, I&#8217;m really struggling with it. This may just be one of those times in which the old logo was so good, I wish I hadn&#8217;t seen it, since it&#8217;s clearly tainting my overall perception of the new one.</p>

<p>Anyway, the blue stroke of the logomark that ping-pongs and zips around in three-dimensional space becomes the main visual driver for the rest of this identity.</p>

<blockquote>
Today’s viewers actively consume content to improve their lives, not as passive but active participants. Channel A&#8217;s core sub-value of “Play” was chosen to reflect the modern viewer’s tendency to take control of what they see, interpret, and enjoy. Accordingly, Channel A redefined its essence as a platform for playing and creating content, helping viewers discover hidden joys in the world and broaden their horizons.
<br /><br />
These core values help internalize the new Channel A identity among its members, encouraging them to collectively explore diverse worlds, create new scenes, and expand personal potentials to build a better future.

<p>So this is the part that really confuses me about Channel A&#8217;s transformation. When I first started sorting the materials for this review, I initially got the impression that Channel A is a streaming platform. However, when digging deeper into my research, I learned that Channel A is a cable tv broadcaster. So I&#8217;m unclear about whether or not they&#8217;re pivoting to become a streaming platform or if they&#8217;re expanding their services to include aspects of streaming. Their core values and manifesto describe Channel A as &#8220;a content play and create platform…,&#8221; but what does that mean??? That sounds a bit like YouTube… right? Seriously, open the &#8220;Brand manifesto&#8221; image above in a new tab and read the small text. It&#8217;s all incredibly vague. Someone, anyone, especially if you&#8217;re South Korean and are familiar with Channel A, please help me out down in the comments.</p>

<blockquote>
Channel A’​​​​​​​s primary color, Channel A Blue, is the core design asset that forms the dynamic brand image of Channel A as a platform for playing and creating content, built on trust and integrity. The secondary colors, which complement the primary color, are derived from Channel A’s content and are used across various brand touchpoints based on the emotions felt from the content, emphasizing the diversity of IPs. The diverse colors within the color system extend into vibrant gradient patterns, expressing Channel A’s brand values of providing boundless imagination and unparalleled enjoyment through endless content.
<br /><br />
The newly defined Channel A brand identity speaks directly to the reward of “enjoyment” through content viewing and conveys a youthful and dynamic brand image through the bold expression “your world.”

<p>While I love the idea of an animated logomark as part of Channel A&#8217;s onscreen identity presence, I&#8217;m baffled by the rotation animation depicted here. Surely an animation of the stroke of the &#8220;A&#8221; zig-zagging and bouncing around would coincide better with the rest of the identity elements — and would be infinitely cooler to watch.</p>

</figure>

<p>The colors are bright and cheerful, and come to life through a system of background gradients derived from the aesthetics of the zig-zagging logomark. In static applications, these gradients are fine, but their energy intensifies satisfyingly when they&#8217;re animated — especially in the instances in which they emanate from the logomark. I love how they almost feel sprayed on and seem to expand as the digital &#8220;paint&#8221; soaks into the &#8220;paper.&#8221;</p>

<p>Adding to the identity toolkit are a series of obligatory 3D icons. They&#8217;re nicely constructed, but they feel out of place — at least in the few included applications that depict them in this review. It&#8217;s almost as if they were part of an earlier concept that someone just couldn&#8217;t let go of.</p>

<p>Channel A&#8217;s onscreen elements and motion behaviors are where this rebrand shines the most for me. The logomark suggests perpetual motion, and these dynamically animated assets deliver on that suggestion beautifully. The animation of the logomark&#8217;s stroke that bounces all around the screen to form the logo, and then dissolves into the animated background gradient is pure eye candy. I&#8217;ve watched it <em>so many times.</em></p>

<blockquote>
Channel A’s brand design applications use vibrant visuals to convey a dynamic brand image to both internal teams and the wider audience as a platform for playing and creating content. Various key visuals derived from the three-dimensional symbol are applied across different Channel A media, visually expressing the boundless expansion of infinite possibilities.

<p class="end">Overall, while I lament the former logo&#8217;s departure, and despite my nitpicks of some of the individual elements presented here, Plus X have delivered a topical, vibrant, and energetic brand identity that clearly signals some type of forward momentum in Channel A&#8217;s offering — whatever that may be.</p>
