                                            <p><strong>Opinion</strong><br />
                                            The old logo had a good thing going with its icon, which echoed (pun!) the 114 acoustical cubes that cover the walls and ceilings of the Orchestra Hall and that I originally described as exuding “magic fairy dust but the serious kind of magic fairy dust”, which makes me wonder what in the hell would be the <em>unserious</em> magic dust I was trying to refer to. (Also, I was a bit of a dick back then… apologies, ten years later, to the Capsule team for that note at the end of the opinion — I wasn't wrong but it was poorly delivered.) I still think the old wordmark was weird with its sharp edges.<span></span> The new logo abandons the icon in favor of a flexible set of wordmarks, all of which highlight the “O”, which is drawn to look like a musical <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whole_note" target="_blank">whole note</a>. To be honest I'm surprised more symph*O*nies and *O*rchestras haven't used this before or that we don't see it more often. With one “O” in each word of the name, it's just the right amount of “O”s — there is a town near where I live called Loogootee, IN, and <em>that</em> would be too many “O”s if they had a world-class orchestra with a logo like this. Wedged in between a simple sans serif, the “O”s stand out nicely but, for some odd reason, they also decided to give the “R”s some extra flair and it was an unnecessary flex as it becomes distracting from the primary visual hook. I'm also not sure the super sharp ink traps were necessary on the “M” and “N”. The “MN—O” shorthand logo is pretty nice (but said ink traps stand out even more here) and I do like how it can expand in application with each letter going to a corner of the canvas. The “MINN — ORCH” logos are less effective and start to get a bit silly when placed on a curve.<span></span> The few applications shown are alright… the color palette of blue, brown, and yellow is quite nice and the typography is mostly okay but the abundance of tilted “O”s in the headlines is maybe too heavy-handed. The instances of headlines on a curve are charming and the holding shapes add some welcome texture to the identity. Overall, some hiccups along the way but the identity has an elegant playfulness to it that should serve the orchestra well.</p>

Launched in 2015 by Shav Garg, Connor Lawrence, and Matt Pavia as an artist-discovery platform with a proprietary algorithm that identifies artists poised for breakout success, the company has evolved into a matchmaker marketplace of sorts where that same algorithm now provides transparent information about both artist and partner performance to allow both parties to find the best match, form partnerships per release efficiently and equitably, and administer royalty payments all while maintaining a priority on the artists&#8217; best interests by ensuring that artists own their masters, always get 50% or more of profits post-recoupment, and keep creative control. Recently, Indify introduced a new identity designed by Brooklyn, NY-based <a href="https://center.design/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CENTER</a>.</p>

<blockquote>Leading with a six pointed star as the logo mark, we helped Indify level up with a brand system that has two functions. It must build trust with its network of investors and artists as a cutting-edge tech platform using data to pinpoint, project, and pump up emerging artists. But it’s also artist-led and avant-garde, meaning it must also resonate with and represent our artist partners—creative souls who have left “the real world” to follow their passion, vision, and expressive voice. Through analog textures and hazy, layered animations it emphasizes the grainy, colorful dream state of stardom.</blockquote><h3>CENTER provided text</h3>

<figcaption>Logo animation.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The old logo was mostly fine with an icon that was somewhere between a pulse and a music wave plus a basic sans serif wordmark but both elements could have been executed better, especially the wordmark in <a href="https://fonts.adobe.com/fonts/proxima-nova" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Proxima Nova</a>, which was very poorly spaced and the use of its rounded alternate “y” felt out of place. The new logo is far more exciting and engaging with a spark icon built with some uncommon proportions and a fun perspective as revealed in the logo animation. (It might be a little reminiscent <a href="https://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/new_logo_and_identity_for_eurostar_group_by_designstudio.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">of Eurostar&#8217;s icon</a> but I do think they are different enough that Indify&#8217;s can be given the benefit of the doubt as being conceived independently.) The wordmark has a cool, blunt presence and somehow gives me skater culture vibes, which is not a bad association for indie music. In another case of reminiscence, the wordmark might be too similar to that in another CENTER project, <a href="https://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/new_logo_identity_and_packaging_for_butter_by_center.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Butter</a>, with the extended sans serif and this one also seems to be using <a href="https://mckltype.com/owners" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Owners Wide</a> but customized. Nonetheless, it&#8217;s a cool logo and the all-red composition is very rare to see nowadays and looks kind of bad-ass.</p>

<p>My absolute favorite element of the identity is the various spark animations. The color combinations are so wrong they are absolutely right. The blurry gradient motion is hypnotic and the resulting compositions as various sparks overlap are incredibly unique. Unfortunately, at least for now, they are not used as much in the applications shown here, on their website, or their Instagram account so hopefully they&#8217;ll show up more in the future.</p>

<p>Not a whole lot in application beyond the website and social media content. To a degree, it&#8217;s almost a non-identity, with artist photography and video playing a larger role with deadpan sans serif typography supporting it, which is not a wrong approach but that is maybe missing some amount of flair and/or personality to give Indify a stronger brand voice. The red color does work well in this regard and it looks great when used on top of the artist imagery.</p>

<p class="end">Although I would have loved to see more of the logo-on-sidewalk energy throughout the applications or a more experimental approach to integrating the funky spark animations/compositions I understand why the identity is pared down and in deference to the artists&#8217; imagery but maybe it takes a little too much of a backseat. Overall, this does have an indie feel that should help small artists feel comfortable with Indify&#8217;s offering and I also like how it&#8217;s an antidote visually to Spotify&#8217;s green and philosophically to its corporate-first, artist second model.</p>

                                            <p><strong>Relevant quote</strong><br /><em>The new branding is the result of extensive customer research and listening to understand how customers see Asda, what they love, and how the supermarket needs to regain its relevance and individuality in the market. Asda’s light-hearted, northern, humour and warmth – along with its iconic green - were consistently shared as the most unique traits of the brand and are reflected in its logo, typography and colour palette - adding a new dark green tone to the renowned Asda green. The new identity also features ‘stickers’ to allow the supermarket to showcase its range of offers and ranges in a creatively consistent way – with added personality.

                                            <p><strong>Opinion</strong><br />
                                            Not being as familiar with ASDA as our UK-based readers, I have no strong feelings or associations towards the old logo… for a grocery store it's far too dry and looks more like some of kind Big Agriculture corporation. Putting an oval around it literally softens it and the new green on green combo is more interesting but it's still a fairly lackluster logo. From both logos I also get the impression of a no-frills grocery shopping experience and that cost savings trump quality, which is a perfectly acceptable positioning business- and design-wise for a grocer and both logos support that.<span></span> The bigger move in this identity is the introduction of a new type family designed by <a href="https://www.colophon-foundry.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Colophon Foundry</a> that spans three styles: Display, Subline, and Text, showcasing varying degrees of fun-ness as the typography spans headlines, subheadlines, and body copy all using the same design DNA. The Display version comes only in unicase and it is quite good. In contrast <a href="https://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/new_logo_and_identity_for_air_up_by_mother_design.php" target="_blank">to another recent custom unicase</a>, this one solves the “a” and “e” perfectly by making them a little narrower so that they don't feel humongous. The numerals in the Display version are amazing and the British Pound sign is one of the most delightful glyphs of 2024. As noted <a href="https://www.itsnicethat.com/articles/havas-asda-graphic-design-160524" target="_blank">in the It's Nice That story</a>, these take a cue from hand-painted grocer signage, which really comes through in the numerals.<span></span> The identity also introduces a bevy of stickers that, unlike some other projects where the sticker motif is gratuitous, makes perfect sense here. While it certainly works for the general consumer, here on Brand New it may feel like they are a few years too late on the trend but if any industry gets to use it, it's grocers. The stickers themselves are fun and energetic thanks to the new color palette and typography. I'm actually more entertained by the price tags, with their red and white combo and subtle arrows… I kind of would have loved to see that become more embedded into the communications. Speaking of which, there is some clever copywriting and satisfying puns throughout — “Romaine calm” makes me jealous. Overall, the identity is visually lively and verbally engaging with neither aspect feeling like it's trying too hard to be something that the ASDA brand is not — it’s appealing and attractive in a simple and approachable way.</p>

The wordmark is pretty unique, with its small caps, chunky serifs, and exaggerated internally-rounded ligatures. It feels sort of like a high-end fashion magazine logo that spent a lot of time hanging out at a western saloon in the 1800s. While mixed case wordmarks can often feel a little goofy, the choice in this case to use lowercase “l”s that extend to the cap line actually has the opposite effect—the result is a rather elegant, unexpected variable cadence across the top of the mark with the added benefit of nullifying the inevitably awkward kerning issues that would have arisen with the presence of so many uppercase “L”s. Additionally, the hyper-elongated cap height accentuates the shortness of the rest of the letters, creating a subtle nod to the petite stature of the brand’s clientele.

The flower icon is notably less unique, but is beautiful nonetheless and has a similar timeless, vintage feel that elegantly complements the wordmark. I’m curious about the decision-making behind the scenes to put it in an oval/squircle rather than a true circle (since they ultimately end up using a circular version on the button of the jeans), but also, who cares? It’s pretty. The shorthand stacked lock-up is pretty satisfying and while there’s a part of me whose eye is twitching because the left and right edges don’t align perfectly, I can mostly appreciate the simplicity of just letting it be what it is without forcing it into a perfect box.

The rest of the identity elements — photography, color, typography, a tiny tidbit of additional illustration — feel perfectly aligned and completely effortless, with <a href="https://www.colophon-foundry.org/typefaces/basis-grotesque" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Colophon’s Basis Grotesque</a> and <a href="https://www.colophon-foundry.org/typefaces/basis-grotesque-mono" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Basis Grotesque Mono</a> serving as the meat of the typographical system. (While personally, I am somehow not sick of the all-caps-monospace-as-subhead approach yet— I love the hyper-utilitarian feel that balances between modern and retro, technical and manual— I do find myself wondering when this treatment is going to start to look dated and read as a hallmark of the 2020s.) The script font—10 points to Gryffindor to whomever can identify it— is a lovely elegant addition and I wish we saw a smidge more of it (unfortunately it doesn’t seem to have made the final cut, having been replaced by the still nice, but notably less elegant <a href="https://www.jukeboxfonts.com/products/annabelle?variant=19701635271" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Annabelle JF</a> on the <a href="https://nelleatelier.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">website</a>).

Everything really comes together when we get to the product itself, with a special shoutout to the wordmark translating beautifully to small-scale embroidery. Not much to say about the e-commerce experience except that it is perfectly pleasant and appropriate, and does a good job of letting the product shine using authentic, diverse models, simple functionality, and a lot of white space.

While I find myself wishing there was a little more to look at, there is something to be said for an identity that can do so much with so little— ultimately, Nelle has exactly what it needs to be successful, serving as welcome proof that not every brand needs an audio logo and a motion identity and three proprietary fonts and a custom AI-image generator to be effective. I’d even go as far as to bet that this simple, timeless identity will outlast many of the suped-up, feature-rich rebrands we’ve witnessed lately, and for the sake of short-statured ladies everywhere, I hope I’m right.
