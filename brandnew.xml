                                            <p><strong>Relevant quote</strong><br /><em>At the core of the identity system is the custom typeface, derived from Phillips's iconic logo, offering expressive power in display weight and functional utility in text weight. Following a 3-tier logic, the system allows Phillips to present itself in various ways, maintaining a recognizable and contemporary identity. The charismatic, bold, and modern identity stands in stark contrast to the more conservative landscape of traditional competitors, reinforcing Phillips as a brand synonymous with modernity and imagination. This adaptable identity system mirrors Phillips's dynamic offerings and innovative spirit, positioning the brand as a leader in unique auction experiences.

                                            <p><strong>Opinion</strong><br />
                                            With such a nice wordmark, it's understandable why and how this identity doubles down on it and introduces a type family — with a display and a text version — that builds on it. It's wide but not too wide, light but not too light, hip but not too hip, deadpan but not completely dead, and has low-hanging crossbars but not so low as to look Art Deco. It's not the coolest or most unique of typefaces but it's definitely nice and it has some elegance to it but without it being uppity. The numerals are pretty nice too. I wish there were some actual type specimens created/provided to better experience its details instead of the long video. While I appreciate the core ingredient of the identity, I'm unsure about its application.<span></span> I understand that the premise is that, through the single typeface, the identity can flex in different ways and styles to evoke a particular artistic movement or reflect the peculiarities of an artist but, in scrolling through all the applications, it all feels disconnected and like it's trying too hard to be cool or clever or high-brow. There is also something off about the typesetting, where everything is set too tightly but then the logo is so loose and, because it's the same typeface, there is a weird relationship… if you look at the ad with the top-hat-wearing person, it's almost as if each type block is doing its own thing. There also seems to be a purposeful integration of wacky display typefaces, which could have been interesting but right now it's neither here nor there, making random appearances. Overall, everything is fine and there is a solid foundation to build on through the custom typeface but, so far, it's a lot of different treatments and styles all vying to be the top bidder but coming up short.</p>

<h1 class="friday_likes">Dirty Vegan by Jens Nilsson</h1>
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/friday_likes_dirtyvegan.jpg" alt="Dirty Vegan by Jens Nilsson" />

<p style="margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;"><a href="https://www.instagram.com/dirtyvegan.se" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dirty Vegan</a> was a vegan restaurant in Stockholm, Sweden, serving junk and comfort food — burgers, sloppy joes, burritos, pancakes, and more — instead of the traditional healthy options at vegan establishments. I usually don&#8217;t cover businesses that don&#8217;t exist or have closed but this case study, showcasing so many great REAL applications, is very much worth making an exception. The identity, designed by local designer <a href="https://www.jens-nilsson.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jens Nilsson</a>, set the tone that this wasn&#8217;t your typical vegan place by adopting more of a shady nightclub (bordering on strip club) vibe with a tantalizing lip-licking mouth icon and a purple, red, and black color palette that avoided any possible shade of the more typical greens for the category. To add to the quirkiness and oddity, the identity combined the slanted and back-slanted styles of <a href="https://goodtypefoundry.com/adieu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Adieu</a> to typeset some fun and off-beat copywriting. The applications all look great in a striking balance of upscale production techniques with low-brow-ish materials. Needless to say, that neon sign rocked — hope someone kept it. <span class="pagination_divider"></span><span class="small_caps"><a href="https://www.jens-nilsson.com/work/dirty-vegan" target="_blank" rel="noopener">See full project</a></span></p>

<h1 class="friday_likes">Studley Park Boathouse by Studio Sly</h1>
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/friday_likes_studleypark.jpg" alt="Studley Park Boathouse by Studio Sly" />

<p style="margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;"><a href="https://studleyparkboathousekew.com.au/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Studley Park Boathouse</a> is an actual working boathouse located on the shore of the Yarra River as it crosses Melbourne, Australia. Established in 1863 it is the oldest continually operating public boathouse in the area that has been operated by different owners over the decades (and centuries). After a recent transformation, it now offers a range of new spaces and dining options. The identity, designed by local firm <a href="https://studiosly.com.au/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Studio Sly</a>, brings a chill, sailor-esque vibe with a simple series of striped backgrounds in a lovely green color. The primary logo mixes some minimalist oars with the initials of the establishment for an upscale yet relaxed look. For the full wordmark and for use in the identity, a very unique slab serif adds some flair. Originally designed for <a href="https://bpando.org/2019/10/18/branding-freadman-white/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Freadman White</a>, Frisky Freadman by Dennis Grauel, is such a perfect fit for the boathouse vibes while a monospace typeface adds a touch of 21st-century designer hipness. Imagine a perfect day on the river with that takeout pizza box and cup to go on a charming little boat. I&#8217;ll pass because I don&#8217;t like tiny boats but that sounds nice. <span class="pagination_divider"></span><span class="small_caps"><a href="https://www.behance.net/gallery/182345233/Studley-Park-Boathouse" target="_blank" rel="noopener">See full project</a></span>

<h1 class="friday_likes">Ashton by LG2</h1>
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/friday_likes_ashton.jpg" alt="Ashton by LG2" />

<p style="margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:30px!important;"><a href="https://ashtonrestaurants.ca/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ashton</a> is a fast food chain in Canada with 23 locations serving hot dogs, burgers, roast beef sandwiches, and poutine. The latter is notorious for Ashton as its original founder, Ashton Leblond, is credited for being the first to bring poutine to Quebec City in 1969 when he opened a roadside trailer. After a recent ownership change, Ashton introduced a new identity designed by <a href="https://lg2.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LG2</a> that exudes nostalgia and comfort at all turns, starting with its bold, rounded serif wordmark whose letters fit so delightfully snug together and with each other… as tight and chompy as some curds held together with gravy. The red and white color palette gives old school diner effortlessly and the new interior design, also by LG2, transports patrons to the 1960s but with a slick, contemporary execution. <a href="https://boutique.gestock.ca/bienvenue-sur-la-boutique" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Some fun merch</a> seals the deal. <span class="pagination_divider"></span><span class="small_caps"><a href="https://lg2.com/en/our-work/refreshing-a-brand-with-a-proud-heritage" target="_blank" rel="noopener">See full project</a></span></p>

                                            <p><strong>Relevant quote</strong><br /><em>Playful and maverick, we created a new purpose to make elite sport accessible to new communities, cultures and generations – reengineering Slazenger as a brand at the top of its game, not past its prime. We built a new brand expression championing what people already know and love about Slazenger: its iconic yellow ball.<br /><br />Working with their in-house product design team, we developed a product architecture for the most accessible and elite ends of its range, heroed its signature neon yellow, and optimised the famous cat logotype for the next generation. Throughout its history, Slazenger has named its products around the idea: ‘Challenge’ – so we brought this to life through messaging that celebrates British innovation, disrupts tradition and drives community. A bright new future for Slazenger and British sport.

                                            <p><strong>Opinion</strong><br />
                                            Starting in the 1960s, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=1260079137378047" target="_blank">Slazenger has had a panther as its logo</a> and I'm sure there is a reason for the choice but I couldn't find one so we'll assume that it's not just meaningful to the brand but that there is a lot of equity built into it. In its previous iteration, the panther drawing was pretty terrible, with deformed front and back limbs, a super thin tail, and an awkwardly agape mouth. Capturing an animal in motion for a logo is no easy feat but the old one failed miserably. The new panther — I love that the design quote calls it a “cat” — is a vast improvement and it's abstracted in most of the right places. The head is particularly successful with the tiny ears and strong jaw line. The front and hind legs are just a tad weird… I think it might be the lack of a puffed up chest where both the front and back of the panther are almost symmetrical. Still, an improvement, and placing it inside a yellow tennis ball makes it look more iconic.<span></span> The old wordmark was groovy in its vintage aesthetic and I wish they had leaned into that vibe with a contemporary twist somehow instead of the overly corporate-looking sans serif that has some really weird proportions… like, the “e”s and “n” are tiny compared to the “a” and “g”. It's just not very interesting. The identity and few sample applications shown go into a number of directions, starting with the tennis ball illustrations that are actually cool and clever but hard to tell when, how, or where they appear. For headlines, the sans serif switches into a very tightly typeset italic, which could have been potentially cool with a more vintage typeface but the one selected doesn't feel at ease with so little spacing.<span></span> Not shown above but making appearances on the website and on social media <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C84Ii0KsEBH/" target="_blank">is a condensed serif</a>, which is different from everything else altogether and starts to lean into the much more successfully executed territory of <a href="https://www.vacation.inc/" target="_blank">Vacation</a> — not that they compete for the same audience or market so that might be a moot point. The couple samples of photography are both completely different. I actually like the clay-court-like photos with the accents of yellow. Overall, it's hard to tell exactly what vibe this brand wants to exude — vintage? performance? lifestyle? — and for what audience with a lack of cohesiveness not just in the above examples but even between their website and social media… it's bouncing all over the place like an endless rally.</p>

<blockquote>A global leader not only in payment devices but also in payment systems, Verifone has grown through acquisitions to encompass e-commerce and many other payment-related services. As the payment architects shaping ecosystems for an ever-evolving world of commerce, their redesigned identity is now centered around the visual idea of interconnected modularity, which feels physically tangible and emphasizes the digital to create an engaging omni-commerce experience. With interconnected dots at the core, everything from the logotype to the typeface was redesigned and shaped into a flexible, visually striking system: fluid shapes, conceptual pictograms, interactive icons, and digital design. This created a fully immersive identity, ensuring brand consistency and relevant standout across all channels, and providing endless variation potential that serves Verifone’s physical devices, digital products, services, and environments.</blockquote><h3><a href="https://nordid.se/case/verifone/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NORD ID project page</a></h3>

<p>The old logo — <a href="https://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/new_logo_and_identity_for_verifone_by_desantis_breindel.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Noted on Brand New in 2015</a> — was relatively decent with a distinctive treatment for its initial and somewhat pleasant degree of italic. The curvy bottoms of the letters, especially of the “e”s, were a little cringy but at least they tied back to the bottom of the “V” where it broke off for the blue stroke. The new logo abandons all references to it and establishes a whole new personality through a more techie look, starting with the icon-slash-abstract-“V”-monogram. It&#8217;s an eye-catching graphic and the gooey connection between the two dots is kind of satisfying visually while conceptually conveying the idea of connecting the various stops needed to complete a transaction. The <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=liquid+mercury&#038;sca_esv=8d785069c21da656&#038;sca_upv=1&#038;udm=2&#038;biw=1762&#038;bih=1149&#038;sxsrf=ADLYWIKMROAw4b2Cpp1jjTB2RPpYUmpP0g%3A1720692657943&#038;ei=sa-PZvWpOY6IptQPvsm-6AQ&#038;ved=0ahUKEwi1xpPV356HAxUOhIkEHb6kD00Q4dUDCBA&#038;uact=5&#038;oq=liquid+mercury&#038;gs_lp=Egxnd3Mtd2l6LXNlcnAiDmxpcXVpZCBtZXJjdXJ5MggQABiABBixAzIFEAAYgAQyBRAAGIAEMgUQABiABDIFEAAYgAQyBRAAGIAEMgUQABiABDIFEAAYgAQyBRAAGIAEMgUQABiABEjztQFQjqoBWIK0AXABeACQAQCYAb8CoAHXB6oBBzYuMC4xLjG4AQPIAQD4AQGYAgigApkGwgINEAAYgAQYsQMYQxiKBcICBhAAGAcYHpgDAIgGAZIHBTcuMy0xoAedKg&#038;sclient=gws-wiz-serp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">liquid mercury-like</a> animation of it is pretty cool too.</p>

<p>The wordmark is nicely executed and the subtle ink swells in the “r” and “n” tie well with the icon while the horizontal strokes on the “r” and “f” add some personality. I think a slab-y, monospace-y “i” would have been beneficial here as the regular “i” ends up feeling a little squished. The lock-up and size relationship between icon and wordmark is also a bit off, with the icon looking too big… perhaps 75% of the current size would do. Nonetheless, a solid logo that looks contemporary and technologically-infused — not to mention that it is eon light years away, in a good way, from Verifone&#8217;s original logo.</p>

<p>For the identity, a custom typeface has been designed, although not much information or samples of it are provided but from browsing Verifone&#8217;s website, you can get a pretty good sense of it. It&#8217;s an extension of the wordmark and it looks good at big and small sizes. The short ascenders and descenders give it some extra personality. Another recurring element are some 3D molecules that look as if you were peering through a microscope into some organic matter and it&#8217;s a slightly odd direction to go in as it definitely feels more medical than fintech-nical. It certainly ties to the icon in the logo but the slow movement and the blue-ish-green color don&#8217;t quite indicate financial transactions at the speed of light. I would have loved to see more of the icon animation energy and the bright mint and black color combo to provide a more electrifying sense of motion. A hint of That Blue is also added into the mix, which works fairly okay in the website as a UI accent but then rendering the molecules in it starts to get confusing as to which is the hero color.</p>

<p class="end">Not a whole lot in actual application. The one image with all the various things looks cool and convincing — even with the floppy disks — and there is a good mix of elements in there, from the big model numbers to the floods of mint color. The Instagram posts look good too but then the Instagram stories take a weird turn with the animated typography where letters rain down, or form into a smile, or are skewed to match the angle of a device… it&#8217;s like a whole other project. Overall, this has maybe one or two design tricks too many but it&#8217;s still a mostly cohesive identity that presents Verifone with a more confident presence and one that seems geared to gain more enterprise clients, which is probably where the money is but that perhaps now feels a little too slick and alienating for small businesses where a more consumer brand approach could have been beneficial.</p>
