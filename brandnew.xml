From bidet showers to toilet stools – they are all about the ass. The new brand we designed for them is all about breaking the taboo: The bold typography mimics the body’s natural curves, the colours create a warm atmosphere and easily applicable elements like the splash and butthole serve as the cherry on the top. If this doesn’t help to spread some love, what will?

                                            <p><strong>Opinion</strong><br />
                                            The old logo was arguably fine, conveying a sense of simplicity and clinical cleanliness with its water droplet icon, light weight rounded sans serif, and overly polite color palette. The old packaging was also quite soft-spoken and literally trying not to call attention to itself as if it were ashamed of the category it lived in. Every element of this new iteration of the brand takes the complete opposite approach of what it had been doing before, starting with the logo. The minimalist water droplet icon has evolved into a plump buttock that will have you reaching for that 🍑 emoji and the wordmark abandons all politeness in favor of an in-your-face, heavily condensed serif. (<a href="https://kilotype.de/families/queens" target="_blank">Queens</a>, used throughout the identity, looks like it was also used as the basis for the wordmark before being squeezed and rounded-cornered.) I'm not sure I can say I like either element based on their execution or even their aesthetic but the energy feels right as well as being fun, lively, and surprising… like a splash of fresh water up your butthole.<span></span> The identity doesn't stop there and goes full in on some lowbrow humor, at first with some headline typography where the counterspaces of the letters are drawn to look like an anus and if they are not meant to be drawn like that then I apologize, dear reader, for having my mind in the gutter. When not anus-ed, the typography, using <a href="https://typeverything.com/graf" target="_blank">Graf Rounded</a>, is just plain fun if, at times, <a href="https://bidetlity.de/en/pages/about-us" target="_blank">exhausting to read</a>. The icon is used as a pattern but when it flops unto the screen in some of the animations it starts to look a little more like a scrotum, which I guess needs a fine splash of water every now and then but is perhaps a little off-putting. The color palette is… interesting. I like the purple and mint pastels and the bright orange is a nice spark but the red-ish brown, well, we all know what it reminds us of. Aside from its possible interpretations, its darkness and saturation are at odds with the rest of the colors.<span></span> The packaging looks pretty good and is a big improvement over the old one that looked more like a dental hygiene product. The tone of voice is unapologetic and doesn't pull any punches when it comes to mentioning butts, poop, and holes of different kinds, which I don't have a problem with but it perhaps lacks some cohesion in terms of headline structure and how flippant or aggressive or charming it wants to be. Overall, this is undoubtedly memorable and the brand embraces its market niche with humor and personality so that we may all benefit from a cleaner, fresher, and happier butthole — amidst the chaos of the world, this feels like an attainable, rewarding goal.

                                            <p>From ornate to minimalist to playful, a fun range of projects this week with work from Paris, Buenos Aires, and Lima.</p>

<h1 class="friday_likes">VNV by Violaine &amp; Jérémy</h1>
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/friday_likes_vnv.jpg" alt="VNV by Violaine &amp; Jérémy" />

<p style="margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;"><a href="https://www.instagram.com/vnvpatisserie/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">VNV Pâtisserie et Chocolaterie</a> is a high-end, reservation-only, pastry and chocolate establishment founded by Valda Chang and Vincent Pelte that brings French traditions to Taiwan. The identity, designed by Paris, France-based <a href="https://www.behance.net/violaineetjeremy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Violaine &amp; Jérémy</a>, is as indulgently delicious as VNV&#8217;s creations, featuring twelve different hand-drawn “VV” monograms, an ornate custom alphabet to serve as moulds for chocolates, some detailed ornaments and borders, and a hero pineapple illustration, all in a luscious eighteenth-century French aesthetic. As usual, the attention to detail in the production of all the applications is stunning and the tight color palette of a muted mint, a dark green, a lime-ish green, and gold foil is a beautiful contrast to the dark brown inventions of the two founders. The supporting typography and fun copywriting is yet another tasty morsel in an already decadent project. <span class="pagination_divider"></span><span class="small_caps"><a href="https://www.behance.net/gallery/221811585/VNV-Patisserie-chocolaterie" target="_blank" rel="noopener">See full project</a></span></p>

<h1 class="friday_likes">Palito by Ariel Chiesa</h1>
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/friday_likes_palito.jpg" alt="Palito by Ariel Chiesa" />

<p style="margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;"><a href="https://www.palito.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Palito</a> is a stylish, single toothpick costing $85. What do you get for that price? A toothpick that is “Crafted with neurotic precision and an unwavering commitment
to detail” available in a range of premium woods… or well, <em>not</em> available as they are sold out. The identity, designed by Buenos Aires, Argentina-based <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/arielchiesa/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ariel Chiesa</a>, gives the product a playful, charming, and rustic charm that helps offset the arguably ridiculous premise of the product and that, with the wrong design, could have easily been the douchiest, eye-rolling-est luxury product. In tandem with what is clearly the loveliest toothpick ever created, the packaging, typographic choices, paper selection, letterpress printing, and clear instructions on what to do and not to do with the toothpick really forces you to consider making an investment in this everyday object you can easily own for, like, 1 cent. <span class="pagination_divider"></span><span class="small_caps"><a href="https://the-brandidentity.com/project/blending-sophistication-and-playful-irreverence-palitos-toothpicks-are-made-to-be-design-objects" target="_blank" rel="noopener">See full project</a></span>

<h1 class="friday_likes">Antonieta by Estudio Paloma</h1>
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/friday_likes_antonieta.jpg" alt="Antonieta by Estudio Paloma" />

<p style="margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:30px!important;"><a href="https://www.instagram.com/estoes.antonieta/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Antonieta</a> is a catering bakery in Lima, Peru, offering cakes, cookies, and more, all with an extra colorful and vibrant layer of fondant-infused decorations. The identity, designed by local firm <a href="https://estudiopaloma.pe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Estudio Paloma</a>, takes an effortless cue from the tasty offerings with an exuberant script wordmark that looks like it was squeezed out of a piping bag with thick, gooey connections and supported by a system of colorful wavy graphics that are layered to yield some fun patterns, all in a vibrant palette of pink, yellow, green, and blue. <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1cjuAFcx4ZxbRSE0xA8bRL1svkNA0GuBj/view" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Their ordering brochure is also worth a look</a> as all of the wacky elements come together in a more formal way and some super fun cake, cookie, macaron, and cupcake diagrams help customers make the right choice, which, honestly, doesn&#8217;t look like there is a wrong choice to begin with. <span class="pagination_divider"></span><span class="small_caps"><a href="https://www.behance.net/gallery/191621225/ANTONIETA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">See full project</a></span></p>

The name reflects two defining qualities of stars: light and direction. Our wordmark’s lowercase ‘a’ letterforms are inspired by the Sanskrit script for the sound “Ta,” grounding our identity in this rich linguistic heritage.<br /><br />Our wordmark also draws from late modernist typography, including the NASA worm logo (1975) and Wim Crouwel’s New Alphabet (1967). Both examples embody universality through reductive forms. Crouwel’s work, influenced by the constraints of early display technology, is especially relevant—echoing the way our terminals and chips use lenses and receivers to perceive the world.<br /><br />Our icon directly reflects the meaning of Taara in Sanskrit: “star.” It represents both the sun and the role of stars in navigation, symbolizing guidance and connection.<br /><br />Beyond its celestial meaning, the icon also evokes the light-based technology in our products—from lighthouses aiding communication to the lenses and apertures in our systems and the way photons appear when captured holographically.<br /><br />The joined forms in our icon reflect how our technology enables point-to-point data transmission, bridging gaps and extending networks. In rare instances, the mark may be multiplied to symbolize amplification and abundance—reinforcing the scalability and power of our technology.

                                            <p><strong>Opinion</strong><br />
                                            The old logo — <em>if</em> I have it correct and <em>if</em> it actually saw the light of day in any way (as there wasn't any kind of official, standalone, online presence for Taara before 2025) — was fine for the most part and if the star icon had been a little thinner to visually match the weight of the wordmark, it would have been solid. The new logo is literally and metaphorically rad(ical) — metaphorically in that I kind of love it and literally in that it takes a risk in cropping the “a”s in an unconventional way. The latter, though, is cleverly rationalized by the “a”s being inspired <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E0%A4%A4" target="_blank">by the letter “त”</a> — which is pronounced as “ta” — in Devanagari, which is the most common script used to write Sanskrit, which, as explained in the design quote above, is the language where the name of company comes from, meaning “star”. Complicated way of saying this is a conceptually- and visually-sound logo that eschews most tech brand trends and offers something refreshingly original.<span></span> A double-star icon serves as a separate, supporting element and while it's a slick little drawing it doesn't quite make an impression… like, it's a nice detail but as far as operating as an identifier for the company, it may be too fragile. Still, it's a great sign-off in some of the applications like the business card or report. Speaking of which, the applications are all fairly straightforward, using <a href="https://www.schick-toikka.com/lateral" target="_blank">Lateral</a> as the main typeface in support of some strong photography and imagery that takes advantage of both the sci-fi-ish nature of the product and the landscapes of the remote locations where the product is the most beneficial, to yield an intriguing moody, techie, rural-y vibe. The copywriting is solid and I like how it's just very factual and clear where it could have easily taken a more savior-y tone. Overall, a smart-looking and smart-sounding identity that helps present an overly complex technology in a simple, efficient, and effective manner.</p>

Through a dynamic visual system, the campaign interweaves historical moments, pioneering products, and the human ingenuity that has driven Microsoft forward.
<br></br>
Artifacts—both past and present—form the foundation of this campaign’s visual system. From early versions of Windows and the rise of Xbox to today’s AI-powered Copilot, these elements tell the story of Microsoft’s impact across industries and cultures. Each artifact is carefully curated to reflect the diverse ways in which Microsoft technology has intersected with people’s lives over the last five decades.
<br></br>
The campaign’s 50th-anniversary logo—and main campaign artifact—reinforces this legacy. A nod to the original Windows logo—the first truly mainstream Microsoft brand—it embraces a retro feel while evolving through motion and 3D to remain firmly rooted in the present.

<p>
The 50th anniversary logo takes the early Windows logos of the ’90s and Minecraft-ifies* it into a pixelated floating monolith, taking some liberties with the “window panes” to turn them into a “5” and a “0’. The Windows logo has never been a beacon of great design and I can’t say that this iteration changes that for me, but it does certainly evoke ’90s internet. Unfortunately, the color palette and treatment also evokes (major competitor) Google to a certain extent, to the point where if I saw this in a vacuum, I might think I had entered a time machine and believe it was Google’s 50th anniversary we were celebrating. All that said, it’s an interesting take, and the motion treatment is rather mesmerizing.

<p>
The broad assortment of “artifacts” here, particularly when put into motion together in their amorphous “worlds,” evoke a sense of randomized y2k chaos that seems right for the melding of past-present-future they’re going for. Given that Microsoft unwittingly helped forge the ’90s and 2000s aesthetic that has since come back to haunt us all with a drop shadowed, chrome, rainbow vengeance, it seems only natural that said aesthetic should play such an integral role in a celebration of the company’s past. Kudos to Koto here for capitalizing on such a unique opportunity and not cowing to corporate blandness— I don’t think we’ve seen anything this edgy from Microsoft since its short-lived but absolutely METAL <a href="https://blog.logomaster.ai/hs-fs/hubfs/Microsoft-logo-1980-1.jpg?width=672&#038;height=454&#038;name=Microsoft-logo-1980-1.jpg " target="_blank" rel="noopener">logo from 1980</a>. 
</p>
<p>
I will say that the font — Segoe Sans, aka Microsoft’s brand font since 2012 and the typeface that its current logo is set in — does not quite stand up to the rest of the identity elements. I understand the need to have some continuity with the overall brand, but it feels soft and out of place here, despite being rationalized in the press release as “reflecting clarity and momentum.” It would have been great to see them go with something bolder and fresher that could better hold its own within the system and use Segoe as a supporting typeface instead.

In an era where memes featuring 2000s Windows pop-ups have become internet cultural currency, capitalizing on classic Microsoft interfaces as a key graphic theme is another so-obvious-it’s-brilliant move by Koto— one that could only truly work, authentically, for this particular brand in this particular moment.

<p>
The elements come together in a handful of vague applications that successfully evoke a sense of intense nostalgia colored through a distinctly modern lens, and although it’s a feast for the eyes, it was at this point where I found myself asking… who exactly is all this for? Branding is typically so focused on a specific target audience with a particular desired end goal for said audience, but in this case, neither is especially clear, and Koto’s presentation gives barely any insight into how all this might get applied. Presumably it’s meant to resonate with some die-hard Microsoft users who might be excited about a <a href="https://s7d2.scene7.com/s7viewers/html5/MixedMediaViewer.html?asset=microsoftcorp/50th_anniversary&#038;config=microsoftcorp/MixedMedia_light&#038;serverUrl=https://s7d2.scene7.com/is/image/&#038;contenturl=https://s7d2.scene7.com/is/content/&#038;videoserverurl=https://s7d2.scene7.com/is/content&#038;culture=en-us&#038;country=us&#038;culture=en-us&#038;country=us " target="_blank" rel="noopener">new Teams background</a>, and more likely, the company’s investors, partners, and 200k+ employees, but it’s not entirely clear how that gap is being bridged.

<p>
Given a dearth of application examples, I did some light sleuthing on the interwebs to find out how the theoretical would translate to the actual, unavoidably getting a little bit watered down in the process. I will say that, with the exception of the use of Segoe Serif on the <a href="https://unlocked.microsoft.com/50th/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Microsoft blog</a> (which feels even worse than just using the sans), this seems to be a rare scenario in which the execution of the identity by the client appears to be decently faithful to the original spirit (if not the high level of polish) of the studio’s design.

<p class="end">
At the end of the day, as I am <strong>a)</strong> not a Microsoft employee and <strong>b)</strong> a staunch despiser of every Microsoft product I have ever interacted with, this identity was not meant for me, and there are parts of it I find vaguely baffling that perhaps a true Microsoft stan would better appreciate. That said, it feels at once incredibly unexpected and entirely fitting for the company, and offers a visual feast that anyone on the internet, particularly a child of the ’90s such as myself, can appreciate (while simultaneously cringing at).

<p>Hit refresh on your browser if they don’t show up at first. Most of the Instagram activity this year happened through Stories and we tried to capture as many as possible in two separate highlights — <a href="https://www.instagram.com/stories/highlights/18003798830732388/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Day 1</a> / <a href="https://www.instagram.com/stories/highlights/17951812661946493/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Day 2</a> — and there is a ton of them on LinkedIn, which we have <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/inhouseinfocus/posts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reposted on our page</a> but that cannot be embedded here.</p>
