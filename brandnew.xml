By uniting functionality from Ethereum, Cosmos, Polkadot and more into a single platform, Moonbeam solves today’s fragmented user experience — unlocking true interoperability and paving the way for the next generation of applications. The Moonbeam platform uses integrated cross-chain messaging to allow developers to create smart contracts that access services across many remote blockchains. This approach, plus Moonbeam’s developer-friendly EVM platform, vast tool support, and modern Substrate architecture, creates the ideal development environment for building connected applications.&#8221;</p>

This rebrand and website relaunch aims to reignite Moonbeam with a unifying brand that gives our solutions a higher purpose and rallies our community, new builders, and internal teams behind one singular, inspiring vision.<br /><br />Moonbeam’s 3d assets depict the exciting frontier of multi-chain technology. Surreal landscapes and geometric patterns create an ethereal world, tapping into the duality of the moonbeam name – a scientific phenomena, but also a natural source of wonder.<br /><br />For the motion, we've incorporated several animations under three thematic categories: glimmering heading type, shimmering borders, and rolling monotypes. These micro-animations not only subtly emit the brand's language but also make the website feel more cinematic and premium, thus building brand equity.

                                            <p><strong>Opinion</strong><br />
                                            The old logo looked it belonged on the murder hotel of a Tarantino movie and even by those standards it was a rather clunky logo but in the context of a Web3-crypto-something-wallet-or-other, it was completely out of place. The new logo maintains the moon-reflecting-on-a-body-of-water motif and executes it beautifully as a crisp “O” shape that smoothly ripples into liquid that is not even there… we all just assume it is, based on how properly this is drawn. The wordmark, in a slender geometric sans serif, looks pretty decent and the “O”s in “MOON” nicely <em>reflect</em> the icon. From here, things get weird and not entirely in a good way…<span></span> If I had to choose a single quirky comparison to try to summarize what we are looking at is that this all looks like the resulting progeny of <em>Minority Report</em> and <em>Avatar: The Way of Water</em> coming together to make a crypto baby. The explanation of the 3D graphics — representing “the exciting frontier of multi-chain technology” — is as baffling as the resulting compositions of underwater anemones, pulsing bubbles, and other micro-organisms of some sort. Maybe to some people these instantly give multi-chain technology but I am not one of them. For what it's worth, I like looking at them… they are kind of enthralling but they evoke nothing in me and I thought we were done with the ambiguous 3D stuff to signify crypto about two years ago.<span></span> The typographic layer on top of it all is kind of interesting, at least when it's at its most basic just using a sans serif and an obligatory monospace but the inclusion of a blackletter, a heavy rounded sans, and a chiseled sans, seems completely unnecessary and about ten design ideas too many coming together all at once. To designer and client credit, the website is actually kind of cool and where I guess all of this sort of pays off as it feels like you landed in another planet where regular cash has been outlawed and you have to mine your own crypto to survive in this Wild Wild West of benevolent anemones. Overall, this feels a little too self-indulgent and without any clear purpose or message but it is, undeniably, a visually rich universe they have created and maybe that's all that was needed.</p>

Centred on Deloraine, it stretches from the Great Western Tiers to Launceston, offering natural attractions like Liffey Falls and Mole Creek Caves. Popular with both tourists and locals, Meander Valley combines rural tranquillity with a strong sense of community, making it a gateway to outdoor adventure, artisan produce, and cultural heritage. It&#8217;s a place with a lot to offer, but lacked the identity to convey it as it is a somewhat newly established region. To help put the region on the map, Meander Valley enlisted the help of Australian agency <a href="https://www.forthepeople.agency" target="_blank" rel="noopener">For the People</a>.</p>

As a relatively new municipality, Meander Valley wasn’t on the map (in some cases, quite literally). Partnering with the local Council, we set out to create a place brand that would establish Meander Valley as a recognised region, unifying the community’s identity and helping them share their abundance with the world. A suite of patterns weave it all together, with each thread following the natural topography of the land—from the winding roads, to the straight crop rows.This is carried into the logo, which follows the region’s meandering rivers and pulls on the threads of the past. Its distinctive ‘M’ shape represents the Great Western Tiers, while a hidden ‘V’ symbolises the fertile valley beneath.

<p>As a &#8220;relatively new municipality&#8221;, Meander Valley had no previous identity or logo to comment on. Instead we have some classic, regional-council style logos that made up the various parts of the region. Not much to comment on either as their relevance is pretty minor but they&#8217;ve been craftily used as inspiration for the new logo, which is nice to see. On that, the new logo draws from the meandering rivers and tiered landscapes of the region all wrapped up within the letter “M”. For the People claim there&#8217;s a hidden “V” in there, which sure I guess I can see&#8230; but there&#8217;s also a hidden “N”, “A”, and “L” if you&#8217;re really stretching. I just don&#8217;t think it needs any more depth or wit, it&#8217;s a solid marque which takes me back to a classic era of logo design a la Lance Wyman. Crucially though it just feels at home representing a municipality; it has a corporate strength and solidity to it but with enough softness – inspired by the landscape of the region – to help represent the people within.</p> 

<p>The logotype — which adopts the new custom brand font that I&#8217;ll talk more about below — has an odd, asymmetrical nature to it, hinting that this isn&#8217;t your average regional identity but something a bit more down to earth and hand-crafted. If I&#8217;m being uber critical I would like to have seen a slightly better balance between the thickness of the strokes of the “M”s and the thicker parts of the letters to help unify them more but it really is a small detail from a font that adds flavour to a logo that could easily have fallen into a stale and corporate style if it played it too safe.</p>

<blockquote>
We spent weeks exploring the region; visiting local spots, running workshops with residents and having countless conversations (and cups of tea) with everyone from cafe owners to conservationists, farmers to friendly neighbours. Whether they were sharing some fresh produce or their favourite stories, it was clear the Meander Valley had a lot to give. But with so much abundance, the community struggled to its common ground. They needed a shared story for the region—one that celebrated the rich diversity of the Valley, while bringing them closer to the source of it all. What brought the region together had been right beneath our feet the entire time. From the local produce, to local businesses and a thriving local community — Meander Valley had grown from Fertile Ground.
<br><br>
A suite of custom illustrations celebrate the diversity of life in Meander Valley and everything the community is growing on this fertile ground — from crops, to cows and local clubs. Like all things made in Meander Valley, they’re organic, handcrafted and full of local flavour.

<p>Before we get into the identity assets it&#8217;s worth mentioning the brand idea. Personally, I appreciate seeing these presented in case studies as they help us understand the platform from which the identity is built from and how to contextualise our critique. &#8220;Grown from fertile ground&#8221; is a humble and soft proposition that aptly sets the tone for the identity; rooting Meander Valley to the ground and connecting it to the earth around it.</p>

<p>Identity-wise, we&#8217;ll kick things off with the most striking aspect of the brand ingredients: its illustrations. A set designed on a patchwork-inspired grid, symbolising the &#8220;community&#8217;s crafty spirit&#8221; and visually connecting everything the region has to offer. I&#8217;m loving how there&#8217;s a roughness to it where patches don&#8217;t meet perfectly, how each illustration feels like it has been cut out of paper and assembled by hand, and the grainy, paper-like texture overlayed on top. All of this just adds up to create a humble and hand-crafted feeling, whilst cleverly providing a solution to convey the sheer amount Meander Valley does.</p>

<p>On their own they would feel too plain, and arguably share quite a few stylistic similarities with another of <a href="https://www.forthepeople.agency/projects/blue-mountains" target="_blank" rel="noopener">For the People&#8217;s regional branding</a>. But the patchwork idea helps move them on and gives them their own look. The simple, stop-motion animations are a cute final touch and adds life to an already rich style. The colour palette is about as varied as the region itself; bringing together some lovely, earthy tones and brighter hues in striking combinations. Most brands would only opt for one selection of the combinations here so credit to For the People for really going for it and creating some delightful colour combos and actually making them work well together! Oh, and that blanket – <em>swoons</em>.</p>

<p>Also featured is a topography inspired pattern that sits in the background of designs. It&#8217;s pretty inoffensive and adds visual texture to places, but largely it just sits in the background without a huge amount of stand out. I&#8217;m questioning ever so slightly how crucial it is? Nonetheless, it serves as another tool to reflect the ground-based idea driving the identity.</p>

<blockquote>
In Meander Valley, the locals always have time for a yarn. They chat on the street, lean over neighbours’ fences, huddle around tables and stop to catch up on a ‘quick trip’ to the shops. The voice of the Valley is shaped by the stories we heard and defined by the community’s grounded nature, generous spirit and appreciation for the abundance around them. 
<br><br>
Simple poems replicate the feeling of meandering, connecting different places and experiences with a gentle, flowing rhythm. While our custom typeface, inspired by farm-gate stalls and historic signage, adds some extra local charm.

<p>Leading the charge in typography is Meander Display – a custom font designed by For the People &#8211; paired with <a href="https://fonts.floriankarsten.com/montagu-slab" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Montagu Slab by Florian Karsten</a> for body copy. We also have <a href="https://hanken.co/en-gb/products/hk-grotesk" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HK Grotesk</a> used to a lesser extent, which I can only find on the website further below. The custom font is &#8220;inspired by farm-gate stalls and historic signage&#8221;, I can&#8217;t immediately picture what a farm-gate stall looks like in my head but the font definitely delivers on a retro and artisanal feeling on initial viewing. There&#8217;s a slight imbalance to the letters as counters sit off-centre and thickness of stems vary. Suffice to say these slight, but deliberate, &#8220;imperfections&#8221; come together to create something that captures its intended feeling. The secondary font reinforces the retro tone with a rarely seen, but ever increasingly popular, slab serif. I can&#8217;t quite put my finger on why it works so well for me, it might be that it instantly feels a bit old-school in nature but with a slight smartness to it. Either way, I&#8217;ve tried to get this font to work many times but never found the right fit. That might be because I never had a humble Tasmanian region to brand as this feels right at home for Meander Valley.</p>

<p>The font is deployed boldly in large headlines and on curved paths. This definitely starts to feel more akin to historical signage and brings to life the poetic tone of voice which adds some charming and whimsical storytelling to the mix. With so much at play here, it&#8217;s why I begin to see the topography patterns as a little bit surplus to the requirements… could just be me though.</p>

<p>Very much the same in the remaining applications of collateral, advertising, and swag. At points I find the sheer variety in designs starts to make it feel inconsistent, for example where the 3-up posters begin to stray from the rest of identity as they don&#8217;t feature the colour palette or illustrations. However, what this does show is how the brand can dial up and down its visual intensity where needed; by using larger portions of the patchwork illustrations, or leading with imagery, or going a bit more formal like shown in the flags.</p>

<p class="end">All in all, as I meandered my way through this review I found myself more and more drawn into the region. I get the sense that For the People really got to know the people the brand represents and it shows in the distinctive identity they created for Meander Valley. In a world where we&#8217;re so used to seeing fast-moving and high impact brands, it&#8217;s refreshing to see someone slow it down a bit. For me, it successfully sets the scene of a picturesque, charming and diverse region, one deeply connected to the earth and their community – Making MV an MVP of regional branding.</p>

Split shatters the illusion of timekeeping, stripping it to its unfiltered truth. Unapologetic and resilient, Split doesn’t elevate egos or hide behind gold-plated promises. Instead, it’s a reminder: there’s only the now, no past, no future. Just this moment, this collective journey. Time is what we own, and we owe it to each other to make it count. Every watch tells a story and starts a conversation. For every Split watch sold, we fund an hour of therapy for someone in need, in partnership with Anna Freud.&#8221;</p>

                                            <p><strong>Relevant quote</strong><br /><em>With a personal journey rooted deeply in overcoming trauma and fostering open dialogue, [founder Ed Margulies] envisioned Split as a catalyst for meaningful conversations about mental wellbeing.<br /><br />Our brief was to develop a brand strategy centred on honesty, openness, and genuine human connection. Rejecting typical luxury aesthetics, we crafted a visual identity that features intentionally fractured imagery, physically distorted using ink rollers, scrapers, and scalpels. This distinctive visual treatment symbolises the complexities of individual struggles and the power of shared experiences. Typography and visual elements were chosen to reflect Split's core belief in the strength of vulnerability, pairing tactile authenticity with contemporary elegance.<br /><br />To extend this ethos digitally, we designed and built a website that serves not only as an e-commerce platform but also as a community hub promoting empathy and solidarity. Real-world photography, vibrant yet nuanced, captures authentic moments of human connection, reinforcing the brand’s mission. Each element of the Split Watches identity communicates clearly and powerfully that luxury can be meaningful and watches can be symbols of solidarity and mutual support.

                                            <p><strong>Opinion</strong><br />
                                            In my bingo card of things I would cover on Brand New in my lifetime I never had watch-meets-mental-health brand but here we are and, as such, there is no existing barometer to judge this against, which is perfectly fine… just unexpected. Starting with the name, there is a lot to like here — even if at times it's hard to tell exactly what we are looking at — as “Split” can trigger a few interesting associations: split personality, split-second decisions, split attention, that in one way or another can be related to time. It's also simply a catchy name.<span></span> The logo, in an almost-disappearing rounded serif, accompanied by an asterisk, has a moody, ghostly appearance that is very un-watch-like, which is the first hint that this is an atypical watch brand. The wordmark looks pretty good and I really like how the asterisk icon — chosen, as explained in Split's about page, “because it speaks to the power of adding depth and meaning to a story” — is placed on the left side, further botching conventions. Also love how it's used on the crown of the watch.<span></span> The visual language leans heavy on a blurry effect for both type and image along with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-BJkDyCdw0c" target="_blank">SE7EN-esque</a> motion treatments — it's most certainly a mood, a vibe, and a state of mind. The few applications shown are pretty cool and eye-catching and the tone of voice is poignant to the point where I'm sitting here questioning time and space. Overall, there is a kind of magnetic attraction to it and while it's working on me I also find it a little disconcerting as a medium to sell what are mostly “normal” watches. Meaning not that they are boring watches… they are actually kind of cool… but once you get past the dark, mysterious sheen of the brand and messaging, the product experience is no more different than that of a regular fancy watch. </p>

                                            <p>Established in 2015 as Konsus, <a href="https://www.superside.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Superside</a>, as it was renamed in 2019, is a subscription-based, on-demand creative service that offers access to more than 650 designers, creatives, and artists spread all round the world to large consultancies, corporate strategy teams, investment firms and similar, with need for ongoing support on graphic design, presentation design, and other creative tasks. Its service sits somewhere in the middle of a Venn diagram of hiring a temporary freelancer, ordering a specific task on Fiverr, and having an in-house team as Superside is able to accommodate all sorts of tasks — from polishing PowerPoint presentations to generating social media assets to putting together email campaigns — on short notice and with a quick turnaround. Like many other services, it now also touts its AI-powered production capabilities, which, to be honest, I don&#8217;t know what it means and I&#8217;d rather not find out but with 3,000 projects completed in 2024 I guess it means it can do things fast(er). Recently, Superside introduced a new identity designed in-house.</p>

<span id="more-307263"></span>

<blockquote>Our goal with this rebrand was simple: show how much we’ve grown, and how exciting the work we do has become. Superside isn’t just another agency. We’re not a freelance network either. We’re something different—a creative team&#8217;s creative team.<br /><br />In our rebrand, we wanted to bring all of this to the surface. To show how we’re constantly solving for the gap between technology and talent. And how we see AI not as a replacement for creativity, but as an amplifier—another tool in the hands of great creative minds.<br /><br /> The rebrand was executed in just 6 months—down from the typical years—through AI-driven processes and the input of almost 100 creatives.</blockquote><h3>Superside provided text</h3>

<blockquote>Let’s start with the easy part: The Superside logo isn’t new, but it’s improved! We’ve made subtle tweaks, refining our already iconic logo by condensing the signature Superside squiggle. It’s sharper, sleeker and just as fun—especially now that it’s brought to life with motion design.‎</blockquote><h3><a href="https://www.superside.com/blog/new-brand-has-landed" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Superside blog post</a></h3>

<p>The main hook into this project is the logo evolution not because it&#8217;s the greatest or most revolutionary but it was most definitely needed and the result is sufficiently satisfying. I could have sworn I covered the old logo on Brand New but that wasn&#8217;t the case… maybe it was submitted as a tip and I didn&#8217;t act on it but for some reason that old “S” was filed somewhere deep in my memory as I thought/think the squiggly shape was a rather clever way of representing an “S”. In the new version, the “S” shape is now a little bit clearer while retaining the cropped look that makes it feel as if it&#8217;s part of an infinite loop, although the more I stare at it, the more I think I like the old “S” was more convincing in that respect. The rest of the letters is what makes this a better solution though, with their taller x-height and lighter weight… it just feels better balanced.</p>

<blockquote>Perhaps the biggest change we’ve made is moving away from illustrations and leaning into photorealistic AI imagery. But instead of going the stereotypical AI route of neon colors and whimsical scenarios, we’ve grounded everything in the natural beauty of the world around us.<br /><br />Beyond the artistry, photorealistic AI imagery lets us showcase our design sophistication. Any designer knows that getting humans and nature “right” with AI is challenging. One small mishap can completely dismantle an image.‎</blockquote><h3><a href="https://www.superside.com/blog/new-brand-has-landed" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Superside blog post</a></h3>

<p>As we get into the identity elements and application, the “AI-driven processes and the input of almost 100 creatives” that fueled the redesign start to be felt and I don&#8217;t mean that in the most positive of ways. The new color palette is fine but there is nothing particularly memorable about it; the typeface choices — the free <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Inter+Tight" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Inter Tight</a> and <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Instrument+Serif" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Instrument Serif</a> — are fairly generic; the icon set and spot illustrations beat to their own drum; and the AI imagery… well, no matter how much anyone rationalizes it or philosophizes about it, it looks like AI imagery and while that may be attractive to some of their clients, to me and I&#8217;m guessing most here, it&#8217;s a big turn-off and there is nothing impressive about it. The actual photography is okay but perhaps a little cliché-ish. Props though for getting someone in an actual spacesuit to frolic in an actual beach — I would love to see more of that lo-fi surrealist approach that takes actual creativity and energy to make it happen.</p>

<blockquote>When reimagining our brand, we embraced AI as our primary creative tool. Our team developed a carefully crafted prompt architecture that became the foundation of our new visual identity.<br /><br />The approach was comprehensive, letting us define every conceivable parameter—from image elements and color palettes to subject styling, lighting, shadows and camera angles. The result? High-quality, on-brand imagery that precisely captures our desired tonality, texture and narrative.</blockquote><h3><a href="https://www.superside.com/blog/new-brand-has-landed" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Superside blog post</a></h3>

<p>The applications are highly competent and appropriate but far from unique or distinctive. In fact, I was a little taken aback by how close the visual language — particularly the color combos and mixing of serif and sans serif — is <a href="https://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/new_logo_and_identity_for_fiverr_by_koto.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to Koto&#8217;s Fiverr identity</a>. I&#8217;m not implying they copied it directly but, again, somewhere in the “AI-driven processes and the input of almost 100 creatives” approach, some form of direct or indirect influence may have seeped in.</p>

<p>Their <em><a href="https://www.superside.com/reports/overcommitted-report" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Overcommitted</a></em> digital and print publication is actually quite nice as it displays a slightly more evident input of human art direction and execution so, yeah, do more of that.</p>

<p class="end">I am unsure what the general perception from the design industry at large is towards Superside… it seems like they&#8217;ve picked a lane that isn&#8217;t too damaging to freelancers or small design firms or potential in-house employees as they do fulfill a particular production niche that most designers would rather avoid doing but, just for the record, this post is not any kind of endorsement… it&#8217;s simply just coverage of a design that happened within our/your orbit. Overall, this is a decent evolution that is mostly a reflection of the general, mainstream direction most design is going in at the moment so just like the 2019 Superside redesign involved a lot of Corporate-Memphis-y illustration as the style du jour, this redesign adopts AI imagery (and color palette and typography and layout approach) so, in a way, it&#8217;s an actual embodiment of Superside&#8217;s offering — and I mean this is in the least snarky way possible — which is delivering the status quo, fast.</p>
