                                            <p>&amp;Walsh has launched Type of Feeling, a type foundry where “each typeface in the collection is inspired by specific feelings, which are embedded in the terminals, tails, counters, and more, bringing an emotional depth to typography.” For a limited time, the initial seven type families are available to license for personal use for $75. This led me to read the EULA and it&#8217;s interesting to see that using their fonts on social media requires its own unique license, which I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve seen before. For using them in logos you also need a special license, but that is more common for display typefaces.

Building and repairing bikes is what we do. Whether it’s something off the shelf, or a personal and detailed custom build, our team has the skills and experience to make sure your new ride is all you’d hoped for. Alongside our commuting and touring offerings we carry Melbourne’s biggest range of adventure ready bikes from Surly, Kona, Salsa, Bombtrack, Wilde, Tumbleweed and Pelago. If you’re just starting out in bikepacking, our team have thousands of kilometres and many nights out under their belts, and aim to make sure your first campouts with your bike are comfortable and enjoyable. We’re as close to a one-stop bikepacking shop as you’ll find in Australia.&#8221;</p>

The folks at Off Course have always sought to support and encourage cyclists of all types to explore everything that bikes have to offer and their new name celebrates the diversity of riders and their pursuits on and off the road.

                                            The old logo wasn't much of a logo, with the long name typed out in a rounded monospace but, with the name in a single line, there was no stacking involved to showcase the monospace and it just yielded some weird kerning. Starting with the new name, everything about this shift is fantastic. At least in American parlance, perhaps it's different in Australian, “Commuter Cycles” sounded more like a city-dwelling bike-sharing program and not a source for two-wheeled adventures. The new name is so good, encouraging riders to take the path less trodden while also sounding like, <em>of course</em>, this cycling shop is your best choice.<span></span> The new logo is simply awesome and perfectly executed in its wobbly-ness and bounciness with the letters going slightly off course in their own right. It looks great in a single line or stacked and it holds up perfectly well on top of photography. The sub-brands, with the illustrations wedged in between the two words are fun and charming but I would just question the few instances where lines connect directly to the words, as it looks a little odd.<span></span> In application, some of the illustrations have a stipple effect, which I don't think was needed and it doesn't look quite right when applied white on color, as the texture is meant to be a shadow but it's a minor quibble and in something like the note card it does look pretty great. There is not that much to the identity given that this isn't a huge brand but it definitely shines within the small universe of the shop that is packed to the brim with cycling stuff and the brief branded moments within it really stand out and feel at home amidst the controlled chaos. Overall, a super fun rebrand from top to bottom that really captures the joy of getting on a bike and going off course, on course, and everywhere in between.</p>

Launched in 2024, <a href="https://ghost.snap.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ghost</a> is an AR accelerator program by <a href="https://snap.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Snap Inc.</a> in which developers solve real-world problems through collaboration and rapid experimentation. It was created to uncover innovative uses for AR and to help creators leverage the technology in their work and businesses. Ghost invites innovative teams to bring their creative solutions to life, whether they&#8217;re exploring a new product idea or strengthening an existing business. The new identity has been designed by San Francisco, CA-based <a href="https://play.studio/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Play</a>.

Ghost came to us for a new look — and there was a lot to achieve. The new brand would need to position Ghost at the forefront of AR innovation and signal its world-altering potential, create a platform to showcase creators and their work, and inspire top-level talent to come on board.

<p>
Despite Play stating that Ghost came to them <a href="https://play.studio/work/snapchat-ghost" target="_blank" rel="noopener">seeking a &#8220;new look,&#8221;</a> I couldn&#8217;t find any examples of an old identity. So, starting from scratch, the wordmark is a pleasing, rounded, entirely lowercase serif with an icon hidden within the counters of the &#8220;g&#8221; and &#8220;o.&#8221; Though nothing revolutionary, it is well-executed with some interesting letterforms and choices that result in a simple yet fluid, slightly nuanced mark.
</p> 

<p>
The icon, two opaque circles representing the eyes of Snapchat&#8217;s ghost icon, is even less revolutionary than the wordmark. Without the accompanying Snapchat logo with added eyes, I think it would be difficult to discern the intended reference. In the 3D rendering, eyes or glasses certainly weren&#8217;t the first image I thought I was looking at, especially as the grass begins to sprout at the very center of this watery globe. And then the second one appears. Lots of images came to mind, some less appropriate than others, but glasses or eyes were not at the top of the list. The 3D rendering aside, the icon isn&#8217;t particularly strong on its own—it resembles two-thirds of an ellipsis, or maybe a frozen loading icon. On physical applications, like totes or stickers, it hardly stands out as a logo. Paired with the wordmark, it&#8217;s better, but still not distinctive or memorable, easily fading into the background. It gains a bit more life in digital applications when it functions as glasses, either revealing an image or bringing a blurred photo into focus, but I&#8217;m not sold on a static pair of circles as an ownable emblem.
</p>

<p>
I would have liked to learn more about the concept, but unfortunately, the project page doesn&#8217;t go into detail about the logo at all, not even the wordmark. Perhaps additional context would help me appreciate it more because once it&#8217;s clear, I do find the concept to be approaching clever. However, if a design requires explanation to be understood, it&#8217;s probably not the best design.

<blockquote>
The custom typeface, designed in collaboration with Displaay, further reinforces the idea of a brand that adapts to its context, adjusting in volume to enhance&mdash;not overshadow&mdash;its surroundings. At its loudest, it comes alive before your eyes, twisting and turning through interaction, bringing energy into unconventional spaces, and ensuring ownability in even the briefest of glances. At its softest it virtually vanishes, allowing the content to shine.

<p>
On a more positive note, I&#8217;m quite fond of Ghost Sans Display, the custom typeface built in partnership with <a href="https://displaay.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Displaay</a>. It successfully achieves the goal of &#8220;enhancing&mdash;not overshadowing&mdash;its surroundings.&#8221; The typeface is unique and has a spectral quality without being too on the nose for a brand named &#8220;Ghost.&#8221; It&#8217;s most effective and fun when used intermittently; while it might be overwhelming in full paragraphs or even longer sentences, when paired with Ghost Sans&#8217;s regular weight, it works great.

Ghost&#8217;s color palette thoughtfully combines functional, neutral, and vibrant hues to reflect the diversity of Ghost projects, and to convey the depth and variety of the AR experience. It feels distinctive and forward-looking, while still harmonizing with the established Snapchat palette.

<p>
In a grid format, the color palette is incredibly bright and vibrant. In actual application, however, the neutral tones are the primary colors, with smaller pops of the more saturated tones. I find this to be an interesting choice, as the neutral tones feel very organic and natural—quite the opposite of what one might expect from such a futuristic brand concept. Similarly, the illustrations, though not exactly archaic, feel slightly anachronous—perhaps a bit too straightforward in a world of magical futurism. That said, I can appreciate this combination of past and future, simplicity paired with the surreal. However, maybe a bit more nuance, perhaps incorporating some of the wobbly adaptiveness of the custom typeface, could better complement other aspects of the identity.

<blockquote>
We continued to unpack the concept of a brand that stands back and gives space through a system of layered panels that appear throughout the Ghost identity. These layers make room for the multiplicity of AR and the variety of projects at Ghost. The system allows for the combination of project elements from different makers, and enables the brand to show the progression of project elements from draft through development to finished product.

As a whole, Ghost&#8217;s identity often feels a bit disparate, with dissimilar parts sort of stitched together&mdash;but that just may be part of its charm. After all, it&#8217;s an identity for an experimental lab of sorts. While the icon might struggle to stand alone, the overall system has some compelling moments, particularly with the custom typeface. The system effectively conveys an airy and open feel, inviting potential participants to envision their ideas within its flexible framework.

Why is this on Brand New? Because despite the band being on hiatus for 15 years, the above image is a fantastic case of brand recognition that triggers an association to the band&#8217;s classic logo, all based on some very simple and generic design traits: An italic sans serif, two thick strokes, a rectangle. Instantly Oasis.

Trust. It starts and ends with trust. Human to human. Data-point to data-point. So, we started writing and a brand new brand narrative and strategic platform emerged under the umbrella: “Towards a future we can all trust”.<br /><br />From here we created a new brand name, Epical, and crafted a new visual identity radiating with ambition, warmth and of course trust. Epical is here and launched, equipped with all the tools necessary to bring their brand to life anyhow and everywhere. A new identity showing the way for trust-makers all over the Nordics to join their quest and build a future we can trust. Thank you Epical for a brilliant collaboration!

                                            <p><strong>Opinion</strong><br />
                                            Given the company's recent founding (2023) and that Identity Works also created the name, I am guessing the old logo was meant as nothing more than a placeholder but they still tried to infuse some personality into the generic geometric sans serif wordmark by curving the terminals of the “e”, “i”, and “c”. It wasn't good. I mean, it was properly executed, it just resulted in some weird-looking letterforms. The new logo is far more interesting if also far more trendy with the <a href="https://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/tag/loops" target="_blank">loop-y sans serif treatment</a> that was <a href="https://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/the_year_in_review_part_2_recurring_trends_2021.php" target="_blank">a big trend in 2021</a> and that we've seen twice — <a href="https://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/new_logo_and_identity_for_planu_by_holmandesign.php" target="_blank">A</a>, <a href="https://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/new_logo_and_identity_for_ovarian_cancer_action_by_revolt.php" target="_blank">B</a> — this month alone. Nonetheless, it's a nice-looking logo that has been well drawn. I'm still trying to understand what the name means… is it something so epic, that it's epical? Something that's at the epicenter of something else? Something special? Interpretations welcome.<span></span> The identity goes in a number of different directions, all of them interesting on their own but I'm not sure if they belong together. First, there is some charming spot illustrations of people doing things with geometric shapes. Their simplicity and motion are great. Then there is a 3D, fiber-optic-ish loop that is delicious to look at and so expertly crafted but also a bit of a head-scratcher as to its purpose other than, perhaps, the notion of funneling data. Then there is the headline typography that uses <a href="https://www.r-typography.com/fonts/flecha-m" target="_blank">Flecha M</a>, which is a fabulous serif but its hard-angled serifs feel at odds with the logo, the illustrations, and the 3D loop. It perhaps has too much personality to blend in. Still, the applications are done with plenty of conviction, are well crafted, and make a visual splash. Overall, the identity is unclear about what kind of territory it wants to live in — it's part telecom, part DTC food or drink brand, part lifestyle, part tech — but it does look slick and polished.</p>

                                                                    <img src="https://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/wp/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/chime_new.jpg" alt="New Identity for Chime by Jones Knowles Ritchie" />
                                
                                
                                
                                                                                
                                        
                                            
                                            <p>Established in 2012, <a href="https://www.chime.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chime</a> is a fintech company that provides simplified, basic banking services with no monthly fees. Through two banking partners, The Bancorp Bank, N.A. and Stride Bank, N.A. — as Chime is <em>not</em> a bank — users can open a checking account with no monthly fees and a high-yield savings account with automatic savings features along with popular perks like early direct deposit (up to two days) and fee-free overdraft up to $200. Headquartered in San Francisco, with additional offices in Chicago and Vancouver, its reported number of users is somewhere between 15 and 22 million but there is no official number available — point is, it&#8217;s big. This week, Chime began rolling out a new identity designed by <a href="https://jkrglobal.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jones Knowles Ritchie</a>.</p>

<figcaption>Samples of old identity.</figcaption>
</figure>

<blockquote>For over a decade, Chime has challenged the traditional banking sector, recognizing its inadequacy in serving everyday Americans. The evolution of its brand identity delivers an enhanced experience focused on trust, stability, and security, resonating with a growing audience committed to defining their own aspirations. By emphasizing &#8216;progress&#8217; throughout the design, Chime continues to redefine how financial progress is expressed in the modern era.<br /><br />The updated identity strengthens the brands associations with trust and security, while disrupting traditional banking codes through the &#8216;portal to progress&#8217; design concept. This reflects Chime&#8217;s innovative philosophy, which is key to fostering advocacy within the community.</blockquote><h3>Jones Knowles Ritchie provided text</h3>

</figure>

<p>While the logo remains the same in this new identity, it&#8217;s easy to see from the samples of the old identity that Chime was in need of a boost as its soft pastel colors, drop-shadow-ed typography, and multiple illustration styles were feeling a little dated and not nearly as impactful as it might need to be in today&#8217;s world. It was also a bit shy and considering that it is reportedly the leading non-bank-banking-app, it didn&#8217;t feel like a category leader.</p>

<blockquote><strong>Focus On Smart, Simple, and Easy.</strong><br /> The refresh aims to continue enhancing what Chime’s members love most about their experience &#8211; ease and simplicity &#8211; building on its reputation with over 1 million 5-star reviews. These updates emphasize Chime&#8217;s credibility and foundational values. The brand strengthens its primary green palette to evoke security and trust, while introducing a secondary palette to convey freedom, ease, and aspiration. JKR developed an accessible and versatile type system to make the brand&#8217;s messaging more inclusive and accessible to all. The identity includes an intuitive UI toolkit, responsive iconography, and motion principles that highlight forward momentum, unlocking, and the transformative experience associated with using the product as a window to financial progress.</blockquote><h3>Jones Knowles Ritchie provided text</h3>

<p>Driving the identity is a new type family with something borrowed, something new, and something script. Leading the way with something borrowed is Chime Saans, which uses Displaay&#8217;s <a href="https://displaay.net/typeface/saans/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Saans</a> as its starting point although I&#8217;m not sure how it is unique… I think the lowercase &#8220;l&#8221; has a little extra curl that the original doesn&#8217;t. For something new, partnering once more with <a href="https://www.colophon-foundry.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Colophon Foundry</a>, a crisp new serif with some quirky gestures like a tucked-in leg of the “R” serves as a great contrast. For something script, Colophon also created a display typeface with some groovy, loopy characters that play off of the “m” in the Chime logo and that are sprinkled in small doses in Chime Saans. All three make for a comprehensive typographic family that can strike different tones, from serious to playful to informative.</p>

<figcaption>Icon set and typography.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The typography can also be infused with some fun, single-color icons-slash-emojis that replace letters within sentences in fun, contextual ways, e.g. little plants for “grow”, happy face for “progress”, lock for “safe”. These work equally well within the sans or the serif and when shown together as in the green on green samples above, it looks pretty fantastic.</p>

<blockquote><strong>Be More Relatable. </strong><br />The new illustration approach is geared towards enhancing the relatability of the brand by depicting everyday moments. By developing an intuitive typographic language that incorporates expressive alternates and emojis, JKR maintained the soul of the brand to help Chime continue to connect with its growing community of over 7 million members.</blockquote><h3>Jones Knowles Ritchie provided text</h3>

<blockquote><strong>Make Everyday Progress Feel Effortless.</strong><br />The concept of &#8220;portals&#8221; in the design system embody how regular individuals effortlessly access financial advancement. This mirrors Chime&#8217;s products, crafted to alleviate stress and streamline daily progress. By highlighting the synergy between the card and phone, the brand strengthens the connection between product usage and financial progress. Capturing everyday purchase moments through vignettes and photography reinforces the idea that incremental steps and basic usage lead to progress, making the everyday more aspirational.</blockquote><h3>Jones Knowles Ritchie provided text</h3>

<p>Ticking off another box in the JKR formula is a great series of illustrations with some fun, wobbly line work presenting a very diverse crew of Chime users… all leaning exponentially young and clearly signaling who their target audience is. Adding some conceptual flair to the illustrations are the smartphone- and credit-card shaped portals through which these young people go through to achieve their financial goals. It&#8217;s a very clever graphic and storytelling device that works beautifully when animated but gets the point across equally well in static applications. The spot illustrations are great too and all the subtle animations add a ton of personality.</p>

<p>The applications all look great, putting the various elements to good use and not trying to go overboard with complex layouts or needing to flex too hard beyond traditional compositions of left-aligned big type, a photo or an illustration, and the logo. The simplicity of the design is enriched with the strong personality and visual presence of each of the various elements. I feel like I should say more about it but it&#8217;s really fairly straightforward. </p>

<p class="end">Overall, this has all the trimmings of a JKR identity… it&#8217;s visually vibrant, bold, and playful and is delivered with a confident and engaging tone of voice. This now better positions Chime as the go-to option for online banking for a new generation of users that have never filled out a check or faced the indignities of having forgotten to endorse one when depositing a literal paycheck.</p>
