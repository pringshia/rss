                                            <p>The Wyoming Republican Party has sent a cease-and-desist letter to the Committee for Better Sheridan County Leadership (CBSCL) that has been using the Republican&#8217;s well-known elephant symbol as part of their return address in their mailers — you can see a blurry picture of it <a href="https://www.thesheridanpress.com/news/local/sheridanites-receive-cease-and-desist-letter-for-use-of-republican-logo/article_3179fc68-5f04-11ef-a85b-5346aca71b01.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>. The elephant logo is officially a trademark owned by the Republican National Committee and is subject to the same laws that govern any other logo, whether it&#8217;s Nike&#8217;s or Apple&#8217;s. This, however, seems to be lost on the legal counsel for the CBSCL who claims they CAN use the logo and that the cease-and-desist request infringes on their right to free speech and that they will continue to use it, thank you very much, and will counter-sue Wyoming Republican Party if they keep bugging them about it. This lawyer has chosen the hill he is going to die on.

It is the second-oldest continually operating United States bank; its predecessor, Union Bank, was founded in 1792. State Street is ranked 14th on the list of largest banks in the United States by assets. It is one of the largest asset management companies in the world with US$3.7 trillion under management and US$40.0 trillion under custody and administration in 2023. It is the largest custodian bank in the world, providing securities services and it is considered a systemically important bank by the Financial Stability Board. Along with BlackRock and Vanguard, State Street is considered to be one of the Big Three index fund managers that dominate corporate America. The company is ranked 316th on the Fortune 500 as of 2022. The company is on the list of the banks that are too big to fail published by the Financial Stability Board. It is rated by Visual Capitalist as the third U.S. bank by uninsured deposits, with 91.2% of deposits being uninsured. The company is named after State Street in Boston, which was known as the ‘Great Street to the Sea’ in the 18th century as Boston became a flourishing maritime capital. The company&#8217;s logo formerly included a clipper ship to reflect the maritime industry in Boston during this time.&#8221; (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_Street_Corporation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wikipedia</a>)</p>

                                            <p><strong>Relevant quote</strong><br /><em>We partnered with State Street to evolve its brand, first with a compelling articulation of State Street’s story, differentiation and vision for the future, and then with a reimagined identity built for the modern world. Our remit was clear: create a category-leading brand that unified State Street and communicated the breadth of its offerings.<br /><br />We needed to create a dynamic, ownable brand expression that would reinforce State Street’s differentiation in a category where competitors are modernizing and raising the bar. The new logo evokes the brand’s name—the central ‘street’ within the symbol represents the journey State Street designs for its clients — helping them stay on track, turn market change into potential, and continue to be the steadying hand and stabilizing force that’s reshaping the industry. The central line of the symbol extends across the system, serving as the underlying grid as well as a visible connective element through photography, patterns and icons, acting as a nod to State Street platforms that underpin financial markets.<br /><br />The brand expression integrates State Street’s longevity and vision, using elements that take inspiration from both traditional and future-facing cues. This includes adopting a modern serif typeface and energizing State Street’s legacy blue. Mezzotint images provide a distinct way of capturing subjects, combining the bespoke quality of engraving with a modern digital language.<br /><br />The new system is built to thrive across digital channels, with fresh content, imagery, and styles that cascade across platforms. To celebrate the new brand, we helped coordinate a robust re-introduction of State Street across all stakeholder groups. This included a rebuild of the State Street corporate website, social media presence, launch microsite, presentation system, pitch narrative and more. These activations showcase State Street’s story, commitments, expression and leadership, with opportunities for audiences to engage across content and media or connect directly.

                                            <p><strong>Opinion</strong><br />
                                            With a ship icon <a href="https://logos.fandom.com/wiki/State_Street" target="_blank">since the 1970s</a>, the latest version was a very conservative, financial-looking drawing that portrayed the institution as sturdy and trustworthy amidst the metaphorical rough waters of the world of money. It was fairly antiquated, though, and now made the company come across as old and stodgy. The new logo abandons the ship for the first time in a long time and introduces a more abstract representation of its name with an icon depicting a street running straight across a parallel, winding road. There is a nice symmetry to the icon and it has a smooth flow. The  wordmark is simple and safe, complementing the icon well with its stacked composition, further establishing that strong horizon line. The That Blue color choice adds a touch of Finance Nouveau, quickly signaling this is a digitally-aware and contemporary institution (while also having a bit of a forced “aren't we hip with our electric blue color?!" vibe).<span></span> The identity seems to go in a number of directions and adopt various stylistic approaches in a way that feels like they are looking to see what sticks. There is the 3D wavy patterns, the icon in 3D dipping in and out of a surface, there is etched illustrations, there is birds, there is people… it's a little all over the place. The most effective gesture is the one most closely tied to the logo, with the thin lines literally forming baselines for the typography — the very nice <a href="https://lettersfromsweden.se/font/lab-antiqua/" target="_blank">Lab Antiqua</a>. Overall, everything is well executed and the influx of energy of That Blue is hard to deny, helping State Street sail into a new era.</p>

Owned by Greece-based <a href="https://kaizengaming.com/home" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kaizen Gaming</a>, one of the fastest-growing game tech companies internationally, Betano is available in 15 countries and offers a wide range of products, including sportsbook, live betting, and casino-style games. While big in Europe, perhaps it&#8217;s bigger in Brazil, where it is considered the most recognizable and trusted betting brand. Part of its success is the company&#8217;s expanding sponsorship of football teams around the world, including powerhouses like Aston Villa in the UK, Olympiacos F.C. in Greece, and the “Big Three” of S.L. Benfica, Sporting CP, and FC Porto in Portugal. Betano was a global sponsor of the recent 2024 Copa América and also the first ever betting partner of UEFA EURO this Summer as well. Earlier this year, Betano introduced a new identity designed by London, UK-based <a href="https://www.nomadstudio.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nomad</a>.</p>

<blockquote>Rapid payouts, super-fast updates reflecting real-world events, and the sheer adrenaline rush that iGaming offers made the lightning bolt the perfect symbol for Betano. With energetic custom lettering and a detachable “B” for icon use, the logo delivers maximum impact wherever it appears.</blockquote><h3><a href="https://www.nomadstudio.com/work/betano" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nomad project page</a></h3>

<p>The old logo was… something. I mean, it was clearly a “B” but there are so many unanswered questions: why hollow? where is the light source coming from that it casts shadows and lights symmetrically? what otherworldly material is it made from? how much crack does one need to be on to construct and SVG like <a href="https://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/betano_old_svg.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this</a>? what does it mean? We will never know but some questions are best left unanswered. The new logo is a big departure with a fun and dynamic wordmark that cleverly, if a little forcefully, embeds a lightning bolt in the “B” amidst an italic sans serif (that appears to use <a href="https://www.schick-toikka.com/chap" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chap</a> as a foundation).</p>

<p>Without the quirkiness of Chap&#8217;s “e” and “a”, the bolt “B” might not have worked as it has too many angles and too many curves going in too many directions but the “e” and “a” provide the right balance of contrasting features to make the “B” look normal. There is also a nice flow in he “eta” trio with the customized curved endings. I&#8217;m not sure if I completely buy the relevance of a lightning bolt for an online betting company — I also keep thinking of battery brand, <a href="https://www.google.com/search?sca_esv=5eda41d0b524b30a&#038;sca_upv=1&#038;sxsrf=ADLYWIKMpUshbs0c_fVBLNQj-v2h34dQ1w:1724234714690&#038;q=rayovac+logo&#038;udm=2&#038;fbs=AEQNm0DfIOrc-JVK7JSIXTRypzh1d0Xgc-Qx-MWluXtsBh8oLqezDGS-GBRoVhGkujFN9L89G8OpQ_4dZf-PrNf_f2qsBtQmtLqsm6yxAHTedliasJBB9FQSsYwZnyPqqc5ldCsnkGqLbFClqXddPoG99GG8FOnDSp-qlZzIkKjMKkP9CcmcXuDZxiWgaR1I6cT030OuyH9GGaehPhQtpHoYO4976gklqg&#038;sa=X&#038;ved=2ahUKEwi3wLbt6oWIAxXFMtAFHdNbEN0QtKgLegQIFBAB&#038;biw=1299&#038;bih=1093&#038;dpr=2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rayovac</a> — but I do appreciate that it&#8217;s a broad enough concept of energy and excitement that encompasses completely different forms of betting (sports and casino-style games). The logo is a bit of an acquired taste but I do like it.</p>

<blockquote>Avoiding generic stock photography that dominates the sector, the Betano illustration suite injects personality across the brand. We commissioned Ed McGowan to create an illustration style depicting characters and players in surreal scenarios, blending sportsbook and casino iconography in unique ways.</blockquote><h3><a href="https://www.nomadstudio.com/work/betano" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nomad project page</a></h3>

<p>Driving the identity is <a href="https://mass-driver.com/typefaces/md-nichrome/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MD Nichrome</a>, with its funky width shifts in different characters. It&#8217;s somehow a great complement and contrast to the italic wordmark and helps expand the loose and fun vibe hinted at by the logo. The illustrations by <a href="https://www.instagram.com/parkopolo/?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ed McGowan</a> are groovy and I like the unconventional approach of white strokes on dark backgrounds and how they mix in gradients in the different objects to make the humans (and sasquatches) stand out — also, is that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ultimate_Warrior" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Ultimate Warrior</a> with the sasquatch? Legend. Add in the graphics for the various online casino games and things get a little chaotic but, still, a fun combination of elements.</p>

<blockquote>Whether placing a $5 bet to transform a dreary kickoff into a major showdown or hitting the jackpot on your final free spin, Betano adds a dash of excitement to the everyday. Born from the logo’s lightning bolt icon, the patterns and graphic language  create a flexible brand system that energises every touchpoint across the brand.</blockquote><h3><a href="https://www.nomadstudio.com/work/betano" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nomad project page</a></h3>

<p>The bolt serving as a foundation to create an angled underlying grid on which larger bolts can be drawn on to frame imagery and messaging is pretty great. It&#8217;s both simple to execute and fun to look at in the resulting compositions that can adapt to to any ratio. The identity does have the very difficult task of having to work appropriately with both serious football (and other sports) photography as well as with video-game-like graphics that are mostly visually bonkers and, amazingly, it manages to do so in both cases, making the sports photography more exciting and taming the game graphics by using the bolts to literally keep them in place while MD Nichrome holds its own against the wild lettering.</p>

<blockquote>As an official global partner of Euro 2024 and Copa América 2024, and a sponsor for sports teams big and small around the world, the new Betano logo was designed with the brand’s primary marketing strategies in mind. We created the logo to light up stadium LEDs on the biggest stage and to serve as a jersey sponsor that fans are proud to wear, from the stadium to the streets.</blockquote><h3><a href="https://www.nomadstudio.com/work/betano" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nomad project page</a></h3>

<p>Additionally, the logo also has to look corporate enough to live on jerseys and stadium graphics as a sponsor, it has to look as serious as bank or airline logos; and it has to not look completely out of place in these instances. Once more, this identity succeeds. Bonus points for the glitchy bolt pattern animations.</p>

                                            <p>We have finalized the speaker line-up for the inaugural <a href="https://underconsideration.com/inhouseinfocus/inperson/in2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">In-house In-focus In-person conference</a> taking place March 27 &amp; 28, 2025 in Dallas, TX, and we could not be more excited for it but we are not quite ready to share it yet as we are putting the finishing touches on the website.</p>

<p>This means you have until Sunday, September 8, to register for in-person attendance at the lowest possible rate of $450. Price will go up to $550 on September 9 and only 250 in-person registrations will be available at that price. Remote Access pricing will remain the same at $350 throughout the registration period and there is unlimited capacity.</p>

<p>If you are even mildly considering attending, we are feeling humbly confident you will not regret purchasing at pre-sale prices and taking a gamble on the line-up but, if you need some teasers… we have speakers from one of the most visited museums in New York, one of the biggest retailers in the U.S., one of the most consumed beverages in the world along with speakers from a government agency we all have an affinity for, an NBA team, a professional women&#8217;s sports league, a small candy shop, an online fashion media empire, and more. Seriously, it&#8217;s epic.</p>

With a mission to facilitate 1,000,000 real-world human connections within their locations, Spacemade envisages a new world of work where people flourish in the company of others, and each connection amplifies collective potential. As the UK&#8217;s fastest-growing flexible workspace operator, Spacemade delivers bespoke design, hospitality and value to workers, businesses and property owners. Each of their spaces across London, Birmingham and Leeds is individually designed, branded and operated with the needs of the local audiences and neighbourhoods in mind.&#8221;</p>

                                            <p><strong>Relevant quote</strong><br /><em>The new branding had to captivate a wide range of audiences, each with unique needs and reasons for engaging with Spacemade. On the corporate front, it needed to appeal to investors, landlords and brokers; while on the consumer side, it had to attract a diverse mix of individuals and companies, with preferences that vary by location. The challenge was to create a brand that could seamlessly resonate with both worlds.<br /><br />Spacemade’s new logo takes the form of a simple rectangular shape built into its ‘S’, creating a shape that references the idea of an open doorway to invite people into the workspaces. The shape also looks to further underscore the idea of human connection and the opportunities for forming communities within each space. The shape can be used as a standalone icon or as a versatile framing device to house other imagery and brand photography, where it becomes a showcase for the people who use the workspaces. It also comes to life in motion graphics applications.<br /><br />Neo Grotesk font Aeonik’s bold weight in all caps is used for the headlines thanks to the way it “exudes a direct and simple tone of voice,” according to  Allnutt. Body copy uses clean, modern font Fakt to ensure readability across various applications and scales; while industrial-inspired Apercu Mono by Colophon foundry in all-caps is used for supporting copy such as addresses and signage to establish a strong yet approachable tone.<br /><br />The colour palette uses a variety of tones including eye-catchingly vibrant yellow, peach, and teal, with supporting black and off-white to reflect the brand’s energetic, forward-thinking and engaging approach and its new tone of voice, which is friendly, confident and welcoming.

                                            <p><strong>Opinion</strong><br />
                                            The old logo was relatively okay with an “s” monogram that looked modular and perhaps floor-plan-y and, depending on your tolerance for unnecessary typographic modifications, the old wordmark was fine or not fine, with its sharpened curve descenders and ascenders. Sign me up for the not fine. The new logo shifts to a wordmark-only approach and introduces a nice, structural-looking sans serif with a clever twist on the “S” that embeds a space in its negative space to make it more distinctive but without sacrificing readability. (At least at large sizes — in the video where it cycles through the property logos and the Spacemade logo is used small underneath, it starts to read as “PACEMADE”.) The one small drawback to this is that the “S” ends up looking narrower and lighter in density than the rest of the letters. The overshoot on both the “S” and “C” is also way too small, which would have probably helped the “S” feel a little bigger. Nonetheless, the logo makes a strong first impression and has an easy-to-decode visual puzzle that plays off of the name.<span></span> The “S” now also has the ability to stand on its own as a distinctive monogram and it works really well in that role. I also like how it then informs the layouts by using its negative space when rotated to yield a series of angled holding shapes to house information and lay over photography. For the typography, the identity adopts <a href="https://cotypefoundry.com/our-fonts/aeonik/" target="_blank">Aeonik</a> as the primary typeface and it changes the vibe from what the logo had established, losing its industriousness and starting to look more like a real estate company. The secondary <a href="https://www.typeby.com/fonts/fakt-mono" target="_blank">Fakt Mono</a> adds yet another very distinct typographic voice, especially when used in such large point sizes — in general, unless the monospace font is the headline font, monospaces work their best at small sizes. The color palette is quite nice even if the names are trying a little too hard. Not a whole lot in application and what's there feels a little unfinished… like, each individual layout is incomplete, missing important information. Overall, there is a strong premise and foundation in the logo and standalone “S” that yields some interesting bits to construct layouts but it needs a proverbial rug that really ties the room together.</p>
