                                            <p><strong>Relevant quote</strong><br /><em>Our task was to help reinvigorate the vertically integrated brand as it shifted from the California market to becoming a multi-state operator competing on the national level. They also needed to revamp their labeling system, not only for different state regulations and requirements but also to consistently communicate and educate a broader audience around product attributes and flavor profiles.<br /><br />We completely overhauled the brand identity using its core equities, turning it into a fully fledged brand system that boldly stands out on shelf. Given your typical dispensary's highly chaotic and cluttered nature, it was critical to design something memorable and approachable. Knowing this, we only slightly modified the brand's molecule logo for the sake of recognition. Building on a refined color palette anchored in the brand's historic use of purple, we introduced an audacious attention-grabbing red logo system to draw the eye and complement our purples. For typography, we used Dia Type Extended Bold, which gives the brand a confident voice when it visually shows up in the world.<br /><br />Purple had always been a part of the THCD identity, but never in a way that planted a flag and took ownership of the color. For the new identity, we leaned on a spectrum of purples for instant shelf appeal, as it could pull an audience in regardless of age or gender. That was critical for the packaging as well. The subtle shifts in our shades of purples allowed us to create distinction across SKUs while maintaining a unified standout presence on shelf.

                                            <p><strong>Opinion</strong><br />
                                            The old logo was a little sad, with its strain molecule icon looking rather anemic and the wordmark making very little effort at all in being interesting. It all felt more like a boring diagram in a chemistry high school book than a purveyor of cannabis. The new logo maintains the molecule icon but makes it a little more interesting by shortening the connecting lines and then making them blurpy for a chunkier, gooey-er look, which then extends into the wordmark that is tightly typeset in a condensed sans serif and, in the places where the letters intersect, the same blurpy treatment is applied. The visual effect is a nice representation of the actual effect cannabis has, where reality loses some of its sharp definition and things feel… softer. The use of the logo in red on top of the dark purple gives the identity a bit of an edge visually but also helps establish a strong color palette to build its brand around.<span></span> The packaging and identity build upon that color palette with a range of purples and red as the accent while introducing <a href="https://abcdinamo.com/typefaces/diatype" target="_blank">Dia Type Extended</a> as the primary typeface, which is a little too wide for my taste and that I'm not sure pairs so well with the gooey logo but, in principle, nothing wrong with it. Another element to the identity is a bento-box-y delivery of information, graphics, and photography. The highlight is the packaging system, putting to good use the range of purples across the different materials and containers — I particularly appreciate the light purple plastic baggies — with the red brightly popping off on all of them. The advertising and social media stuff is fine… I'm still not super fond of the extended sans serif and the photography is all over the place without a clear vibe of whether it wants to be hip and street-ish or high-end or sophisticated or mellow. Overall, it's definitely a punchy identity with a great color system and the boldness and simplicity of the packaging system will surely deliver a strong shelf presence in dispensaries, where it's an everything-goes, free-for-all onslaught of graphics.</p>

<img decoding="async" src="https://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/friday_likes_elcolmo.jpg" alt="El Colmo by Estudio Nuar" />

<p style="margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;"><a href="https://www.instagram.com/elcolmo_ok/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">El Colmo</a> is a sandwich shop (and bakery) in Buenos Aires, Argentina, headed by renowned chef <a href="https://www.instagram.com/arielrodriguezpalacios/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ariel Rodriguez Palacios</a>, where they marry haute cuisine with the venerable sandwich format. The identity, designed by local firm <a href="https://estudionuar.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Estudio Nuar</a>, is aesthetically informed by the lovely Art Deco interiors of the restaurant itself and conceptually by the origins of the sandwich, which is credited to John Montagu, the 4th Earl of Sandwich in eighteenth-century England, who was an avid gambler and in order to keep playing cards while enjoying his meats and cheeses he ordered to have them put between bread so his fingers would stay clean. Hence, the identity is infused with playing cards motifs, all executed in the aforementioned Art Deco style in a lovely color palette of blue, red, and gold punctuated by a great logo in a geometric sans serif. An ace in the pocket. <span class="pagination_divider"></span><span class="small_caps"><a href="https://www.behance.net/gallery/221660173/El-Colmo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">See full project</a></span></p>

<h1 class="friday_likes">Elisa Café by Piau</h1>
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/friday_likes_elisa.jpg" alt="Elisa Café by Piau" />

<p style="margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;"><a href="https://www.instagram.com/elisa.cafe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Elisa Café</a> is a coffee roaster and coffee shop with three locations in Belo Horizonte, Brazil. The identity, designed by local firm <a href="https://piau.cc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Piau</a>, introduces a charming script wordmark with some rather smooth vector work on those curves, capturing the essence of the brush strokes but delivering them as crisply as possible. The logo is supported by some groovy abstract compositions mixing straight lines with squiggly, curvy ones for a rather unique visual language. The designers explain these as being inspired by “the idea that each harvest, cup and sip is a living equation, composed of variables such as time, technique and sensitivity, resulting in something unique each time” which in turn “symbolize this essential characteristic of coffee and its capacity for transformation”. While they had me at green and black squiggles, this also works. <span class="pagination_divider"></span><span class="small_caps"><a href="https://www.behance.net/gallery/223254859/Elisa-Caf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">See full project</a></span>

<h1 class="friday_likes">Halt by Folk Estudio</h1>
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/friday_likes_halt.jpg" alt="Halt by Folk Estudio" />

<p style="margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:30px!important;"><a href="https://www.instagram.com/halt.qa/?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Halt</a> is an eatery and café in Doha, Qatar, serving lunch, coffee, and pastries. The identity, designed by Bogotá, Colombia-based <a href="https://folk-estudio.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Folk Estudio</a>, is inspired by the architectural arches commonly found across the Middle East, which translate into a logo that takes advantage of having two crossbars sitting directly next to each other to form an arch across the “H” and the “A”, rendered in a slender, condensed sans serif. I&#8217;m not sure the period was needed at the end but it&#8217;s not bad either. The applications are fairly straightforward and simple, which give the identity a subtle sense of sophistication although they also seem to <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DD2H0NDs94R/?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have a bit of fun and take some liberties</a> with the logo and green color palette. Now, if we could just redirect that pouring of melted chocolate straight into my mouth, I&#8217;d be most appreciative. <span class="pagination_divider"></span><span class="small_caps"><a href="https://folk-estudio.com/projects/halt" target="_blank" rel="noopener">See full project</a></span></p>

                                            <p><strong>Relevant quote</strong><br /><em>The Hartford wanted to develop a brand strategy that would resonate with today’s consumers and emphasize agility, clarity and connection. For Pentagram, the challenge was using the company’s heritage to help inform the future. The positioning highlights the attributes of trust, strength and stability, but with a visual language that is streamlined and contemporary.<br /><br />The stag remains the centerpiece of The Hartford’s identity, but in a more dynamic way. For the designers, the goal was to bring the stag to life and signal that the brand is full of possibility. In the past it has been treated as a mostly static asset, evolving almost imperceptibly. The update modernizes the symbol into a simplified silhouette with dimensional details that improves legibility across different scales and both digital and physical contexts.<br /><br />The new logo appears in black — strong, bold and elegantly simple. The design moves the stag to the front of the mark, where the majestic pose shows him protectively looking over his herd and gazing confidently into the future, signaling the innovation and forward progression of the company. The wordmark has been shifted from all caps of the previous identity to a more approachable upper and lower case, still retaining a sense of gravitas.<br /><br />The previous branding elements, including the stag, were used in rigid ways that aimed for visual consistency but ultimately felt constrained. With the rebrand, the designers wanted to treat the components more dynamically, permitting a broader, more diverse range of expression without sacrificing rigor or coherence.<br /><br />Other components of the system are also derived from the company’s graphic heritage, but in a modern way. This includes a bespoke typeface, Trust Hartford, a customized cut of Trust (originally designed by Jeremy Mickel) that is based on lettering on US coins. (The font coincidentally had the perfect name, given the brand strategy.) Adjustments were made to increase readability of several characters and numerals.

                                            <p><strong>Opinion</strong><br />
                                            Keeping the stag as an icon was probably the easiest decision ever made in a boardroom between client and designer, especially when it's been used for more than 120 years. In that span of time, the stag's representation has slowly evolved in abstraction from its photorealistic beginnings and this last iteration is the most minimalist expression yet. As a 15-year customer of The Hartford — our business and event insurance is through them — I have certainly grown accustomed to the old logo but I've never found it to be particularly good… the stag's face looked more like a sheep's face and the detail of his fur also made it look too fluffy. These were curvy, organic details that were in stark contrast to the sharp, angular antlers. The sky behind the stag was kind of interesting as a framing device and to add some depth to the composition but ultimately it was unnecessary.<span></span> Perhaps the most controversial aspect of this redesign is flipping the direction of the stag's body, where his rear has always been on the left side but what stays consistent is the stag's sight staring to the right and we all know that any logo with a face or animal involved has to be looking right to signal forward momentum and looking to the future. Looking back is never good. In the old logo the stag's body language was more passive and like it had reached a summit and had become complacent in its achievements but with the new composition, the stag is more alert and looking for something else, off in the distance, which I think is more subconsciously interesting. It also gives the composition more tension by having the body moving in one direction and the head in another. Execution-wise, the stag now looks stronger and sharper, with the antlers being the biggest improvement, looking more majestic and the overall high-contrast effect is nicely achieved. The one tiny objection I have is the stag's front legs that ended up looking too stiff and straight.<span></span> The wordmark is a great evolution too… the old type was perfectly fine but it's hard to beat a properly done flared serif and the existing <a href="https://mckltype.com/trust" target="_blank">Trust</a> by MCKL Type is a perfect match for the illustration while also conveying the centuries-old provenance of the company. Aside from a lovely color palette that establishes burgundy and black with a bright pink accent as the primary colors, the identity is a little lackluster and sparse. The customized Trust type works well and I like the contrast of it used in burgundy and pink with the logo in black but it's definitely missing something to bring the layouts together somehow and it's certainly not the illustrations that is going to do it. Those are probably the biggest misstep in this whole effort… they look far too much like children's book illustrations or educational aids. They are at odds with the rest of the elegant identity and, personally, for the amount of money I give The Hartford to protect me in case I chose to burn down a venue, I would expect at least a nice black and white engraving. But I digress. Overall (and illustrations aside), this is a solid evolution that makes The Hartford look more confident and poised while adding just enough vibrancy and liveliness through the color palette to keep some forward momentum and match the stag's gaze.</p>

                                            <p>Founded in 1993, Norwegian Air Shuttle ASA &#8211; better known as <a href="https://www.norwegian.com/us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Norwegian</a> &#8211; is a budget airline headquartered in Fornebu, Norway. Beginning life as a regional budget affair catering to western Norway with three planes, Norwegian grew steadily over their first few decades. At their peak in 2018, they were the largest airline in Scandinavia with 165 planes and routes spanning over 50 international destinations, including intercontinental flights to Asia and North America.</p>

<p>But then the COVID pandemic did what it did to the aviation industry. In 2020 they laid off over 7,000 workers, sold off many of their planes, and ended their intercontinental operations to focus on a reduced European network. Despite keeping to the confines of the European continent, the airline is currently on the upswing. Following a purchase of 50 Boeing 737 MAX 8 planes in 2022 and the regional Norwegian carrier Widerøe in 2024, Norwegian is creeping back up the charts, and today they occupy the rank of 10th largest European airline by passenger volume.</p>

<p>The new brand and identity was developed by <a href="https://try.no/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TRY Design</a>, which itself is based out of Oslo, Norway.</p>

<blockquote>
Instead of relying on traditional Norwegian symbols and clichés such as trolls and vikings, the identity conveys a modern, progressive Norway that balances the company&#8217;s Norwegian heritage with international appeal. The identity has effectively positioned Norwegian as a responsible and modern player in a polarized market, with a visual expression that resonates with an international audience.

<p>The previous identity system was introduced in 2002, but it had a straightforward quality that kept it from aging beyond the expected wear-and-tear of a 20-year run. Not every shade of red is consistent and there are a handful of typographic missteps. The biggest nit I can find to pick is the plane icon &#8211; back in the days before social media profile pics you could get away with those kinds of massive, useless swoops and a &#8220;.com&#8221; in the lockup. To their credit, even when the system had to bend or break to accommodate shifting usages, it was never terrible. You can see how folks could get attached to the brand, or at the very least could get used to it.</p>

<p>The new identity was introduced back in 2024 and has only just recently completed its rollout. It isn&#8217;t much of a departure from the old system, keeping all the elements and sprucing them up. The wordmark is done up in a custom typeface that we&#8217;ll get into in more detail below, but the overall impression it gives is lighter, more vertical, more modern than its predecessor.</p>

<p>The biggest glow-up is the new plane icon. Carrying on all the equity of the previous aircraft + swoop mark, the new solution manages to compress it all down into an easily digestible icon. Despite abstracting away the tail fin, condensing everything into a 1:1 footprint, and flattening the two-tone solution into a one-color mark &#8211; the strong shape language of the nose and wings still convey &#8220;airplane&#8221; with perfect clarity.</p>

<figcaption>Sonic brand. Unmute for audio.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>I&#8217;m a graphic designer, not an audio engineer, so I&#8217;m not sure I have the expertise to properly critique the craft of the sound above. But sonic branding is still branding and something about this sting just hits my ears wrong. Developed in partnership with <a herf="https://plan8.se/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Plan8</a>, &#8220;Nor-Wheeeeee&#8230;Gein&#8221; is a fun read, holding on the middle syllable and going high and airy with it. There&#8217;s an extra layer of dimensional audio for stereo listeners as the voice starts in the left and travels to the right. The idea behind the sound is conceptually very sound.</p>

<p>But there&#8217;s a bit of turbulence in the later half of the &#8220;whee,&#8221; right at the moment where the audio shows up in the right speaker. The volume shifts and voice catches slightly and it just throws the whole thing off. This hiccup doesn&#8217;t show up later in the brand overview, but neither does the binaural sweep from left to right. My best guess is that this is an artifact made after Plan8 handed the audio off to Try, a sloppy cut by another graphic designer who isn&#8217;t an audio engineer.</p>

<figcaption>Typography.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The gravity well surrounding Helvetica is nigh inescapable for brands that want to give off a Nordic vibe, so it&#8217;s actually quite remarkable how much personality that type-design partner <a href="https://kanonfoundry.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kanon Foundry</a> was able to mash into this particular custom take on the neo-grotesque format. Norwegian Display is played straight for the most part, with gentle arcs built into each diagonal. It&#8217;s a subtle but solid effect that brings to mind the gentle arcs you see in stylized <a href="https://www.google.com/search?udm=2&#038;q=flight+path+map" target="_blank" rel="noopener">flight path maps</a>. The wordmark showcases this nicely with the &#8220;w&#8221;. I like the way the capital &#8220;N&#8221; looks in the type specimen above, but I can see how it might be one quirk too many if it appeared in the main logo. Given the legacy lowercase wordmark, though, it&#8217;s entirely possible that a capital &#8220;N&#8221; was never on the table.</p>

<figcaption>Icons.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>I&#8217;m really digging the icons. Just like the small aviation aesthetic touches in the typography, the icons are reminiscent of the wayfinding you&#8217;d see in an airport, where the symbols need to remain decipherable against a cacophony of visual noise at a distance by people who may or may not speak the language. The qualities that make the icons clear and concise at a distance still hold up in the quieter, closer format of a phone screen.</p>

<figcaption>Illustrations.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The illustrations lose me a bit, if only because I can&#8217;t find any sort of flight metaphor that elevates these about the typical big-limbed, blank-faced corporate memphis style. In an identity that&#8217;s taking so many design decisions and making them just a bit more bespoke, I don&#8217;t see anything special about the set on display here. No marks against it &#8211; the characters are functional enough and they add a note of playful flexibility to an otherwise very stoic system. But they&#8217;re nothing to write home about.</p>

<p>Holding all the pieces together is a system of squares and rectangles, framing centered text, and straight-on photographs. They don&#8217;t add much, but they do allow for some big type over some nice travel pics. Another choice that&#8217;s more functional than exciting, but I&#8217;m gonna tally this one up in the positive column, if only because I&#8217;m still flying high on that typography and this system does nothing but let it soar.</p>

<figcaption>Livery.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>As bold and beautiful as the livery is, its most distinctive trait is the red nose, which was lifted directly from the <a href="Norwegian2024_OldLivery.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">old livery</a>. Of note is the decision to drop the tail fin illustrations, which originally featured famous figures from Norway but at a certain point it seems like the concept got away from them. The Norwegian Olympian and film star Sonja Henie wound up spread out across multiple tailfins before the roster expanded from &#8220;Famous Norwegians&#8221; to &#8220;Famous Scandinavians&#8221; to just &#8220;Famous Humans&#8221; with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Norwegian_Air_Shuttle_tail_fin_heroes_and_fleet" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Oscar Wilde, Babe Ruth, and Marco Polo</a> being some of the later additions.</p>

<p>Planes are expensive to paint and it&#8217;s likely the faces will be sticking around for many years into the future as the new look continues to roll out, but the decision to drop the gimmick in favor of the new icon on a field of red is a solid one.</p>

<p>As well-constructed as everything is, it&#8217;s a bit underwhelming to see an airline brand done just well enough &#8211; with flight, we&#8217;ve gotten used to the ultraluxe or the loose and playful. The new Norwegian is taking the straight-forward look that carried it through its heyday and giving it a straight-forward upgrade to keep up with modern design sensibilities.</p>

<p class="end">The brand that Try Design have come up with is just the fresh coat of paint this aging airline needs to put en route to reclaim some of that world-class status that they&#8217;ve lost since the pandemic. It might not send sparks flying, but it&#8217;s a smooth ride.</p>
