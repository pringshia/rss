To boot, the initials of each product shown spell out “TESCO”. Pretty cool how strongly recognizable the dashed lines alone are.

The iconic logo, inspired by various lipstick shapes, features a cute, organic heart symbol that resonates with Gen Z.<br /><br />In collaboration with ABC Dinamo, we developed a custom typeface—Sugar Ginto Nord Black—infused with details that mirror the lipstick’s iconic shape.<br /><br />Sugarplum’s brand voice is fresh, trendy, and always in tune with the latest social media culture. Every piece of content is crafted with playful, relatable wordplay, ensuring it connects authentically with its audience.

                                            <p><strong>Opinion</strong><br />
                                            If someone had told me “I'm going to mix <a href="https://abcdinamo.com/typefaces/ginto" target="_blank">Ginto Nord</a> with the shape of a used lipstick” I would have probably said “Please don't” but the result, as evidenced by this extra fun wordmark, is surprisingly good as the various open terminals are finished off with the soft, curvy, angled contour of a lipstick. The fact that it's such a long name allows the premise to play out multiple times and it's then literally punctuated by one more lipstick contour in the exclamation point that, to boot, has a heart in it. The logo is extended into a customized version of Ginto Nord for headlines and is complemented by OH no's <a href="https://www.futurefonts.xyz/ohno/nonplus" target="_blank">Nonplus</a>, a unique stencil script that may be my favorite element of this identity.<span></span> With lipstick as the brand's flagship product, the long wordmark plays out perfectly as it spans top to bottom in the packaging. It struggles a bit when the logo has to be broken into two lines but it's still solved nicely thanks to the even number of glyphs on both lines. For some of the exterior packaging, there is a bonus background of fluffy clouds in red monotones, which makes it look like cotton candy, which extends into the color palette of pinks and reds. The supporting imagery and social media content is clearly not meant for me but also clearly knows its audience and delivers it perfectly in all its soft-focus, glittery glory. Overall, this is playful, charming, and even a little silly, all with an appropriate youthful spirit.</p>

                                            <p>Introduced to market in 1964, <a href="https://www.mountaindew.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mountain Dew</a> is a brand of soda that “exhilarates and quenches with its one-of-a-kind chuggable citrus taste”. Originally created in the 1940s by Tennessee beverage bottlers Barney and Ally Hartman, who bottled and distributed it locally, its function was as a whiskey mixer/chaser, which is what gave it its name, as &#8220;Mountain Dew&#8221; was a Scots-Irish and Southern slang term for moonshine, a homemade whiskey. PepsiCo acquired the brand in 1964 and launched it nationally and then globally while expanding its flavors and varieties, becoming <a href="https://www.pepsicopartners.com/pepsico/en/USD/PEPSICO-BRANDS/MTN-DEW%C2%AE/c/brand_mtnDew" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a $9 billion global brand and a &#8220;favorite among male millennials&#8221;</a>. Since 2009, Mountain Dew was officially marketed and sold as MTN DEW but in 2025 it will return to its full name, a new logo, and new packaging done in-house by the PepsiCo Design &amp; Innovation team.</p>
<span id="more-299186"></span>

<blockquote>The new visual identity is a fresh take on the Mountain Dew legacy to inspire the next generation of Mountain Dew drinkers. It immerses fans in the world of Mountain Dew and connects them with our brand&#8217;s history of enjoying life outside and embracing the DO THE DEW spirit. Mountain Dew is reclaiming the mountain with a new logo and visual identity that is synonymous with adventure. captures the soda&#8217;s refreshing citrus-kick, and celebrates the great outdoors and good times with friends. The new look and feel builds upon the brand&#8217;s latest marketing efforts, including the revamped DO THE DEW campaign and introduction of “The Mountain Dude,” to inspire fans to answer when the mountain is calling by gathering with their crew for a damn good time.</blockquote><h3>PepsiCo provided text</h3>

<blockquote>The new visual identity system, designed by PepsiCo Design &amp; Innovation, creates a timeless look that takes the brand into its future, and is designed to elevate the digital and physical spaces the brand plays in.<br /><br />– The new logo now features relaxed angles and citrus-inspired yellow hues to evoke the refreshing taste of drinking a can of Dew in the sunshine with friends.<br /><br />– In a callback to the brand’s roots the logo has been updated to include the year Mountain Dew was established, 1948. The brand also returned to its origins by spelling out the word &#8220;Mountain,&#8221; complete with an emblematic citrus leaf icon dotting the &#8220;i.&#8221;<br /><br />– A refreshed color palette illustrates the brand’s celebration of the great outdoors, including a new bright yellow that nods to the soda’s citrus flavor to complement the energetic greens and red.<br /><br />– To invite fans into the world of Mountain Dew, the team designed unique graphic outdoor landscapes that set the scene for each Mountain Dew flavor. These immersive flavor world landscapes are a canvas for innovation and rich storytelling about our outdoor roots.</blockquote><h3>PepsiCo provided text</h3>

<figcaption>Logo on fun image.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>From the logo evolution image it&#8217;s crystal clear to see that something drastic happened in 2005 when Mountain Dew began to adopt a more Xtreme — lack of “E” and uppercase “X” on purpose — personality and aesthetic as the brand became more associated with action sports ranging from BMX biking to snowboarding, skateboarding, and skiing eventually leading to its sponsorship of the long-running Dew Tour. These personality traits peaked in 2009, and have remained that way for a surprisingly long 15 years, when the brand dropped more than half of the letters in “Mountain” to become MTN DEW, although in those 15 years I have never heard anyone NOT call it by its full name. Anyway, the old logo was atrocious. Highly recognizable and relevantly appropriate to its market position but atrocious nonetheless with its unicase approach, extreme angling, awkward sizing relationship of the two words, and multitude of strokes.</p>

<p>With the rise of nostalgia and the fact that it has proven a financially beneficial route for many consumer brands in the past two, three years and successfully connecting with young audiences, it&#8217;s perhaps no surprise that Mountain Dew (and others to follow, I&#8217;m sure) is riding that wave and given that it has some pretty awesome graphics in its past to draw from, it&#8217;s a strategy it can easily embrace and run with for the next few years.</p>

<p>The new logo draws most heavily from the 1996 version and more subtly from the 1969 version as it embraces some of the curvature of that one. The resulting logo is quite nice, with a much better balance of the two words, a less drastic angle, and a tricky triple-letter ligature that is well done. As an authenticity mark to signal its retro provenance, the logo also adds “Est. 1948” for all the youngins who grew up with the 2000s version and will probably not believe Mountain Dew is so old. The citrus-shaped tittle is a little too cutesy somehow and I guess getting rid of the multiple strokes from the previous logo was not as easy.

<figcaption>Packaging variations.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The old packaging was kind of terrible with its exploding polygons but, like the old logo, it was also NOT wrong for its brand positioning and it was easily recognizable. The new packaging struggles to fully embrace the retro look, probably for fear of taking the aesthetic a little too far so instead it lands in a kind of no man&#8217;s land where it&#8217;s neither fully retro nor fully contemporary and where it&#8217;s neither rugged and outdoorsy nor sporty and extreme. On the can, the logo is literally stuck between two opposing vibes, neither of which is complementary to the logo. Below you have some angled mountains and trees and above you have some random lines shooting out. I mean, both are fine, I guess, but they are a weird contrast to the logo and veer away from the premise of connecting new audiences with the brand&#8217;s history.</p>

<p>The few other mock-up applications — as there is no real product, merch, our OOH to photograph yet — seem to lean into an outdoors lifestyle brand but it also feels like it&#8217;s having a hard time to let go of its Xtreme legacy so you still have some overly energetic imagery and settings that contradict the retro approach. It&#8217;s also hard to tell if the “Do the Dew” lettering is an interim solution or if it will be the one used in 2025 when this begins to roll out as that one is clearly still stuck in the 2005 visual language and works terribly alongside the new logo.</p>

</figure>

<p class="end">The “Mountain Dude” also hints at a 1960s, hippie personality that ties well with the logo and the enjoy-the-outdoors messaging but, for now, as paired with the old logo/packaging and current “Do the Dew” lettering, it&#8217;s a mess of conflicting messages. In their defense, shifting a global brand overnight is not easy so this seems like a transition and segue from one era to the next, which may be the better approach than just all of a sudden alienating the Xtreme fans the soda has enjoyed for so long. Overall, this has a solid foundation in the logo&#8217;s retro vibes but needs some stronger commitment to one aesthetic — or a range of aesthetics that mesh well together — to better convey who this new era of Mountain Dew is for.</p>

One of two professional soccer clubs in the province of Quebec alongside CF Montréal, it is owned by Isabèle Chevalier and Jean-François Crevier, led by Annie Larouche, and managed by Marinette Pichon. The club is symbolized by a blue rose, and its colors are black, blue, gold, red, and white. It currently has no fixed home ground, and will play its home games at various venues. Roses FC was founded in July 2023 by Chevalier and Crevier, who both sought involvement in the Northern Super League after its formation the previous year. It was one of the last two charter members of the league, alongside the Ottawa Rapid. The club will play its first season in 2025, with Robert Rositoiu as its head coach.&#8221; (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montreal_Roses_FC" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wikipedia</a>)</p>

                                            <p><strong>Relevant quote</strong><br /><em>From the outset, the club was created with one goal in mind—establish itself as a new model for innovation in Canadian soccer and reduce gender inequality in the sport through a brand with a bold purpose and character. To build an inclusive and inspiring movement for both young people and the community at large, the team consulted a number of individuals from all spheres, not just diehard soccer fans. With this enlightened global perspective, the team aims to offer women and girls the opportunity to dream and strive for a career in the world of sports.<br /><br />The name “Roses” is inspired by several powerful elements, including the city of Montreal’s floral logo. The somewhat mythical blue rose is a symbol for making the impossible possible and embodies power, passion and progress. It stands for the city’s creative spirit and its diversity of cultures. The shield conveys a warrior’s spirit and the ability to remain steadfast and strong on the field. <br /><br />The abbreviation “MTL” brings a touch of modernity and local pop culture to the emblem, while the label “FC” is internationally renowned and anchors the team in the worldwide soccer community. Together, these elements reflect the energy that undeniably emanates from the city and its communities, drawing inspiration from its heritage to pave a new road to the future. <br /><br />The typography is reminiscent of a rose’s thorny stem and the letters from the iconic Farine Five Roses sign in Montreal. This assertive font gives power and presence to the club and its voice.

                                            <p><strong>Opinion</strong><br />
                                            With Roses as the club's name, it seems like it would be nearly impossible to represent it in a competitive way given that, for better or worse, roses are associated with cheesy romance and Valentine's Day, often accompanied by teddy bears. Cossette and GRDN have been able to do just that though, mostly thanks to the excellent custom typeface that transforms the relatively typical industrial, octagonal-font aesthetic used in sports into something more unique as it embeds the style with a thorny contour. The word “ROSES” looks particularly good in it but, as you browse through the team's website or <a href="https://www.instagram.com/rosesmtlfc" target="_blank">Instagram account</a>, it adds an elegant aggressive flair (and flare) to the identity, even if that's a bit of an oxymoron. The extra light weights of the variable font are all kinds of bad-ass.<span></span> The rose icon is nice and well executed but I wish it was a little more angular to match the energy of the wordmark. Granted, that could be too much of a good thing. Even though it's a pleasant composition, the sizing relationship between the two elements makes the rose look giant and leaves the wordmark feeling small. Secondary logos will satisfy wordmark and icon fans alike as each element can stand on its own. Not a whole lot in application — and even though I highlighted the team's Insta account, the visual language is all over the place at the moment — but plenty of merch to ogle at and it's pretty fantastic. The color palette can be somewhat confusing though, as the primary combo is blue and gold but then they also combine blue and red (with hints of gold) and that sort of changes dramatically the color association to the team. I mean, I dig the blue and red combos but it starts to feel like that's another team altogether. Nonetheless, give me the socks in every color. Overall, a great logo that sets a tone of duality where the team can oscillate between more and less edgy, more and less aggressive, and more and less elegant while generating plenty of fan excitement.</p>

Established in 2000, it markets itself as the first and only service in the UK to provide a comprehensive multi-agency credit report. By gathering information from all four leading credit agencies (Experian, Equifax, TransUnion and Crediva), Checkmyfile offers an up-to-date and detailed report on one&#8217;s credit history and status. This saves much of the legwork of having to check, identify and correct errors from each credit report individually, all in a paid-for subscription service. In 2024, Checkmyfile worked with London, UK-based <a href="https://raggededge.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ragged Edge</a> on a new logo and identity.</p><span id="more-299127"></span>

Between the dated color combination and the generic photography, the influence of &#8216;corporate&#8217; and &#8216;reporting&#8217; are felt. And, maybe that eye is what some of you want when peeking at their credit score, but I would bet most people would rather have something a bit more encouraging.</p>

<p>The one attempt to soften the identity falls flat. Informalizing, &#8220;checkmyfile&#8221; to be all lowercase hints at a casual tone. But, it also leads to uncomfortable starts of sentences (and is horrible for autocorrect).</p>

<p>The new logo presents the name in a friendly typeface with chunky serifs and heavy ink traps. I like it. There is a nice rhythm in reading the name, and the modified &#8220;f&#8221; gives it a small quirk. The spacing becomes more important as it moves to one color, and a bit more letterspacing might&#8217;ve avoided the kerning appearing looser in the &#8220;heck&#8221; run. Everything else is fittingly tight. But other than that, it is much improved. The initial capitalization formalizes the name and sets up the new mark.</p>

<p>I have mixed feelings about the mark. The C-shaped graphic does reference the old logo, as well as abstractly signal movement and convergence which kinda relates, but it feels like it wants to be more. Or rather, I want it to be more. Particularly when it appears by itself, I struggle to think Checkmyfile. I know we can get into the whole a-logo-is-just-a-container line of thinking, but my first reaction is that it works alright with the logo, but not by itself.</p>

<blockquote>
To change how people felt about checking their credit score, we reimagined the way the industry presents it. So we replaced the current dial, with its ever-present dread of red, with a more uplifting scale: The Credit Steps. A vibrant spectrum where even low numbers feel like they’ve got a bright future ahead of them.
<br /><br />
The Credit Steps, and that feeling of steady progress, now live through every brand element, from a visualisation of your score to an iconic mnemonic, signposting through to sign-up forms.

<p>The most exciting change for me is the &#8220;Credit Step&#8221;. Allowing it to inform the new color palette is really satisfying. The red, yellow, green are replaced with a yellow-orange-pink gradient that provides a softer place wherever your score lands. I know I have seen gradient bands before, but this application feels really smart. The secondary set of colors are a nice complement to the primary brand colors.</p>

<p>The icon set, button design and score counter start to setup the rest of the identity. The combination of black information over colors will continue throughout.</p>

<p>Key illustrations by <a href="https://lantruong.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lan Truong</a> come in two flavors. Vector graphics provide simple image references that have quick celebratory motion. Illustrated scenes offer a more detailed counterpoint that soften the overall identity. The subtle textures and hand-drawn line work feel nice, optimistic. Again it is nothing we haven&#8217;t seen before, but it just seems to work here. I also appreciate that the illustrations follow lockstep with the color palette and the two illustration styles really do feel like an extension of each other. It can be difficult to mix two looks without them feeling like they are in competition.</p>

<p>As the identity comes together, the new tone of voice emerges. And this is were everything really begins to jell into something that feels strong yet gentle. That personal touch that was missing in the old identity is satisfied. I like that Checkmyfile was able to accomplish this without a character as spokesperson. Instead, their &#8220;The Mentor&#8221; voice fills the role with a guiding touch.</p>

<blockquote>
Checkmyfile was the first company that made credit reports accessible online, so it’s time their digital experience set the standard. We overhauled the website and product, connecting the dots between your credit score and report in one tidy ‘file’ — now a single, simplified dashboard that makes everything more manageable and, importantly, more impactful.

<p>Both the desktop and mobile sites bring the visual identity to their fullness as they help show &#8216;one tidy file&#8217; (a name that does cement the Checkmyfile name). This creates sites that feel like your information is easy-to-read and access. Obviously this is the main touchpoint for customers so they are going to throw everything at it, yet they manage to fold in the colors, icons and illustrations without feeling overwhelming.</p>

<p>The advertising keeps things simple with straightforward messages. I wonder what they might feel like if the messages were paired with some of the beautiful illustrations as larger-than-life graphics. But the simple designs work too. They just feel a little underwhelming, like they are missing something. Maybe it&#8217;s that they start to feel too design-led with the gradients. But I imagine people encountering the ads are familiar with the brand, so it could me my own unfamiliarity that is causing me pause.</p>

<p>The sign is beautiful. Enough said.</p>

<p class="end">A brand that was sorely lacking in tone now has a voice. It is personable, fun and feels absolutely spot on for the industry. Displaying personal information is a tricky, sticky issue. Yet, the colors and illustrations offer a fresh take and the identity does just enough to feel motivational and&#8230; dare I say, fun.</p>
