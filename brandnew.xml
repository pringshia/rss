A small family business that has been interested in beer culture for a long time and after trying many types of beer, a direction was discovered &#8211; especially hoppy beer, which allows you to reveal the natural taste of beer and the aroma of exotic fruits in one. The production of this beer requires expensive hops of a specific type, deep experience, and detailed precision. It was this path of practice and precision, as well as the long search for taste, that became the starting point for the identity style.&#8221;</p>

                                            <p><strong>Relevant quote</strong><br /><em>This is how Basker came to life—a beer that invites everyone to become a beer discoverer. The name, derived from the English verb “to bask in something,” conveys a sense of pleasure and peacefulness, which is reflected both in the taste and the subtle design. The visual identity emphasizes the personal connection between the maker and the consumer—hand-drawn taste palettes symbolize the brewer’s wish to share knowledge and quality with others. Amidst the bold and loud labels of competitors, Basker stands out with its clear and understated packaging colors, such as ivory and lilac. The product’s name and technical details, presented in black font, take center stage, capturing the taster’s attention. A unified product system provides an opportunity to explore different flavors under a single, cohesive identity—Basker.

                                            <p><strong>Opinion</strong><br />
                                            It's rare that I find myself attracted to and displeased with a logo in equal amounts but this is where I'm at on this one. The random italicization of the letters and the forced ligatures are irritating, visually unpleasant, and even badly executed but, at the same time, there is something attractive and engaging between those harsh contrasts and the overall texture of the logo that's kind of interesting and, perhaps, it's the hand-drawn “Brewing Co.” that helps bring it all together as being fun, loose, and not to be taken so seriously.<span></span> The handwritten approach extends nicely into the labels with the name of each beer rendered in the same style and contrasted with a rather mechanical-looking monospace font, <a href="https://lettersfromsweden.se/font/ivar-mono/" target="_blank">Ivar Mono</a>, that, with its serif style adds yet another typographic flavor into the mix. Like the logo, I'm not sure if I love it or hate it but it's certainly different and unique. The color palette is also somewhat unexpected for a beer and the all-black design works great on the muted tones. One cool detail about the labels is the taste notes diagram in the back that starts out all serious and geometric and then each taste category is filled in with a pencil scribble. Overall, there may be one too many typographic gestures and styles packed into a single label but this kind of erratic-on-purpose design approach is entertaining to look at and with Basker being a microbrewery it's a funky, experimental approach they can get away with.

<p style="margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;"><a href="https://www.instagram.com/by.sunrise/?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sunrise</a> is a café in Riyadh, Saudi Aurabia, offering a selection of coffee beverages, pastries, and other sweet treats, all from <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/%D8%B5%D9%86+%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%8A%D8%B2+%D9%83%D8%A7%D9%81%D9%8A%D9%87%E2%80%AD/@26.4092748,43.932672,3a,75y,90t/data=!3m8!1e2!3m6!1sAF1QipOllm_WbxstkiAOQnpU_h-CBnBsn0mI6bggaJGO!2e10!3e12!6shttps:%2F%2Flh3.googleusercontent.com%2Fp%2FAF1QipOllm_WbxstkiAOQnpU_h-CBnBsn0mI6bggaJGO%3Dw152-h86-k-no!7i4192!8i2359!4m7!3m6!1s0x157f5704e8023873:0xdbcabdcaf4409b8b!8m2!3d26.4092008!4d43.9325066!10e5!16s%2Fg%2F11rb287z7f?hl=ar-SA&#038;entry=ttu&#038;g_ep=EgoyMDI1MDQyOS4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a cozy yet spare physical space</a>. The identity, designed by local firm <a href="https://ostudio.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OSTUDIO</a>, introduces a lovely script logo with a ginormous “S” swooping into the tiniest, tightest, roundest, chunkiest “unrise” possible. The dramatic contrast in size between the initial and the rest of the letters offers a fairly original take on the script approach and the execution is so smooth. Granted, if I didn&#8217;t know the establishment was called “Sunrise” I&#8217;m not sure I would have been able to decipher the logo but that&#8217;s an easy piece of information to acquire. I am assuming the Arabic lettering also says “Sunrise” and I really like the contrast it provides in the equivalent of a geometric sans serif. The color palette of a rusted orange, forest green, and brown with gold accents is as decadent as <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/%D8%B5%D9%86+%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%8A%D8%B2+%D9%83%D8%A7%D9%81%D9%8A%D9%87%E2%80%AD/@26.4092748,43.932672,3a,75y,90t/data=!3m8!1e2!3m6!1sCIHM0ogKEICAgID2ucqe2gE!2e10!3e12!6shttps:%2F%2Flh3.googleusercontent.com%2Fgps-cs-s%2FAC9h4no0bBf3IYn11mgw_YbFfnJJleVEUaH7Yi1YtAmDaz1Kyj3i0z3VDNE9cmTwWNKstuJssdc3j4-As1eR_zaUJaHxKa1Pttl8Qe_SxNCIWZt4bWAnL_2SHC_1CcPIJFy4NpWebxKn%3Dw203-h270-k-no!7i3024!8i4032!4m7!3m6!1s0x157f5704e8023873:0xdbcabdcaf4409b8b!8m2!3d26.4092008!4d43.9325066!10e5!16s%2Fg%2F11rb287z7f?hl=ar-SA&#038;entry=ttu&#038;g_ep=EgoyMDI1MDQyOS4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the stuffed waffles they offer</a>. <span class="pagination_divider"></span><span class="small_caps"><a href="https://www.behance.net/gallery/219223163/Sunrise" target="_blank" rel="noopener">See full project</a></span></p>

<p style="margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;"><a href="https://www.instagram.com/cleoyteo_/?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cleo y Teo</a> is a fast casual restaurant offering Mediterranean fare and is one of many establishments within a food hall called <a href="https://www.instagram.com/pannaramagdl/?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pannarama</a> in Guadalajara, Mexico. The identity, designed by local designer <a href="https://www.instagram.com/moisesvisuals/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Moisés Visuals</a>, offers a combination of an always-enjoyable reverse-stress sans serif and some charming hand-drawn illustrations (more of which can be seen at the link). It&#8217;s a fairly straightforward identity and set of elements but little details like the “Y” encased in a circle and the small illustration on the plates make this a fairly enjoyable dish. <span class="pagination_divider"></span><span class="small_caps"><a href="https://www.behance.net/gallery/224651765/Cleo-y-Teo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">See full project</a></span>

<img decoding="async" src="https://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/friday_likes_betwixt.jpg" alt="Betwixt by Pop &amp; Pac Studio" />

<p style="margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:30px!important;"><a href="https://www.instagram.com/betwixtsouthbank/?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Betwixt</a> is an Asian fusion restaurant in Melbourne, Australia. Its name does reference the seldom-used word for “between” as their approach to their menu is a mix “betwixt” Japanese and Western. The identity, designed by local firm <a href="https://www.pop-pac.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pop &amp; Pac Studio</a>, maintains that sense of ambiguity of being stuck between two things or two states or two thoughts, with a typographic approach where the words are presented in different planes and perspectives, caught somewhere between being straight and not straight, being normal and not normal. The effect is cleverly executed in the restaurant&#8217;s typographic &#8220;chandelier” where the name of the establishment is repeated in different angles. This is by no means an “easy” project to like… I think there is a certain harshness to it that may not be the most appetizing for a restaurant but I certainly appreciate the willingness to do something so unexpected and I&#8217;m a sucker for the 3D renditions of the typography displayed at the link. <span class="pagination_divider"></span><span class="small_caps"><a href="https://www.behance.net/gallery/179883979/Betwixt-Restaurant" target="_blank" rel="noopener">See full project</a></span></p>

This is the decade I spent my formative years in and included watching the entirety of <em>Saved by The Bell</em> so this spot for Chili&#8217;s featuring Kelly Kapowski (aka Tiffani Thiessen) and the defining graphic motifs of the decade coming alive feels like it was made specifically for me. Also, TIL that Chili&#8217;s sells more margaritas than any other restaurant in the U.S., which is relevant as the spot is a promotion for “<a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/chilis-celebrates-the-90s-with-tv-icon-tiffani-thiessen-and-new-margarita-of-the-month-the-radical-rita-302439388.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Radical ’Rita</a>”, Chili&#8217;s margarita of the month.

Organised by the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) and host broadcaster the Swiss Broadcasting Corporation (SRG SSR), the contest will be held at St. Jakobshalle, and will consist of two semi-finals on 13 and 15 May, and a final on 17 May 2025. The three live shows will be presented by Hazel Brugger and Sandra Studer, with Michelle Hunziker joining for the final.&#8221; (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurovision_Song_Contest_2025" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wikipedia</a>)</p>

A purpose-built grid system for design made up of hearts can be used in a plethora of ways by the event, to create images, typography, flags, symbols, lighting and more; representing people coming together around the world to experience the event.<br /><br />The identity is completed by a vibrant colour palette celebrating the life, energy and eccentricity of the event, and features a typeface designed by Swiss Typographer Ian Party - known for recently working on the widely-acclaimed new Swiss Passport design.<br /><br />The identity will be used far and wide across the event from its opening ceremony on 11th May, with comprehensive design guidelines for the identity given to local council, stage design and event partner teams. This will translate to the dressing of Basel itself including building, stadium, and tram wraps, broadcast graphics, social media content, interactive voting systems – and much more.

                                            <p><strong>Opinion</strong><br />
                                            While most <a href="https://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/tag/eurovision" target="_blank">Eurovision identities</a> sidestep the organization's actual logo and build around it, this is the first time that its hero heart graphic is not only implemented into the identity but is pretty much at the — sorry, but I have to — heart of it. What makes this even more impressive is that, in its asymmetry, wonkiness, and hand-drawn aesthetic it really isn't the easiest of graphics to work with but NOT Wieden+Kennedy has done a fantastic job activating it through a pulsing, beating grid of hearts where each unit is scaled up or down to create different compositions and treatments. <span></span> The hero graphic alone could have been enough to command attention with its swirling effect of hearts changing sizes and shifting colors but then, amazingly, they are able to turn that same grid into two-tone animations of flags waving, people running, and more, using only hearts. Those two treatments, again, could be enough but then they push it one step further with a masking effect where the patterns of hearts “dissolve” to lay over photography or video (as seen in the Instagram stories video). You would think they would stop there but even the broadcast graphics offer yet another treatment that allows for various elements to be presented on screen.<span></span> In an unexpected twist, the identity then relies on a vertiginous italic serif custom designed by Swiss type designer <a href="https://www.instagram.com/ian.party/" target="_blank">Ian Party</a>, and I say “unexpected” because I would have literally expected a sans serif to be the primary headline typeface as an easier way out and to not get in the way of the heart graphics but the italic serif ends up being a great choice that provides a contrast of harshness to the abundance of feel-good hearts. Overall, this is a great system that is perfectly suited for the opulence and theatricality of Eurovision — my main complaint is that there is not more applications to look at because this identity is wild and unhinged while somehow also being restrained and methodical and I would love to see more.</p>

                                                                    <img src="https://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/wp/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/munchies-uk_logo_before_after.png" alt="New Logo and Identity for Munchies by NCstudio" />

<a href="https://lovemunchies.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Munchies</a> is a UK-based fast food chain that opened in 2017. Since its inception, it has expanded to four more locations across Yorkshire. The restaurant offers classic American diner fare including smash burgers, chicken tenders, wings, loaded fries, and indulgent milkshakes. Following their recognition as Yorkshire and Britain&#8217;s Best Takeaway in the JustEat Restaurant Awards in 2023, Munchies worked with Manchester, England-based <a href="https://ncstudio.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NCstudio</a> on a brand refresh.
</p>
<span id="more-306557"></span>

<blockquote>
Munchies approached NCstudio … for a full brand refresh and visual uplift across their five existing locations in Sheffield and Doncaster. The brief called for a comprehensive design overhaul, including a new logo, packaging, signage, merchandise, and an interior redesign of their flagship store.

<p>
Starting with the obvious: the old Munchies identity was bad. The logo looked like it had been constructed from a free download off <a href="https://www.dafont.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DaFont.com</a>, with a star added to the &#8216;I&#8217; for good measure. The burger shape/container is rather off-putting and resembles something between a warty Pac-Man and a wacky planet. The rest of the identity wasn&#8217;t much of an identity at all, unless &#8220;loud and obnoxious&#8221; was the direction. The sad interiors, with their bleak lighting and messy counterspace, didn&#8217;t help.
</p> 

<p>
So, needless to say, any update would have been better than the original. But the new logo isn&#8217;t just better, it&#8217;s actually really great. A round, soft sans serif built into the shape of a wide, smiling mouth, with each letter forming oversized, chomping teeth, it&#8217;s satisfying without being too on-the-nose. It&#8217;s graphic, unique, and has a ton of personality. It also appears pretty thoughtfully constructed, and not just typed out and warped, which without fail creates a heinous, disproportionate effect (a criticism I agreed with for a different <a href="https://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/new_logo_and_packaging_for_munchies_by_vocabulary.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Munchies</a>!) The kerning is precise, with matching counter and joint widths. The negative space created by the &#8216;E&#8217; and &#8216;S&#8217; tapers is particularly nice. It may read as slightly illegible at first, with the stems of the &#8216;M&#8217;, &#8216;U&#8217;, and &#8216;N&#8217; blending together, but once your brain hits the &#8216;C-H&#8217;, it all comes together.

The pink and blue color palette is punchy and youthful in an early-internet kind of way, but it also immediately calls to mind the ghosts of Baskin-Robbins past. And the Y2K of it all, with the heavy drop shadows, faux stickers, and wireframe globe to boot, feels like a bit of a cop-out next to such a unique and compelling logo. Similarly, the bland Helvetica-esque typeface reads as sterile and a bit lazy. A simple sans serif is a fine choice to offset the loudness of the other elements, but perhaps a quirkier display face could have complemented the logo better, and softened the wall-of-text menu situation, allowing the typography to breathe a little.

When the elements come together in the interior design, it&#8217;s clearly very striking. The space is sleek, retro-futuristic, and genuinely beautiful. It doesn&#8217;t immediately align with the name (I associate &#8220;munchies&#8221; with the ravenous hunger you have after getting high) and reads more Jetsons than joints. But then again, space is a tried and true topic amongst high people, so maybe it actually works? Plus, moments like the &#8220;MMMMMMM&#8221; window trim are delightful, and it&#8217;s overall pretty gorgeous.

Another highlight is the neon execution of the logo above the soda machine, paired with the flavor labels beneath, which themselves resemble hungry mouths. The pairing creates a visual rhythm that is begging to be extended throughout the rest of the system. These moments hint at a more unified and distinctive identity that, disappointingly, wasn&#8217;t fully realized in other applications.

All in all, the new Munchies identity is a massive improvement, no question. But the logo is doing the heavy lifting, while the rest of the identity settles for overused &#8220;youthful&#8221; visual tropes. If NCStudio had committed to the weirdness of the logo, we could&#8217;ve had something really unique to go along with the gorgeous interior. Still, I&#8217;d happily eat here at 2 a.m. after a night out, or for a respectable afternoon lunch of burgers, fries, and Nutella/cookie dough/Snickers/Oreo milkshakes.
