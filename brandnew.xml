                                            <p><strong>Relevant quote</strong><br /><em>Despite its enviable brand awareness, many audiences still see HMH as a static textbook provider, rather than an innovator with dynamic solutions for today’s education environment. HMH needed a brand that would telegraph ​its role as a digital-first innovator, while staying relevant to the educators who know and trust the company.​[We] landed on the big idea: Growth in motion. It captures HMH’s promise to power learning that adapts to student needs and continuously identifies ways for them to make progress—in the moment and over time.<br /><br />The logo features three ovals that allude to HMH’s proven expertise in curriculum, assessment, and professional development and the relationship between students, teachers, and administrators. The shapes interact as bodies held together by mutual forces of attraction—and together the ovals move in a subtle upward trajectory in constant motion, change, and growth.<br /><br />The logo is complemented by a visual system that conveys how HMH moves, adapts, and learns to help students and teachers. It features bold visual devices that evoke how technology can fuel growth: an eye-catching, vibrant color palette, imagery that celebrates kids’ uniqueness and the heroism of teachers, clean, simple typography with a sense of personality, a contemporary illustration style, and more.

                                            <p><strong>Opinion</strong><br />
                                            I really liked the old logo, also designed by Lippincott, in how it provided a little moment of surprise by revealing a cone as the in-between step of a triangle and a circle, all while doing it in a simple 2-color combination with no gradients or shadows needed to convey the volume of the cone. As it shortened from Houghton Mifflin Harcourt to HMH at some point, the relation of three initials and three shapes was pleasing as well. The new logo takes a cue from the cone by taking its bottom oval and building a new trio of shapes to introduce a new icon. It's now a more abstract, corporate, ambiguous mark and, while it's visually fine, it feels a little empty and devoid of meaning, even if they tried by explaining that the three shapes “allude to HMH’s proven expertise in curriculum, assessment, and professional development and the relationship between students, teachers, and administrators.” It's the kind of rationalization that makes eyes roll. Its animation is pretty cool, though.<span></span> What's not cool is the new wordmark, typeset in <a href="https://www.superiortype.com/fonts/micro" target="_blank">Micro</a>, which features flat bottoms and rounded tops and is… not good. It's the mullet of sans serifs: friendly on the top and serious on the bottom. I mean, I guess it's fine but I find it very off-putting, especially when you have such an amazing symmetrical gift in “HMH” that it could be done in such a more interesting way. In fact, I keep wondering if the icon is needed at all… a logo for this company could be so much stronger with an interesting wordmark alone. The identity then doubles down on Micro as the primary typeface and it's just not a good look. The clash of rounded tops and flat bottoms as well as some angled terminals in the typeface is an uneasy combination that yields a somewhat amateurish look whereas they are clearly trying to convey a technologically advanced and digital-savvy company.<span></span> The few applications shown, even as mock-ups, feel unfinished with very basic layouts and a collection of generic photos. The illustrations skew to reflect the focus of the company on children and education and, while they are fine, they keep adding to a sort of default-ish look. One interesting element is the series of oval graphics cobbled into holding shapes. Overall, there is nothing inherently wrong with any of this but there is nothing excitingly or engagingly right either… this could have benefitted from a whole lot more contagious energy to signal the impact this brand can have on children's education and futures.</p>

                                            <p>Calgary is the largest city in the Canadian province of Alberta, with, as of 2021, a population of 1,306,784 in the city proper and a metropolitan population of 1,481,806, making it the third-largest city and fifth-largest metropolitan area in Canada. According to <a href="https://www.eiu.com/n/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Economist Intelligence Unit</a>, Calgary was ranked the number one city to live in Canada and the 3rd Most Liveable City in the World in 2022. It offers a low cost of living, low sales tax, and plenty of job opportunities as it is home to 118 of Canada’s largest corporate headquarters, a thriving film industry, and is the center of Canada’s oil and gas industry as well as offering plenty of arts and culture and approximately 8,000 hectares (20,000 acres) of parkland available for public usage and recreation. In charge of helping the city thrive is <a href="https://www.visitcalgary.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tourism Calgary</a> and <a href="https://www.calgaryeconomicdevelopment.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Calgary Economic Development</a>, both of which recently worked together to introduce a new identity designed by local firm <a href="https://www.daughtercreative.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Daughter</a>. <a href="https://www.blueskycity.ca/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A microsite</a> helps introduce the city&#8217;s new positioning.</p>

<blockquote>We created a visual language inspired by beadwork, a cross-cultural art form where individual elements come together to form something strong, beautiful, and greater than the sum of its parts — a balance of individuality and collective identity. This is reflected in a dynamic logo system, and a broader visual language of beadwork and patterning.</blockquote><h3><a href="https://www.daughtercreative.com/work/blue-sky-city" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Daughter project page</a></h3>

<figcaption>Logo family and variations.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Both of the old logos shared a wordmark, typeset in one of the most underrated bad typefaces out there, <a href="https://fonts.adobe.com/fonts/myriad" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Myriad</a>, and a tagline that made it sound and look more like that of a corporate utility. While the Economic Development wordmark stood on its own, the Tourism logo was accented by a cowboy hat as Calgary is often associated with cowboys due to a single event, the annual <a href="https://www.calgarystampede.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Calgary Stampede</a>, a world-famous rodeo and festival celebrated since 1912. Needless to say, it&#8217;s a limiting and narrow view of Calgary&#8217;s offerings and not the most broadly-appealing aspect to serve as THE icon to serve as a beacon for visitors.</p>

<p>Constructed from abstracted beads to support the rationale that beads serve as a metaphor for the city in which “Small individual elements of varying shapes and sizes, colours, and compositions come together to create a stronger, more beautiful whole” the design is bold and attractive” a primary graphic “C” has been introduced to unify their efforts. It&#8217;s a bold and attractive graphic device and, in its primary state of beads being shaped like a sun, it has a lively and optimistic presence despite the rigidity of the gridded approach to deploy the beads.</p>

<p>While there is a variety of other bead shapes, using the sun-shaped one as the primary version for the logos works great in tandem with the “Blue Sky City” moniker and with that fun color palette of light blue, white, and yellow. The wordmark, typeset in a condensed sans serif — ID anyone? — is a great complement to the condensed “C” graphic and benefits from such a unique and memorable “g”, with its ear lining up neatly with the “l”.  “BLUE SKY CITY” set in yet another sans serif is also another good complement, especially in the wordmark version with the three lines stacked and the sun at the top. In short, it&#8217;s a fun and flexible logo system.</p>

<p>The beads are certainly the main attraction and they offer a wide range of shapes, silhouettes, and contours that manage to be different enough but also remain cohesive as a family. They work equally great when mixed and matched in patterns or when the pattern is made up of a single bead style. They are also unique and interesting enough to be used as single graphic devices in certain applications.</p>

<blockquote>Our typography is big and generous, and allows us to make bold, impactful statements whilst still retaining that world-famous Calgarian friendliness and positivity. This is accompanied by a palette of bright, primary colours. These colours have an inherent simplicity with a childlike optimism and vibrance, and serve as the foundation for all other hues.</blockquote><h3><a href="https://www.daughtercreative.com/work/blue-sky-city" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Daughter project page</a></h3>

<p>For the identity, <a href="https://commercialtype.com/catalog/graphik" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Graphik</a>, in its Super weight, is used as the primary brand typeface and a simple and limited set of colors deliver everything with a bright, bold punch. There is a slight disconnect between Graphik and the logo — almost as if they are two different projects — but everything is delivered with so much confidence that it works.</p>

<p>The applications have a good range of flexibility although it could be said that it&#8217;s a little too much flexibility as some things look completely different from the others. Like, the “LOOK UP” poster constructed from beads is completely different from the poster below it with its concrete poetry arrangement. Both are great on their own but can feel like they are promoting completely different cities. Nonetheless, this does demonstrate the ability of the identity to serve different purposes by modulating the visual language to make it fit the needs and efforts of both the Tourism and the Economic Development entities.</p>

<p class="end">I was in Calgary once in the dead of winter for a quick in-and-out trip so I saw a limited range of the city, which felt a little desolate in the 48 hours I was there and it was just brutally cold too. Sunny, though! So I can attest to that. Overall, this helps present Calgary in, almost literally, a new light and it should help in attracting visitors and business or at least consider it as a viable alternative to the more popular Canadian destinations like Toronto, Montréal, and Vancouver.</p>

We expressed this new message through a refreshed brand logo - moving from red to blue - to evoke cool confidence.<br /><br />The brand position was further demonstrated through the #MaceMoment campaign concept. The PSA-style campaign blends powerful brand photography and messaging to remind people to be mindful of their surroundings and share their own #MaceMoments with others, whether it's an empty parking garage at night or jogging on a quiet park trail.<br /><br />We identified target lifestyle personas - outdoor enthusiasts, runners and young professionals - and put their needs at the center of the content marketing strategy. Leveraging new brand messaging and visuals, we updated their website and crafted new landing pages, e-newsletter templates and blog content that build stronger audience connections.

                                            <p><strong>Opinion</strong><br />
                                            I'll admit upfront that this isn't the most particularly interesting or well-presented project to get into but it's a slightly fascinating brand story (and conundrum). Like <a href="https://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/?s=my+little+pony" target="_blank">My Little Pony</a>, it's also one of those brands that I will cover no matter what, only for the continuity of covering brands one doesn't think about having evolving identities because they are so ubiquitous and un-design-y and since we covered Mace <a href="https://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/new_packaging_for_mace_done_in_house.php" target="_blank">back in 2016</a>, here we are. <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/forgotten-history-mace-designed-29-year-old-and-reinvented-police-weapon-180953239/" target="_blank">The story behind Mace® is riveting</a> and its place in the world and culture as a tool both for personal, civilian safety and for police to shower on protesters (among other, less widely broadcast uses) makes it such a conflicting product to brand, not to mention that “mace”, the word, has become the generic term for pepper spray, making it difficult for Mace®, the brand, to own its own name, which it hasn't been able to do like Kleenex or Band-aid, which are in a similar position.<span></span> With its previous design as well as its new one, what's clear is that Mace® has no idea what to do about its brand, falling in a generic purgatory that conveys nothing and makes it no more exciting or empowering than buying a stapler or a toaster. They may not actually need to try hard at all and the ubiquity of their name as a generic term generates all the sales they need so having this lackluster presence isn't really an issue but, at the same time, they are not really doing anything to combat the lack of brand awareness that they OWN and ARE “mace”. The problem is, how do you design for this? Is it a much more consumer-friendly vibe? Is it a bro-ish, tribal-tattoo vibe? Is it about safety? Is it about empowerment? Whatever it is, neither old nor new logo makes a difference.<span></span> The new logo is arguably better in that it at least hints at “spray” with its halftone pattern coming out of the “M” but that's the only interesting element in an otherwise dated and clunky logo. The packaging is a lateral step at best if not a backwards one as the information and hierarchy is non-existent. The halftone spray pattern in the background, changing colors with the product, is potentially interesting but mostly it ends up looking generic. The logo on the products <em>almost</em> begins to perhaps potentially maybe-one-day look cool but it's not there yet. Overall, this does nothing to move the brand in any direction… not forward, not backward, not even sideways, it's just spinning in place. A dusty, tired place.</p>

Founded in 2013 by Noah Lang, <a href="https://www.stridehealth.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Stride Health</a> is an insurance marketplace and self-employment resource hub designed for independent workers. Combining support for insurance, finances, and taxes in one platform, Stride has helped over 3.7 million workers save an estimated $5.4 billion on their taxes and monthly health insurance premiums since its founding. Additionally, Stride partners with companies like Uber, Amazon, DoorDash, and Instacart to provide their gig economy workforces access to Stride&#8217;s benefits platform,  delivering access to health benefits and financial planning tools. In an effort to visually showcase the breadth of their offering, Stride has introduced a refreshed logo, brand identity and website designed by New York, NY-based <a href="https://redscout.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Redscout</a>.

<blockquote>
Redscout worked with Stride Health to build a more confident brand to better serve independent workers. Their new visual identity and distinctive yellow reflects how Stride illuminates the lives and realities of these chronically overlooked workers – designed to stand out in a sea of sameness within the category.

<p>
The old logo had some definite personality but was generally pretty rough, displaying an utter disregard for Bezier curves and winning the award for the world’s most awkward “tr” ligature. The new logo remedies its most offensive flaws with a much more practical, classic cursive “r” that resolves the awkward break in the middle of the mark, a monoline stroke that makes that mark feel like a considered piece of lettering rather than a hastily live-traced signature, and a recalibrating of the “S” that necessarily drops the baseline and balances out what was previously dead space.</p>

<p>I know first hand what a slippery devil the script uppercase “S” can be, and Redscout has done a nice job making it work here (for a prime example of this exact same treatment absolutely <em>not</em> working, see <a href="https://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/new_logo_identity_and_campaign_for_stir_by_the_working_assembly.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Stir</a>). While there are a few details that maybe could have used more attention— the “e” falls a bit flat for me, and the space between the “i” the terminal of the “t” crossbar feels unresolved — it is an overall gargantuan improvement from the previous logo, and gets bonus points for maintaining personality and brand equity.

<blockquote>
The North Star we developed for Stride was to enable workers to realize the full promise of their independence. With this foundation, we also partnered together to create a brand and GTM strategy to connect with an underserved audience, a visual identity that highlights traditionally overlooked workers, and a website that brought it all together.

The identity elements are simple but play nicely together. The type system is made up of a few variations of Klim Type’s
<a href="https://klim.co.nz/collections/founders-grotesk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Founders Grotesk</a>, lending a friendly-yet-modern voice to the brand that looks and sounds like 90% of start-ups we’ve seen in the past 5 years, but I’d argue that familiarity actually works in the brand’s favor here to create a comfortable, recognizable space for its target audience (I’m thinking particularly of 
<a href="https://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/new_logo_and_identity_for_justworks_by_order.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Justworks</a>, which uses a similar type treatment and is a brand I’ve encountered regularly in my own freelancing endeavors). Accompanied by a pared down, fairly ownable palette and some <a href="https://www.instagram.com/mattblease" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Matt Blease</a>-esque illustrations, the overall tone is equal parts approachable and confident, which, in the case of this particular brand, is far more important than being hyper-memorable or boundary-pushing.

Nothing mind-blowing in the applications, but the entire brand is a prime example of how a few well-executed, thoughtful ingredients, when combined strategically, can come together to make a great end product. Were I not lucky enough to be able to mooch off my partner’s ridiculously expensive corporate health insurance policy, this is certainly the first place I’d be going for more information as a self-employed person myself (ten points to Gryffindor re:hitting the target demo, which includes not only me but also, apparently, <a href="https://www.stridehealth.com/alex" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alex Honnold</a>). 
</p>
<p class="end">
All in all, this feels like a highly necessary and very solid refresh that I suspect will last the brand a while—at least until the American people have finally had enough of the absolute racket that is health insurance in the US and collectively revolt against a deeply predatory and inhumane system that monetizes what should be a basic human right. Until then, Stride paints itself as an approachable and illuminating resource for those of us bravely attempting to navigate this capitalist hellscape on our own, and kudos to them for doing it in style.
