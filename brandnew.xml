We expose how the industries fuelling the climate crisis profit from destruction and stand with the people fighting back to defend their communities and their rights. Using cutting-edge investigative methods, we shine a light on the financial and political systems that enable corporate abuses of power that harm people and planet. We work with the people who are directly impacted to ensure they are protected from threats when speaking out, and included in climate decision-making, as the world transitions to clean energy.&#8221;</p>

                                            <p><strong>Relevant quote</strong><br /><em>Investigations by Global Witness inform the news we all consume and the impact of their campaigning is felt across the world. We supported them in solidifying their purpose: to expose how the industries fuelling the climate crisis are profiting from destruction, and to stand with the people fighting back.<br /><br />[The logo is] a universal, recognisable symbol to ‘see and speak the truth’. A logo to represent both the investigative and campaigning roles of Global Witness.<br /><br />The brand always works in service of the real human story. Flexible design tools allow it to speak with authority, or sit back and support. Everything respects the urgency of the climate crisis: not by trying to shout loudest, but by meticulously presenting hard-hitting evidence and insight.<br /><br />The new design system is grounded in an editorial-like approach that gives clarity and space to every issue. It highlights what’s important, alongside in-depth analysis – helping to make information, however complex, easier to engage with and understand.<br /><br />Font choice and typographic sensibilities are crucial to a brand that uses words to such powerful effect. The pairing of Klim Type Foundry’s modern sans ‘Founders Grotesk’ with elegant serif ‘Tiempos’, strikes a balance of personality and impact, with maturity and legibility. They’re capable of delivering serious facts and pointed opinions in equal measure, from headlines to longer reads.

                                            <p><strong>Opinion</strong><br />
                                            The icon in the old logo was kind of interesting, with a person running in different directions through a clever use of arrows. Hard to tell exactly what message it was trying to convey in relation to the name but it did manage to exude a sense of urgency, almost like a warning that you should run for your life. As I said, “interesting”… not necessarily “good” or “correct”. The new icon is both “good” — “great”, actually — and “correct”, combining an eye with a loudspeaker to easily communicate that the organization adheres by the mantra of “If you see something, say something” and, with its red color and thick lines, it also captures a sense of urgency and alert but one where it's clearer that the organization is looking out for you and acting on your behalf. The wordmark, in <a href="https://klim.co.nz/retail-fonts/founders-grotesk/" target="_blank">Founders Grotesk</a>, is fine — no additional rhapsodizing needed.<span></span> The rest of the identity is good… the recurring thick red lines are visually strong and I like that they can take on a few different forms, whether it's the minimalist icons or the speech bubble treatment in the report covers or as radiating energy from silhouetted imagery but, at times, it feels a little default-y and relying too much on Founders Grotesk and the red/black combo, which aren't particularly unique. The brand gathers some steam with the launch campaign writing and the introduction video, both of which pack a punch in terms of messaging delivered and emotions triggered — aptly deployed through the simple set of ingredients that don't get in the way. Overall, this is a solid identity and despite earlier stated opinion about it,as “default-y”, sometimes that is not a bad thing at all when design takes a back seat to, and is in support of, a strong message.</p>

<h1 class="friday_likes">FARE by Estudio Nuar</h1>
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/friday_likes_fare.jpg" alt="FARE by Estudio Nuar" />

<p style="margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;"><a href="https://www.instagram.com/farepinsa/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FARE</a>, which means “to do” in Italian, is a small chain with two locations in Buenos Aires, Argentina, serving pinsas. If like me, you thought that was an alternate spelling of pizza then today, like me, you will learn it&#8217;s actually a similar but different culinary delight that uses a blend of wheat, soy, and rice flour, and undergoes a longer fermentation process than traditional wheat flour pizza that results in fluffier dough and a more voluminous presence. I bring this all up in part because the identity, designed by local firm <a href="https://estudionuar.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Estudio Nuar</a>, revolves around a logo inspired by the pinsa&#8217;s Italian provenance and that the team describes as being “strong like a Roman column, curved like the Colosseum widows, and dusted with flour”. While none of those specific thoughts sprung to mind upon first seeing the logo it did not take away from my deep appreciation for its chunky, geometric letterforms, thin counterspaces, and tight typesetting. With the logo in place and a vibrant orange as the sole brand color, the identity simply repeats it in as many places as many times as possible with a charming script in a supporting role promoting FARE&#8217;s core offering of pinsas and vermouth. One of each, please. <span class="pagination_divider"></span><span class="small_caps"><a href="https://estudionuar.com/portfolio/fare/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">See full project</a></span></p>

<h1 class="friday_likes">The Running Bean by Chochoi Creative</h1>
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/friday_likes_runningbean.jpg" alt="The Running Bean by Chochoi Creative" />

<p style="margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;"><a href="https://www.ampersand.vn/therunningbeansg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Running Bean</a> is a less small chain of cafés with four locations in Vietnam, offering some <a href="https://isgvn-my.sharepoint.com/personal/truc_luu_ampersand_vn/_layouts/15/onedrive.aspx?id=%2Fpersonal%2Ftruc%5Fluu%5Fampersand%5Fvn%2FDocuments%2FThe%20Running%20Bean%2FMenu%20TRB%202025%2FTRB%2D2025%2DNewMenu%2DHN%2Epdf&#038;parent=%2Fpersonal%2Ftruc%5Fluu%5Fampersand%5Fvn%2FDocuments%2FThe%20Running%20Bean%2FMenu%20TRB%202025&#038;ga=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">delectable-looking</a> coffee drinks, all-day brunch, and more. The Running Bean already had the “R” monogram that looks like it&#8217;s running and it&#8217;s such a simple pleasure that can be instantly appreciated thanks to a relatively basic concept — “Hey, we are called Running Bean, let&#8217;s have a letter that looks like it&#8217;s running!” — but now, as part of the identity designed by Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam-based <a href="https://chochoicreative.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chochoi Creative</a> it sprints forward with a much more nuanced execution that adds a human touch to it. The new “R” reflects the new custom typeface that has a unique, blocky structure and very peculiar flared gestures. With those two strong elements in place, the identity can flex in a variety of ways from simple and straightforward applications like cups or tin cans to more elaborate compositions and uses of the elements like the bottled tea example. If you are in Vietnam, run, don&#8217;t walk to your nearest location. <span class="pagination_divider"></span><span class="small_caps"><a href="https://chochoicreative.com/chochoi/the-running-bean" target="_blank" rel="noopener">See full project</a></span>

<h1 class="friday_likes">Pardo by Perspectiva</h1>
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/friday_likes_pardo.jpg" alt="Pardo by Perspectiva" />

<p style="margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:30px!important;"><a href="https://www.instagram.com/pardo_ags/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pardo</a> is a single location café in the city of Aguascalientes in Mexico, slinging drinks and baked goods from a stunning, concrete-laden locale designed by <a href="https://www.instagram.com/efe_arquitectos/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">EFE Arquitectos</a>. The identity, designed by Zacatecas, Mexico-based firm <a href="https://www.behance.net/perspectivamx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Perspectiva Studio</a>, takes an equally sturdy approach with a bold wordmark that looks like it could have easily been cast from concrete as well, with strong angular lines but long, soft rounded corners. I&#8217;m always appreciative of reverse-stress typography and this one doesn&#8217;t disappoint. I like that the middle horizontal strokes are kept thin (whereas technically they should be as thick as the top and bottom ones) which gives the type some extra tension. At small sizes, I&#8217;ll admit, it can be hard to read the correct name as it can easily look like either “PARDO” or “PRADO”. Taking another cue from the architecture is the primary muted green color from the counter that looks great paired with simple black and white throughout the applications. Lastly, the custom mug with the logo debossed at the bottom looks SO good and would be the only reason not to ask for a refill. <span class="pagination_divider"></span><span class="small_caps"><a href="https://www.behance.net/gallery/219491101/PARDO" target="_blank" rel="noopener">See full project</a></span></p>

                                            <p><strong>Relevant quote</strong><br /><em>Although Dawtona is a family business of farmers, its previous packaging failed to communicate its heritage. Combined with the enigmatic name, Dawton's origin was a mystery to consumers. To make the brand stand out, the new Dawtona was brought to life, reimagined as a Slavic goddess of harvest, that embodies nature, tradition, and care. The brand now has a bold, modern look. The oval shape makes products pop on the shelf, and the new color system helps each product shine. With this transformation, Dawtona tells its real story – one of farming passion, quality, and family.

                                            <p><strong>Opinion</strong><br />
                                            The old logo was arguably fine, looking enough like a mainstream consumer product brand if perhaps not exactly suited for the tomato, vegetable, and legume category because change the color to blue or green and it instantly becomes dishwasher detergent. It was also kind of a wobbly italic with a very uneven baseline and the little opening in the “o” was unnecessary. The new logo is a drastic departure and introduces a fictional “Slavic goddess of harvest” in a very charming illustration style that manages to be both minimalist and detailed, down to the braided hair. The one detail I'm unsure of is the mouth, which I get that it's openly smiling but it looks like the only element in the illustration that is stroked instead of filled, which in turn draws attention to the eyes that look a little empty in contrast to the drawing of the mouth. Nonetheless, it makes a beautiful first impression and the typography around it looks great as it all comes together in a half circle composition. (If, like me, you were wondering… the text to the left of the name translates as “Family Business”).<span></span> While the old logo was somewhat passable, the old packaging was even less successful and had a very generic design that didn't signal any kind of quality within — it doesn't make for the best browsing experience but <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240620200224/https://dawtona.pl/produkty/" target="_blank">you can see additional old packages in an Archived page</a> beyond the one can I shared above. The new packaging is also an excellent update, making great use of the half-circle logo placed at the top of any given package structure and its label and letting the rest of the typography and photography flow down from there. While in most instances the logo is placed on a red background I actually really like how it looks on a white background (as in the canned beans products) with the illustration neatly masked/cropped inside a red field, maintaining the negative-positive balance. The new condensed sans serif and new script are a great pair and all of the supporting typography is well handled and balanced. The one outlier in all of this is the concentrate packaging that replaces the main illustration with a shiny tomato but it's still an improvement over <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240511172301im_/https://dawtona.pl/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Koncentraty-i-przeciery.png" target="_blank">the old one</a>. Overall, an undeniably positive evolution and not just by contrast to the old logo and packaging but also as an excellent best-case example in the canned, pureed, and sauced tomato category, which can get overly clichéd and repetitive.</p>

Their brand and identity were designed by Paris creative studio <a href="https://www.yorgo.co/" target="blank" rel="noopener">Yorgo&amp;Co</a>. The official origin story starts with a quote from founder Thibaud Guittard.</p>

<blockquote>“I was looking for a watch that was a complete departure in style, with a strong emotional appeal. With both a high-performance, fine-watchmaking movement, absolute comfort when worn, and a totally radical design.”<br><br>Fruit of his myriad aspirations, Thibaud gathered his ideas, mood boards, and sketches over months. Taut, elusive lines were born on paper, while a clear brand universe came to life.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>ALTO website</h3>

<span id="more-303807"></span>

<p>The alternate origin story that I just made up has noted petrolhead <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jay_Kay" target="blank" rel="noopener">Jay Kay</a> (also famous for hats and fronting Jamiroquai) drinking Pernod in an impossibly cool private club in Paris. He wonders aloud about what might be the perfect watch to wear while driving his newly-acquired, one-off 1970’s <a href="https://www.caranddriver.com/features/g15379656/doorstop-believin-27-incredible-concept-cars-of-the-wedge-era/" target="blank" rel="noopener">wedge car</a>. Thibaud Guittard is, serendipitously, also in the club and also drinking Pernod. TG overhears Jay Kay, immediately whips out his Limited Edition Caran D&#8217;Ache Crystal Lalique White fountain pen and within minutes has sketched out what will become the ALTO Art 01 on a piece of the club’s bespoke notepaper. Jay Kay is enamoured with the design. He pulls his phone from a secret compartment in his hat and transfers an eye-watering amount of money to TG t secure the first production watch for himself.</p>

<blockquote>ALTO, a new watchmaking brand, asked us to collaborate on the launch of their ground-breaking first model: ART 01. From naming consultancy, icon and wordmark design, to branding applications on the watch, we conceived a minimal and coherent visual identity to match the unique wedge-design product aesthetics.<br><br>
After working at Audemars Piguet, founder Thibaud Guittard gathered his ideal entourage to launch ALTO: Raphael Abeillon­—formerly Cartier’s watch designer—for the monobloc timepieces, Mathieu César for the stills and films, Yorgo for the icon design, Leo Walk for the choreography, and Pedro Winter for the launch event.<br><br>In addition to their innovative sapphire crystal shapes, the watches’ second hand runs in reverse.</blockquote>
<h3>Yorgo&amp;Co provided text.</h3>

<p>Jay Kay and I are <em>so hyped</em> about the backwards-moving second hand. And a little confused about the exact nature of Leo Walk&#8217;s choreography. There is no dancing in the case study. Never mind. Let&#8217;s see how this identity ticks. Here’s the icon nice and large.</p>

</figure>

<p>The alternate, likely somewhat true, inspiration for the icon: someone, perhaps Yorgo Tloupas himself, thought, <em>I bet it would look cool if you chopped the top off an “A” and fiddled with it until it stacked on itself perfectly.</em> It does look cool. It’s one of those symbols that feels like it’s always existed. Has no one done this before? (I don’t know because I spent all my research time looking at wedge cars and French pens.)</p>

<p>Before we do anything else, let’s get a perennial Brand New question out of the way. Will it [verbed noun]?</p>

<figure class="full">
    <img decoding="async" src="https://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/ALTO_icon_on_things.jpg" alt="New logo and identity for ALTO by Yorgo&amp;Co" />
    <figcaption>Almost certainly.</figcaption>
    </figure>

<p>The icon gets a couple nice animated pattern treatments. There is no evidence of their use.</p>

    <figcaption>Logo lockup.</figcaption>
    </figure>

<p>The lockup seems weird and impractical, but it turns out to be pretty much the entire identity system. It doesn’t make much sense on its own. Wait until you see it on the watch. You’re familiar with mobile-first design. What Yorgo&amp;Co have done is watch-first design.</p>

<p>The wordmark is unmodified <a href="https://optimo.ch/typefaces/theinhardt">Theinhardt</a> Medium by Optimo. I love grotesks and medium is often my favourite weight, so I’m happy. The slightly increased letter spacing makes sense for a mark that is applied at tiny sizes to a watch.</p>

<p>The brand colours are black and white. This is the correct choice.</p>

<p>The brand font is, like the wordmark, Theinhardt Medium. (For some reason the <a href="https://altowatches.com/">website</a>, not designed by Yorgo&amp;Co, uses a different wordmark and font. The site code tells me it’s “ALTO Medium” but it’s totally Gotham. The wordmark is slightly customised Gotham. Let’s try and pretend the real website is something different and better.)</p>

<p>The watch itself is where this identity gets really good. Look at how thoroughly the brand is integrated into the watches.</p>

    <figcaption>Brand identity becomes watch design.</figcaption>

<p>I love the way the logo and the two lines are part of the watch design, not merely applied to it. If 1970s minimalism had a baby with the 1980s love of labeling things and that baby was a watch, it would be this exact timepiece. It’s wonderful.</p>

<p>I do have one question though. If you were going to spend €25,500 on a wristwatch, would you be happy with a rubber strap? This is an honest question. I don&#8217;t spend that kind of money on watches, so I don&#8217;t know.</p>

<p>The photography is exactly what you would imagine before you started thinking, which is disappointing. If they had taken inspiration from the watch or the stacked icon or wedge cars or Jay Kay’s hats, they could have come up with something much more interesting. Let’s get back to the designed stuff.</p>

<p>ALTO is a beautiful example of what can be created when graphic designers and product designers collaborate. I only wish the design was fully implemented online and that the photography was more inspired. Neither of those take anything from this remarkable watch, its eternal icon, and its delightful backwards second hand. Next time you are purchasing a one-of-a-kind 1970s concept car, have your financier spot you an extra 25k so you can nab an ALTO watch to complement your new ride. Just like Jay Kay did (in my imagination).</p>
