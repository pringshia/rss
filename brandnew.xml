                                            <p><strong>Relevant quote</strong><br /><em>We created a brand idea that would act as a North Star for all other elements and touchpoints of the experience: a Force for Firsts. It reinforces the role of the University as a driving force and catalyst of positive change, creating new opportunities and propelling individuals and industries to achieve their fullest potential. From this, we crafted a compelling brand platform, manifesto and design principles that balanced our core goals of honouring legacies and tradition while looking towards the future.<br /><br />The logo is an abstract monogram inspired by the architecture of the iconic Adelaide Festival Theatre, conveying progress and momentum. The A in the composition is crafted in serif style, a reference to academia that suggests that this is a pedigreed institution. The U features a sense of upward motion which expresses energy and culminates in a shape that references the state of South Australia, a nod to the people the new university will serve. This is accompanied by a logotype in a contemporary serif font that radiates gravitas, with just enough personality to help ground the monogram.<br /><br />The colors were chosen to echo the navy blue used by both founding institutions, combined with a contemporary digital blue and an unexpected purple hue that is reminiscent of trees that blossom across South Australia, heralding the arrival of summer. The remaining visual system provides flexibility between ‘proven,’ ‘audacious’ and ‘open’—the design principles that drove the visual and verbal expression—enabling the new university to appear established when relevant and challenging when appropriate.

                                            <p><strong>Opinion</strong><br />
                                            The old logos were quite the opposite from each other, with The University of Adelaide having a fairly traditional academic crest and the University of South Australia having a fun, relatively quirky, impossible object in its shield. The only remnant of either logo is in the counter shape of the “U” in the new logo where the shield shape could be potentially seen and that's probably about the only positive thing I have to say about it.<span></span> I don't hate it but it is a very, VERY awkward “AU” abstraction with so much over-rationalization that it feels like Lippincott and FULLER were grasping at straws to justify a design that is simply not that interesting and is mostly confusing as not a single design gesture relates to the next. It's sharp in its serifs but that's about it. The extreme angle of the “A”, the loose piece of the “U” at the top, the awkward “b” shape in the counterspace… it's just odd. I mean, in terms of creating an identifiable, simple, graphic asset for the university, it succeeds. It's… memorable.<span></span> The wordmark is quite nice but that serif makes no appearances again and while the use of <a href="https://klim.co.nz/retail-fonts/national-2" target="_blank">National 2</a> is a nice complement and a strong headline typeface, not employing such a nice serif seems like a disservice. The color palette is pretty nice too, if a little conventional. The “North Terrace Purple” and “South East Limestone” are really good accents. It's early days for the university so not a whole lot in application but what's there is fine if perhaps ambiguous, not really saying much other than “Hey, we are new!”. Overall, this is arguably fine depending on how you feel about the monogram — granted, a big *depending on* — and it looks properly academic but it feels like it over promises and under delivers.</p>

To quote <a href="https://www.frommers.com/destinations/taiwan" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Frommer&#8217;s</a> (because I always have a hard time introducing destinations): &#8220;Taiwan is one of Asia&#8217;s industrial powerhouses, but its diverse natural assets and cultural attractions make it a draw for visitors as well. This small island nation is located southeast of the coast of mainland China with an eastern shore that rims the Pacific Ocean. Much of the island is lush forestland, but the topography includes picturesque mountains, rice fields, and balmy beaches.” In charge of bringing nearly 1 million tourists annually to see the picturesque mountains, rice fields, and balmy beaches is the <a href="https://eng.taiwan.net.tw/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Taiwan Tourism Administration</a>, which is part of the Tourism Administration, M.O.T.C. Republic of China (Taiwan), established in 1960. Looking to increase the number of international visitors and committed to steering the tourism industry towards sustainability and digitization and crafting superior travel experiences and pioneering services, the Administration has introduced a new identity designed by Taipei, Taiwan-based <a href="https://bito.tv/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bito</a>.</p>

<blockquote>Bito has redefined the identity of Taiwan Tourism with the concept of “WAVES OF WONDER,” symbolizing a journey full of endless surprises in Taiwan.<br /><br />The new logo draws inspiration from Taiwan‘s undulating mountains, seas, and roads. These flowing waves not only represent Taiwan’s sceneries but also the moods during travel. Compared to the mixed-case logotype in version 2.0, version 3.0‘s all-caps letters construct a more confident and powerful personality, staying classic and firm over the next decade.</blockquote><h3><a href="https://bito.tv/work/186/TAIWAN-Tourism-Rebranding" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bito project page</a></h3>

<p>The old logo, <a href="https://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/taiwan_a_heartfelt_destination.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Reviewed in the distant past of 2011</a>, was quite nice and other than the gradient I think it had aged well — like, I could see it being introduced as a new logo today and it would still feel contemporary. The new logo is a surprisingly drastic change going from one polar opposite to the next: Title case to uppercase, traditional to modern, serif to sans serif, soft and delicate to bold and in-your-face. Drawing inspiration from Taiwan&#8217;s sinuous curves in its landscapes, which I initially associated more with its many mountains instead of thinking “waves” , the new logo is a pretty awesome and bold design. It is obviously reminiscent of NASA&#8217;s worm logo so there is an inherent space-age-y-ness to it that at first feels at odds with the nature focus of the photography but its mountainous “A”s literally ground it into something more earthy. Weirdly, I am actually having a tough time verbalizing what I like about this logo and how it is appropriate by eschewing what could be typical Eastern Asia visual clichés. It&#8217;s just good. I think.</p>

<figcaption>Shapes.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>For the identity, the elements stick to the curvy/wavy approach, starting with a sans serif that echoes the logo with exaggerated rounded corners and rounded apexes (apexi?) and while it could be a good typeface for something else — like car racing or an airline — it does feel quite out of place here with its retro-futuristic look. (Although the logo operates on a similar wavelength, it is more successful in smaller doses.) As seen in the main logo animation, one recurring design element is the mono-thickness wavy line with a gradient inside which feels a little stiff and forced despite its efforts in not being either. Another interpretation of the concept is the library of shapes that come in a variety of wave contours and thicknesses and animated with a slightly frenetic pace that seems to counter the zen-like scenery that influenced the waves in the first place.</p>

<p>The applications, while technically fine, lack focus and a clear direction. It ranges from elegant, minimalist, and moody like the very first set of ads where it&#8217;s just the logo on the top along with some great photography to really cheesy and amateurish integration of elements as in the dessert picture with the wobbly wave going behind it. In between there is a wide range of executions too, none of which quite portray a unified, recognizable destination front. The Instagram posts and stories are particularly random and almost look like a whole other project — not to mention the logo animation below, which I LOVE but why? To their credit, this works mainly on the strength of the logo and power of the photography (but even that is inconsistent).</p>

<p class="end">Overall, this has a strong foundation in the logo and even the broad “wave” concept has potential but, as it stands right now, this is all flowing in one too many directions. Still, dying to visit Taiwan, so the destination kind of sells itself.</p>

                                            <p><strong>Relevant quote</strong><br /><em>The elephant that has traditionally appeared in the iconic logo is now more powerful than ever – strong in character, rich in detail, and self-confident, with subtle allusions to the original version. The elephant designed by Peter Schmidt in 1972 for a tea tin had a blanket on its back. Now, different blankets represent the agency's various offices. For example, a diamond pattern familiar from the Bavarian flag stands for Munich, while colorful azulejo tiles represent the Lisbon office. So instead of just a single, one-size-fits-all elephant, there's now an entire herd. And the wordmark combines a contemporary, sans serif font with characteristics that subtly harken back to the elephant mascot.<br /><br />While the elephant itself is drawn in a traditional style, all the other elements in the new design system are modern and forward-looking. The imagery style includes organic motifs and digital animations; the company typeface is an elegant Grotesque font specially developed by Peter Schmidt Group.<br /><br />Another new addition to the agency’s communications portfolio is a corporate sound with a strong character, developed in collaboration with sound-branding agency TRO and renowned elephant researcher Dr. Angela Stöger-Horwarth. It is based on the fact – unbeknownst to most people – that elephants communicate with one another using low-frequency sounds called “rumbles” that enable them to communicate across distances of several kilometers. TRO modified original recordings of rumbles and used them to compose a diverse set of sound elements. The corporate sound – unique among agencies and in the broader landscape as well – will support Peter Schmidt Group in its communication.

                                            I tend to avoid posting design and branding firm redesigns because even for Brand New it can be too navel-gaze-y but I found the elephant evolution fairly interesting and the contrast of its relatively classic illustration style with the glitchy motion work and sonic branding (which might be the highlight of the project) kinda cool, so let's get to it. The old logo was a lackluster literal depiction of an elephant, which made it more of a curiosity of why a branding firm would have an elephant as an icon than a cool identifying device. (The reason for the elephant is that one of the company's first projects in 1972, involved an elephant drawing by Peter Schmidt for a range of teas — not sure exactly what brand but you can see the original drawing at the :08 mark in the intro video or <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/185676846804" target="_blank">on this tin on eBay</a>.) Needless to say, the charm of the original had been lost and when paired with unexciting extended sans serif wordmark, it looked like it wasn't even trying.<span></span> The new elephant has a less cartoon-y look and brings back its blanket, which is customized to celebrate something about the culture of the city/country where each of the company's offices resides. It's a pretty nice gesture. The main problem is that the drawing of the blanket (and the elements within it) and the drawing of the elephant don't quite match so it almost feels like the elephant is a mock-up with interchangeable blankets on a smart layer. Also, if the idea is that they are now a herd of elephants instead of a single elephant, it would have been nice to have slightly different elephants. I would have also loved to see an even more detailed and nicely executed drawing of the elephant… perhaps by, say, <a href="http://www.chriswormell.com/" target="_blank">Chris Wormell</a>. Still, at first glance, it's certainly a nice evolution of the logo. The wordmark, in the company's new custom typeface is fine and a big improvement over the old one.<span></span> The identity then shifts into a few different moods, starting with the custom typeface that is nicely executed but that feels a little trendy. The primary color is That Blue and it just feels like a tired and obvious choice for a design firm. Then there are some weird background 3D graphics where it's really hard to tell what they are. Then there is the glitchy motion effects, which are fun to look at but also a bit overdone by now. As mentioned earlier, the highlight is the sonic branding that subtly incorporates actual elephant rumbles into it for a moody yet energetic vibe. Overall, it's all a bit trendy and maybe it tries too hard to showcase Peter Schmidt Group's capabilities — we can do icons! We can do custom type! We can do groovy backgrounds! We can use That Blue! — all at once but, more positively, it does convey energy, creativity, and newness.</p>

                                            <p>Kairos Group is a leading social agency for brands and creators, known for high-impact marking campaigns targeting Gen Z and video gaming audiences. Co-founded in 2015 by Chris Parnell and professional Call of Duty player Mike Craddock, they have been able to authentically tap and speak to sub and niche-communities, and provide top quality social and influencer support. The group has grown significantly over the past nine years as they continue to expand beyond their gaming origins. They acquired Horizon Union in 2022 and more recently Kyma Media. Now, with offices in London, Manchester and New York, the group&#8217;s blue chip clients include PepsiCo, Porsche, Hasbro, and Samsung. Earlier this year they secured a multimillion-pound investment from BGF, one of the UK and Ireland&#8217;s largest growth capital investors, which prompted a rebrand. The new agency has been renamed <a href="https://thenewgen.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NewGen</a> as a nod to their connection to the new generation of brands, creators, and audiences. They collaborated with London, UK-based agency <a href="https://together.agency/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Together</a> for their new identity.</p>

<figcaption>Examples of OLD identities.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>For both Kairos and Kyma, creating strong central identities for themselves has not seemed the priority. Both brands show different logos across different social media platforms. Both have little self-promotion material or social media presence. And, I get it. Having run a small independent studio, I know how difficult it can be to prioritize time for yourself over your clients. The examples above come from X and show where they are, each with a fairly modern logo, a strong primary color palette, and a reliance on geometric-based visual cues. Beyond that, neither identity has much established; so we don&#8217;t need to spend much time on the past. Other than to say, they were going after the gamer aesthetic. So as they look to expand, this was as good a time as any to rebrand.<p/>

<blockquote>
“This rebrand and repositioning is the start of the next journey for the business. NewGen was initially founded as a gaming influencer agency, however, over the last nine years, we have utilized that knowledge and experience of targeting niche audiences, and scaled this into other sectors and industries. We’re one of the only agencies in the world that can combine creators and brands under one roof.”
<br /><br />
“NewGen has expanded far beyond gaming after nine years, as we’re constantly on the forefront of what’s new and what’s possible. Our ambition is to get our clients feeling comfortable with being out of their comfort zones, generating traction, engagement and impressive results for marketing campaigns that are changing the game.” –Mike Craddock, CEO and Co-Founder of NewGen

<p>The new logo will take me a second to explain. Most importantly, it will be rarely seen in a static form like this. As you will see below, the primary logo is dynamic. But before we get into that I do want to talk about some of the form decisions that we can already see. The new name is set as a single word in all caps. It uses a mixed-type approach to separate the two syllables that help introduce those unfamiliar with the name with how to say it. &#8220;NEW&#8221; is set in a bold straight-forward san serif and &#8220;GEN&#8221; is set in a series of contrasting secondary typefaces. At first glance, it is easy to read and visually starts to hint a something in the modern tech space. The other big win is that the new name is easy to repeat (ease of memorization and ease of spelling), something that &#8220;Kairos&#8221; and &#8220;KYMA&#8221; both struggled with. All of these little decisions put it on the right track.<p/>

<blockquote>
When two social agencies merged under the name NewGen — one representing some of the world&#8217;s biggest creators, the other some of its biggest brands — they asked Together to help celebrate their union, plant their flag, and mark their territory, by conjuring up a brand to match their ethos: never standing still.
<br /><br />
As the world shifts, NewGen adapts. That, in one sentence, is the new brand&#8217;s core creative concept. Change and movement are built into its DNA: adaptive, fluid, future-proof, alive and bursting with energy. Every element is designed to express this, from all the different -graphies (typo-, icono-, photo-) to the metamorphosing logo. Nothing stands still.

<figcaption>Typography.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>As you can see above, the primary typeface is PST Elliots and the secondary typefaces are <a href="https://cotypefoundry.com/our-fonts/gridular/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gridular </a>, <a href="https://type.hanli.eu/twins/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hal Twins</a>, <a href="https://www.myfonts.com/collections/become-display-font-brenners-template" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Become Display</a>, <a href="https://www.myfonts.com/collections/ltt-recoleta-font-latinotype?rfsn=7995387.662bbe" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Recoleta</a>, <a href="https://www.fontshare.com/fonts/nippo" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Nippo</a> and <a href="https://velvetyne.fr/fonts/pilowlava/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pilowlava</a>. <p/>

<p>The use of these secondary typefaces is used to activate the logo (examples to follow). The formula here is simple. Change the &#8220;GEN&#8221; in the logo to the various secondary typefaces and then toggle between them. I really like it in this use. Keeping three letters together creates a nicely balanced logo that avoids reading the agency name as &#8220;Newgen&#8221;. Additionally, each of the typefaces pair well together in these instances to create interesting compositions. I might quibble with one or two of the secondary type choices but, as an overall set, they work well together.<p/>

<p>In headers and callouts, like in the &#8220;Think Forward&#8221; text, the formula is different. Here it appears that the prominent words each have one letter per word replaced with the secondary typefaces. This prevents the secondary typefaces to be seen in as a full word or in full formats. What I like about this approach is that it leverages the use of more expressive typefaces that would otherwise be unusable over legibility concerns. Thus, interjecting different tone of voices to key expressions. For the most part it works but I don&#8217;t like it as much as how the logo is approached. The readability can suffer. Something about single letter replacements tends to affect the reading rhythm in some instances that just throws things off a bit. Obviously, this is greatly affected by the designer&#8217;s selections. Regardless of this concern, the glitch effect does a lot of the heavy lifting to create a tech-forward feel.<p/>

<p>The supporting cast of icons, colors, and photography finish out the identity set. The icons look good without feeling overly crafted. It is an easy trap to create symbols that look too similar. The colors are fun and cheery. It feels a bit out of place for an agency, as they tend towards black (as to be not see nor heard). But I like their use here. I do find the lack of a clear primary color unusual, for now the colors seem to be evenly used. This too works, but I imagine that a color will eventually emerge as the primary. And last note about the colors is my sentiment towards naming colors generic names&#8230;because no one will know what I mean when I say &#8220;change that to energy&#8221;. I prefer the less exciting &#8220;light blue, pink, and dark green&#8221; descriptors. But I feel like I have made this point before so I will move on. We see more of the trendy high-flash photography used throughout the isolated and lifestyle images. Without a concrete product, the photography relies on people doing fun things. What is shown works well, and nicely incorporates ketchup, candy, and spark (see what I did there).<p/>

<blockquote>
NewGen needs to appeal to two very different types of partners: brands and creators.
<hr />
For NewGen’s website we took the visual elements of the brand and put them to work in a practical setting. Fundamental concepts like movement and subcultures are present in spirit throughout, as well as interesting visual applications such as glitch effects.

<p>The desktop and mobile webpages share a common layout that makes it easy to navigate and use. With high-energy photography and videos playing, simple is better. The subtle snaps and swipes definitely project a sense of youth and appeal. The website also does a really nice job of communicating what they do. Often, agencies find themselves on the edges of vagueness (&#8220;we make the world move&#8221;) trying to be more than they are instead of simple, clear and concise.<p/>

<p>I&#8217;ve only selected a few stories to display from their initial collection. From a design composition standpoint, they likely wouldn&#8217;t be considered individual showstoppers, but they do a good job of following the formula from above. They seem to hit the right note, and I am excited to see these pushed further. I see this as holding the biggest potential for really exploring how the active type can be leveraged.<p/>

<p>The advertising and swag are all fairly straightforward, which is a bit disappointing. With a digital-first orientation, it can be difficult to capture the same dynamic quality in static applications. They all feel too close to direct translations of the digital designs but, without the motion, they feel flat. I do like some parts and pieces, the <em>Angry Birds</em> billboard shows a nice depth of field. For the most part, these safely stack items in the center of the frame. I would like to see size and scale be explored to create more visual interest and capture the same dynamic quality in the digital applications.<p/>

<p class="end">Overall, the agency went from two lackluster sets of brand assets to one cohesive and complete collection. It is a major step forward. The new name, logo, and website are the stars and they more than hold everything together. I really like the glitches, they have a relevance that is both familiar and exciting. Now they just need to manage when those pops can hit the hardest, particularly in static applications. But that&#8217;s the easy part, now that the new level has already been unlocked.</p>
