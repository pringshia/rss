The word mark is based upon the font Codec Warm by Zeta fonts, with crafted letter form creating a unique identifier for the brand.<br /><br />Our photography style captures the positivity of the the sun. Imagery of our customers are captured during golden hour, taking on the warm orange hues of the Protergia sunshine gradient.<br /><br />Our brand character Gia (which is phonetically akin to ‘hi’ in Greek – γεια! ) takes shape from our sun symbol within the wordmark. Gia is here to guide Protergia customers along their energy supply journey – from chatbots within the Protergia app, to TopTips on social media platforms.

                                            <p><strong>Opinion</strong><br />
                                            The old logo was not very good, mostly due to that poor wordmark that had so much going on with a combination of super circular characters and then the super narrow “r”s, an “i” with the smallest tittle ever recorded, and that “e”. The one good thing it had going is that the “e“ aligned at the center with the gradient bar underneath and the icon above — which, to its credit, did have a proper <em>energy provider</em> abstraction to it — but, yeah, that type was not good. The new logo sticks to the all lowercase approach, which manages to work nicely with the balance of the descenders of the “p” and “g” and it also maintains the same single storey construction of the “g” and “a”. Obviously, the big shift is the integration of an icon into the wordmark with the “o” being replaced by an abstract sun icon. It's a very well executed approach that makes a lot of optical decisions to make the sun look like a glyph that belongs with the others in weight and proportion.<span></span> The identity then goes in a number of directions, all orbiting around the sun… first there is the icon that can work on its own outside of the wordmark and that interacts rather nicely with photography. Then there is the sun gradient, which is literally warm and fuzzy. Finally there is the photography that includes a sun shining in the background, echoing the orange and yellow color palette and furthering those warm and fuzzy feelings. All of these, paired with the blue/purple typography and other graphic accents, make for a happy, optimistic combination. The icon also transforms into a mascot-slash-avatar with little eyes and a cute spinning animation. Not sure if it's <em>too</em> cute and whether it takes away from any gravitas the icon might have achieved.<span></span> As noted in the caption of the launch event, give it a quick scrub… the shift in lighting from blue to orange is quite nice, making what could have been an annoying gimmick into something quite memorable with a slow burn of the shift. Also, that TV spot… with Guns N' Roses' <em>Paradise City</em> sent me. At first I was, like, “Wait, is that the song I think it is…?” and the moment the whistle blew I started headbanging. I have no idea what the payoff is, since it's literally Greek to me, but 🤘. Overall, the few applications shown are engaging and energetic and look the part of a utility company with a decent balance of approachability and corporate-ness.</p>

                                            <p>Established in 1873, <a href="https://massart.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Massachusetts College of Art and Design</a>, typically referred to as MassArt, is the only public independent college of art and design in the United States and one of its oldest art schools. What began as a school to teach drawing — spurred by The Massachusetts Drawing Act of 1870 that required most cities in the state to provide drawing instruction in public schools and mechanical drawing instruction to persons over 15 years old through evening schools — today is a comprehensive art and design institution that spans 18 undergraduate and nine graduate programs, certificates, continuing education, and post-baccalaureate study with a campus, located in Boston’s arts district, that includes nearly a million square feet of classroom, studio, exhibition, and living spaces for a student body of nearly 2,000 and a faculty of 300-plus. Recently, MassArt introduced a new identity designed by local firm, <a href="https://www.moth.design/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Moth Design</a>.</p>
<span id="more-295337"></span>

<blockquote>Every corner of MassArt vibrates with energy and excitement. To effectively illustrate the institution’s vibrancy and openness, we created a system leveraging a flexible and fun identifier: the elastic M. Unfussy and limitless in form, the elastic M, paired with fresh typography and a versatile color palette, allows for an unlimited set of configurations while remaining cohesive in voice.</blockquote><h3><a href="https://www.moth.design/projects/massart/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Moth Design project page</a></h3>

<p>The old logo, also designed by Moth Design* <a href="https://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/massterful_identity.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in the very distant past of 2008</a>, was really good in its ability to integrate yet also differentiate the two words that make up the logo by the simple gesture of cutting the “S” short and at the same angle as the “A”. It wasn&#8217;t the most exciting or “artistic” of logos but it was pretty effective and the cut angle then informed the rest of the identity.</p>

<p>The new logo aims to add some more artistic flair to the wordmark and it succeeds for the most part with the quirky “M” but unfortunately it ends up being the letter with the least prominence and body mass as the rest of the letters which feel wider and heavier. The unconventional design of the “S”s, where they feel like they are tipping forward, and their tight kerning in contrast to the “A”s to their sides, makes them stand out too much. The “R” also does this tipping-forward thing as its bowl reaches all the way to the right at the same distance as its leg (in most cases, the leg of the “R” extends to the right ever so slightly to anchor it better). It&#8217;s a decent logo and at first glance it looks good but I feel like it needed to commit more strongly to either being weirder or normal-er.</p>

<p>* Founded by a MassArt alum, Moth Design also designed <a href="https://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/new_logo_and_identity_for_maam_by_moth_design.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the college&#8217;s museum identity</a> and <a href="https://www.moth.design/projects/massart-150/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the college&#8217;s 150-year-anniversary identity</a>.</p>

<figcaption>Full name logo. Refined by MassArt faculty member <a href="https://djr.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">David Jonathan Ross</a>.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The full name logo is… a lot. The wide structure of the primary logo becomes too much when applied to 34 letters instead of just 7 and, through no fault of Moth Design or David Jonathan Ross, the line breaks created by the length of “MASSACHUSETTS” makes it a very hard set of words to work with. In this case my inclination would be to move “ART” to the second line but I am sure that, philosophically, no one wanted to separate art from design. Beyond that, though, there are still some odd design choices, like the “E”s with all the horizontal strokes being the same length instead of the middle one being the shortest and the top one shorter than the bottom one. The horizontal strokes added to the “I” hint at a desire to make this more monospace-ish but it&#8217;s not. The “TT” being the sole ligature is also distracting. It brings me no joy to nitpick this so much as it&#8217;s clearly a tough task but I feel like they painted themselves into a corner with some typographic design decisions that were not the most flexible.</p>

</figure>

<p>On the opposite end of the flexibility scale, the identity introduces what they are calling “Elastic ‘M’s”, which are kind of cool, fun, and artsy… and makes me think that, perhaps, the original design pitch involved including these “M”s into the wordmark and having them be all kinds of weird and have different ones appear in different places but that&#8217;s a hard trick to implement and not the most effective in establishing brand recognition. The “M”s are good as a supporting element and help add some interest to the layouts. I like that they don&#8217;t immediately read as “M”s and that it might be more of a subconscious delivery to viewers. I do wonder if the super thin stroke approach is the best use for these… I can see on the generator that they can be executed bolder, which makes them look a little more exciting and interesting.</p>

<p>Not a whole lot in application. The type choices are strong, particularly <a href="https://www.thedesignersfoundry.com/romek" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Romek</a>, which has some really nice proportions and it has a book-ish vibe but it&#8217;s also friendly. The identity goes for that mix of serif and sans serif in similar weights which requires a lot of fine-tuning to work and the left and center ads above <em>almost</em> pull it off. I think the issue is that the sans, <a href="https://rgtype.fontdue.com/fonts/ciron" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ciron</a>, is ever so slightly heavier. The business card provides a better example of mixing the typefaces in different sizes and then adding the two logos as bold contrasts.</p>

<p>A lot of energy seems to have gone into the website and, while I have not been the most supportive of some of the design decisions, the website does look pretty great. It feels artsy, it feels design-y, it feels academic. It&#8217;s exciting, it&#8217;s serious, and it packs a lot of information in each page through some really strong typographic hierarchy and solid layouts. Also, props for resisting the urge to do the cursor trail effect on ALL the website and instead they just limited it to the feature section in the home page — it leaves me wanting more of it instead of making me wish the website just died.</p>

<p class="end">Overall, the various nitpicks expressed in this opinion can just be personal preference of how certain things could be designed, which doesn&#8217;t mean anything here is right or wrong and, in the end, the identity does portray the college in an artistic way but also in a very professional and put together way, giving parents more confidence in their kids going to <em>art school</em>.</p>

HolaCamp is the result of the union of several family campsites, with the intention of improving the traditional model and bringing it into the future with the collaboration of an investment fund. With nine different locations, it offers various accommodations, from tents to teepees to cabins.</p>

                                            <p><strong>Relevant quote</strong><br /><em>We had the challenge of defining an outdoor accommodation brand that would integrate and expand the existing campsite offer, elevating the perception and value of the more traditional campsite by creating proprietary brand experiences that would allow the expansion and development of a new tourism model in Spain and Portugal.<br /><br />We redefined the concept of camping to connect the best of the outdoors and the best of serviced accommodation, transforming a traditional concept into a vector of growth and preference for audiences seeking these alternatives and for those who are just beginning to discover them. We developed a clear Value Proposition: to make the best of the camping we all know, something extraordinary "Camping made extraOUTdinary". A concept that elevates and qualifies us as the new generation of campsites that builds on the OUT living concept through our strengths compared to traditional hotels and campsites.<br /><br />The nostalgic hotel tradition merges with the freedom and natural beauty of camping in the visual identity. We created the distinctive Holacamp monogram, a symbol that refers to the initials of the two worlds, Hotel and Camping, complemented by a wordmark that reflects the extraoutdinary environment with a sparkle of authenticity. A visual universe that draws on a gentle and friendly typography, emphasising the back to basics. The visual system is inspired by the aesthetics of storybook covers, framing the different campstories that emerge in Holacamp, and enhancing the uniqueness of each accommodation thanks to the illustrative style and a wide and lively colour palette.

                                            <p><strong>Opinion</strong><br />
                                            I usually give my overall impression about a project at the end but this time I have to preemptively say that everything here looks good and there is a good intention behind each element but everything falls just a tad short in execution, in the specific choices made, and in coming together as a whole. Starting with the logo, there is a playfulness right away with the serif on a curve but the choice of serif and the way it's spaced out on the curve looks like the logo switched to a default font as the type ends up looking a bit uncomfortable. The icon underneath, possibly the reflection of the sun on a body of water, was also a good idea and a nice accent to place below the wordmark but its stiff, straight-line construction is at odds with with the serif. Personally, I would have made that icon echo the tapering of the serifs in the “H”.<span></span> The <a href="https://fonts.adobe.com/fonts/bookman-jf" target="_blank">Bookman</a>-esque monogram is also a nice idea but it ended up looking too restricted and, again, stiff, while also not providing enough of a visual contrast when locked up in the seal composition… something bolder would have helped offset it from the rest of the elements. The illustrations are almost like an exquisite corpse exercise where one designer was tasked with coming up with the camping structures and another one with the backgrounds and nature context without seeing what the other was doing, and they ended up with a rather confusing pair of stroke thicknesses that are similar and but different but not enough. When paired with the holding shapes, which are also arguably interesting, and the logo and the typography… it should be a good mix but it's way too many visual cues going on at the same time and the addition of the neon-esque stroke around the shapes is an odd choice.<span></span> To end on a more positive note, the serif typography is actually nice and adds a touch of glamour and elegance to camping, while the photography and color palette are warm and inviting. The posters toward the end are really good and the identity could have leaned more into that wanderlust direction and benefit from the campsite locations and wholesome vibes of not being in a crowded hotel and city center.</p>

                                            <p>Established in 1963, <a href="https://www.ladler-eisstoecke.at/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ladler</a> is a designer, manufacturer, and retailer of ice stocks for hobbyists and professionals. For the uninitiated like me, ice stock, or Eisstockschießen in German, is a winter sport popular in southern Germany and Austria that works as if curling and bocce ball had a baby, with players sliding the ice stocks across, well, ice fields. The titular objects are composed of a stick — the big round part not the actual stick — that comes in different weights; a handle; and the soles that come in different levels of friction. Founded by Erich Ladler, the company is now in its third generation of being a family-run business and handcrafts all of its products in Graz, Austria. Last year, Ladler introduced a new identity designed by local designer <a href="https://www.diemling.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lukas Diemling</a>.</p>

<blockquote>The basis of the brand is a wordmark that subtly represents the product of the Ladler brand iconographically within the “L”. Simple, immediately understandable, and giving the feeling that the logo must have existed since 1963. Clear typography, a color palette tailored to the products, and authentic images create a brand that feels like it has always been there without appearing old-fashioned.</blockquote><h3><a href="https://www.behance.net/gallery/184022749/Ladler" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lukas Diemling project page</a></h3>

<p>The previous logo was as dry as dry ice, typeset in an unexciting sans serif and rendered in gray and a muted red. Perhaps it was a reaction to another old logo in circulation that perhaps was <em>too</em> excited with its super-extra-sharp and oversized serifs, oversize swoosh, and even bigger ice stock. It was so bad it was good. The new logo is a fantastic interpretation and integration of the product into a strong wordmark, with the initial “L” evoking the handle and ice stick in a very clever way. It would have been easy or tempting (or an understandable client request) for the “L” to be more literally representative of the ice stock with a thinner handle for the vertical stroke of the “L” and a curvier top for the horizontal stroke but that would have obviously been too literal. Instead, the chosen approach for the “L” is more playful and it is perfectly suited to complement the construction of Dinamo&#8217;s <a href="https://abcdinamo.com/typefaces/ginto" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ginto Nord</a> that serves as the foundation for the wordmark.</p>

<p>The result, as you can see, is excellent. Simple and sturdy layouts, whether for the catalog or the labels applied to the soles, make great use of the typography and product photography to do all the heavy lifting. The one design-y move, perhaps, is how some of the photography is placed off center and with really wide margins but even that is just Layouts 101 in how to create tension on a page. The one negative critique would be on the backgrounds in the labels of the soles, which start to look cheap and don&#8217;t quite make sense as to what they represent, if anything.</p>
