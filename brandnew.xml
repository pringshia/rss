                                            <p>(Est. 1946) &#8220;The <a href="https://www.kviff.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Karlovy Vary International Film Festival</a> is the largest film festival in the Czech Republic and the most prestigious such festival in Central and Eastern Europe. It is one of the oldest A-list film festivals (i.e., non-specialized festivals with a competition for feature-length fiction films), a category it shares with the festivals in Cannes, Berlin, Venice, Locarno, San Sebastian, Montreal, Shanghai, and Tokyo. Among filmmakers, buyers, distributors, sales agents, and journalists, KVIFF is considered the most important event in all of Central and Eastern Europe. Every year, the festival presents some 200 films from around the world, and regularly hosts famous and important filmmakers. The Karlovy Vary festival is intended for both film professionals and the general public, and offers visitors a carefully designed programme, excellent facilities and a broad range of other services.&#8221;</p>

                                            <p><strong>Relevant quote</strong><br /><em>This year we worked again with the number of the annual festival. This time the inspiration was a simplified floor plan of the Hotel Thermal, which we used to create an abstract black and white code of one square and three circles.<br /><br />Maximum simplification was the basis for its further development. We transformed the symbol into iconic objects from the film world and the Karlovy Vary festival. Brutalist concrete, chairs from the Makhonin couple, boxes for film strips, an old camera, a projection from the cinema hall, LED screens, spotlights and film lenses. Simply a lot of different emotions on the floor plan of a fifty-eight.

                                            <p><strong>Opinion</strong><br />
                                            Few projects are as annually entertaining to cover as Studio Najbrt's ongoing collaboration with KIVFF, <a href="https://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/?s=Karlovy+Vary+International+Film+Festival+by+Studio+Najbrt" target="_blank">even if we haven't covered <em>every</em> year</a>. They always find a fun way to play with the edition number of the festival and after thinking that they couldn't abstract the number any more than they did last year’s 57, along comes 58, which has been reduced to three circles and a square. It's probably the biggest stretch yet but once you know those four shapes make a “58” — and pretty much every application says “58th” on it — it's hard not to appreciate the extreme abstraction.<span></span> Taking things one step further, the four geometric shapes can be replaced by objects that either loosely or tightly fit those silhouettes. Particularly pleasing is the concrete variation that translates <a href="https://www.thermal.cz/img/_/main/gallery-6.jpg" target="_blank">the architecture of the festival's venue</a> into Brutalist cylinders. Personally I would have been infinitely satisfied with this single iteration and perhaps further compositions of those same concrete shapes but I also appreciate the variety to represent the myriad types of films on display. The supporting typography, in <a href="https://www.myfonts.com/collections/helvetica-now-font-monotype-imaging" target="_blank">Helvetica Now</a>, is a proper match that is hard to find fault with. Overall, another excellent and playful iteration on this yearly (typo)graphic exercise and as long as they keep bringing the fire with the custom socks, we will keep posting about it.</p>

                                            <p>Established in 2005, <a href="https://www.newaim.com.au/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">New Aim</a> is one of Australia&#8217;s largest and fastest-growing private ecommerce companies, supplying more than 6,000 active SKUs across over 450 product lines including home and office furniture, electrical appliances, tools and garden, and children’s products to online marketplaces like Amazon, Catch, eBay, MyDeal, Kogan, Big W, Costco Wholesale, Barbeques Galore, David Jones, Harvey Norman, and Myer. So, for example (because I need one as much as you do), New Aim will partner with Giantz, a power tool manufacturer, <a href="https://www.harveynorman.com.au/car-travel-pet-supplies/tools/powertools/giantz/993?srsltid=AfmBOorLmuvGaN50SmfzOrtlDWk77OKzlk_MChB6itLsD8uXqrvVwt9A" target="_blank" rel="noopener">and place its products at a major retailer like Harvey Norman</a>. It manages this amount of options thanks in part to its 70,000-square-meter (750,000-square-foot) warehouse — that they compare to a very important Australian metric of four <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melbourne_Cricket_Ground" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Melbourne Cricket Grounds</a> brought together — and by its proprietary technology that improves procurement, supply chain management, multichannel integration, and price decisioning. Recently, New Aim introduced a new identity designed by Sydney, Australia-based <a href="https://christopherdoyle.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Christopher Doyle &amp; Co.</a>.</p>

<blockquote>Following a series of workshops and audits, we began with the development of a striking logomark to seamlessly integrate an A letterform with an upward-facing arrow, symbolising New Aim’s focus on productivity, performance and precision. Alongside this, a custom logotype was developed to further evoke movement, energy and joy. Its carefully considered forms and proportions ensures legibility and impact across both digital and physical platforms.</blockquote><h3><a href="https://christopherdoyle.co/projects/newaim" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Christopher Doyle &amp; Co. project page</a></h3>

<figcaption>Logo with tagline.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The old logo was a fantastic evil-corporation-in-a-movie logo with its ominous, giant warehouse and sharp-as-a-blade typography. With the company&#8217;s focus on consumer goods, it was as unfriendly as it gets, even if its business model was dealing with other businesses, not consumers directly. The new logo fixes that initial impression of a cold, faceless, soulless corporation with a much friendlier, softer first impression.</p>

<p>Playing off of the name, an upward arrow and an “A” are blended together to form a monogram that is literally… aiming. It&#8217;s a clever idea and while the monogram <em>does</em> manage to read as both an “A” and an upward arrow, both elements suffer from the integration. Meaning… the upward arrow stops being an arrow with the addition of the crossbar of the “A” which then makes it look more strongly like an “A” but then, as an “A”, it looks like its moving horizontally leaving a trail of chunky speed lines, which yield a weird slab. I dunno… maybe it&#8217;s just me reading too much into it.</p>

<p>The wordmark, in a custom unicase geometric sans serif is certainly better than the old one and is, at first glance, fun and friendly but the proportions of the letters feel off, the spacing is a little too tight, and the lack of more pronounced overshoots makes the “w” look like it&#8217;s floating and the “m” look like it&#8217;s shorter. The two lock-ups shown are also slightly off… in the header image, with the “A” stacked on top, it looks too big and in the horizontal version, it looks too small. I wish I could get more on board with this.</p>

</figure>

<p>On a more positive note, I love the dashboard graphics! The individual modules are all fun and nicely executed and they look fantastic when stacked. It starts to verge a little bit on being more music-related and DJ-ish so I kind of wish they had something more business-chart-y or data-analytic-y but I can get on <em>board</em> with this, especially with the cool monochromatic color palette. The typography — using, I believe, <a href="https://www.sharptype.co/typefaces/centra-no-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Centra No.2</a> — looks excellent in all caps and tightly set while <a href="https://www.schick-toikka.com/phonic" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Phonic and Phonic Mono</a> provide a slick contrast.</p>

<p>The applications all look great and if they feel a little familiar to <a href="https://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/new_logo_and_identity_for_dropshipzone_by_christopher_doyle_co.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dropshipzone</a>, another Christopher Doyle &amp; Co. project, it&#8217;s not a coincidence or unwarranted as Dropshipzone is an offering from New Aim so the same monochromatic and big type vibes nicely bring the two identities together. I like how in some of the applications above the monogram is built into the dashboard graphics and if I liked the monogram a bit more I would be swooning over the last advertising image.</p>

The messaging, often cold and rational, or overtly sun-loving in its expression. And with a concerted feminine lean. The end result of this monotonous approach has landed Australia in the no.1 slot for skin cancer. That’s no.1 in the entire world.<br /><br />Spotting an ozone-sized hole in the market, SICKDOGWOLFMAN saw the opportunity to not only change the tone and context of the conversation, with ‘THE SUN IS NOT YOUR FRIEND’ a striking brand positioning for a sunscreen, but to bring a degree of sensible aesthetic edge to a category devoid of real feeling and meaning.

                                            <p><strong>Opinion</strong><br />
                                            First off, props to SICKDOGWOLFMAN for creating their own consumer product and using their skills on a category that gets little attention. They could have easily launched an IPA beer. Starting with the name, the brand succeeds at changing the conversation about sunscreen and encourages consumers to slather, to drench, to bathe themselves in sunscreen as that's what's really needed. White-residue-on-your-face be damned. Slather it on. The logo is bad-ass, with its extra bold, condensed, and sharp-angled wordmark that looks like a rejected heavy metal band logo, which I mean as a compliment. Speaking of which, I would have loved to see this brand in blackletter but not all dreams can come true.<span></span> Accompanying the wordmark is an evil sun, here to wreak havoc on your skin. It's rare for any product to include a graphic representation of that which it is trying to solve, fix, or avoid so it's kind of interesting to see that flipped and make the villain the hero. On the packaging, the two elements are placed on the all-yellow squeeze bottle and supported by <a href="https://klim.co.nz/retail-fonts/national-2-condensed/" target="_blank">National 2 Condensed</a> in all caps centered. Simple, bold, and effective, thanks in large part to the no-nonsense copywriting where Sun = Bad and Fuck the Sun. (I mean, yes, we need the sun in many ways, so I say that respectfully.) Things can get a little weird as with <a href="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0711/6023/4242/files/Slather_Up.png" target="_blank">their illustration on the footer of the website</a> but not as weird as <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DDOUN5RP4Z8/" target="_blank">this</a>. Overall, this is a great antidote for the overly friendly direct-to-consumer brands that have come online in the past few years and this is perfectly designed and positioned for all the bros out there who think sunscreen is for the weak.</p>

Currently in a beta testing phase and set to launch in 2025, <a href="https://www.alma.food/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alma</a> is a food tracking companion app trying to bring soul and celebration to the typically tedious efforts of calorie counting and meal planning, with a stated mission to “make healthy eating effortless through AI-powered nutrition tracking and personalized food discovery.” In an effort to stand out in a crowded competitive landscape, Alma has introduced a new brand identity designed by Philadelphia, PA-based <a href="https://smith-diction.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Smith &amp; Diction</a>.

<blockquote>
Alma is building a nutrition companion that meets you where you are and tracks actual imperfect human activity, not the gym rat robot that these other apps seem to assume their users are. You contain multitudes, and cheese.
<br><br/>
The more we thought about it, the more we felt like this is the perfect space to inject some soul and liveliness. This is where it will be noticed most. It’s much easier to stand out in a sea of bland with a really good brand.

We use brand pillars as conceptual guidelines and inspiration anytime we’re building a brand—but for this one, we took things a bit further and injected the pillars right into the brand symbol.
<br><br/>
Each logo element represents a pillar. The open journal represents personal insights. The bowl shows how you can discover new flavors with Alma’s recipe suggestion feature. And the circle at the top represents a person, or the tracking macros that are a major part of the product design.

The logo as a whole — a wordmark set in Grilli Type’s
<a href="https://www.grillitype.com/typeface/gt-alpina" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GT Alpina</a>
Condensed Bold accompanied by a simple, geometric icon — isn’t anything groundbreaking, but I’d argue that actually works in its favor, giving it a timeless, maybe-this-brand-has-been-around-for-a-while kind of flavor. The icon feels kind of basic at first glance, but it’s actually pretty brilliant in that it accomplishes the rare feat of giving you a generally coherent idea of what the app is about just by looking at it (bowl + book definitely = recipe, in my mind), while expertly balancing simplicity with ownability (almost impossible these days), and all that with the added benefit of mimicking an “A” to the point that you could aaaaalmost call it a monogram. (I would be remiss not to point out that the overall feel here— chunky serif, retro styling, green color palette — is definitely giving
<a href="https://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/new_logo_identity_and_packaging_for_chobani_done_in_house.php " target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chobani</a>, but given that that particular rebrand is coming up on 8 years old and honestly still slaps, I’d say the resemblance is a mark in Alma’s favor.)

Rami and Adam landed on the name Alma, which is Spanish for soul. Rami was telling us about a trip to Spain and how he got swept up in the art, the culture, and the food. He was like, I know this is going to sound crazy but when I close my eyes and think of the Alma brand, it’s very painterly, exciting, and vibrant. Food is art, so why not inject that into the brand?

The Alma team is planning to include a visual anytime someone adds a meal they’ve eaten into the app. That’s literally thousands of images. Probably millions. The Alma team wanted the app to feel flavorful and fresh, so they didn’t want to buy a standard pack of photos from iStock or wherever.
<br /><br/>
Weird but relevant aside, we were introduced to the Alma folks via Colin Dunn from <a href="https://visualelectric.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Visual Electric</a>. So as we were thinking about this artistic food angle we were like, hmmmm what if we fire up an AI generator and see what it spits out? If we could wrangle this thing to make food images properly, we could solve the thousands of images problem beautifully.
<br /><br />
What came out of this exercise was pure magic. And also some dog shit. But mostly magic.

We showed this to the Alma folks and they were fully, massively on board. They were SO on board that decided to add Visual Electric-esque collage generation right into Alma. Soon, you’ll be able to enter any kind of recipe into the app, and it will generate a custom collage out of the ingredients. Which is a great feature for a food tracking app that also suggests customized recipes based on your tummy troubles.

<p>
The brand boasts a distinct visual language, balancing a robust color palette with a fairly paired down approach to typography (more GT Alpina, along with HAL Typeface’s
<a href="https://type.hanli.eu/four-grotesk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Four Grotesk</a>
). I’ve seen a lot of scenarios in which the wordmark matching the brand typeface goes awry — either visuals start to get redundant, or the logo and messaging compete with each other, or both— but luckily, this is not one of those scenarios. Since the messaging only appears in lighter weights of Alpina if the wordmark is used as part of the composition, visual hierarchy is maintained, and the graphic design gods are appeased.
</p>
<p>
The recipe-as-collage approach works on a conceptual level as well as an aesthetic one, with the retro styling fortifying the accessible and timeless feel of the identity. That said, the obvious flash point here is going to be the use of AI (in this case, image generator
<a href="https://visualelectric.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Visual Electric</a>) to create art that could, feasibly, have been created from scratch by a real human artist with feelings and— more importantly, in this late-stage-capitalist hellscape we live in— bills to pay. There are plenty of arguments for and against various versions of this approach, which I suspect will be hotly debated by you, dear readers, in the comments section. But because I feel neither qualified nor well-informed enough to make a moral judgement call here, I will instead share a relevant personal anecdote: having recently made a lot of this collage style imagery (the semi-old fashioned way, aka Photoshop) for a 
<a href="https://www.changeclimate.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">small nonprofit client</a>, but not having the bandwidth to continue making it all myself, I’ve been attempting to create some guidelines for their team (which lacks an in-house designer) to make their own in Canva. It is a huge pain in the ass for everyone involved, and had I realized before today that I could have outsourced that work to robots that would provide a higher quality result at a budget my client could afford, I absolutely would have.
</p>
<p>
Anyway, if you want a reminder that we’re still a few years away from the singularity, I highly recommend heading over to Medium to read <a href="https://medium.com/smith-diction/branding-alma-25f352285455" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Smith &#038; Diction case study</a> for a look at AI collage rejects from this project, which range <a href="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:2000/format:webp/1*MTSg-t93ByZXbTFKvRXZMw.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener">from the vaguely bizarre to the borderline horrifying</a>.

<blockquote>
All the designs we make in the brand concept phase are just that, concepts. For Alma, we took a stab at a few different ways to treat the product so they could pick which they liked best and run with it on their own.
<br><br/>
This has been a great way to test brand typefaces and colors across an entire brand. A bold color or a quirky condensed typeface that looks dope in marketing materials might not even come close to working across product, where you don’t want brand to overpower usability.</blockquote>

<p>
The applications do a nice job fleshing out the identity, with the OOH applications continuing to exhibit thoughtful typographical hierarchy and compositional balance with a side of surprise and delight. The handful of digital concepts give us an idea of how the brand will be put to the test functionally, and while they look nice, they admittedly start to feel like a bit of a departure from everything we’ve seen up to this point— I wonder if there’s a more inspired, cohesive way other than gradients to bring the vibrancy of the rest of the brand into the digital experience without compromising on functionality. Will leave that one to the product designers.

<p class="end">
Overall, this identity does a great job of bringing an unexpected vibrancy to what can be a tedious and at times downright unpleasant process. It will be interesting to see how the brand translates to the digital experience once the app is launched to the public, and if they manage to balance the inherently complex functionality required of a food tracking app with the joy and soulfulness promised by the brand. It will be <em>really</em> interesting to see how they manage to integrate image generating tools directly into the UX, given what kind of imagery users might end up with without the interference of a human curator.
