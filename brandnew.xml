A floating photography style, where cookware appears to levitate, reinforces the alchemy of great cooking—where ingredients, technique, and tools come together seamlessly. This distinctive aesthetic extends across all touchpoints, from packaging and promotions to digital and in-store displays, ensuring a cohesive and premium presence.<br /><br />The rebrand scales effortlessly across Wolstead’s expanding range while maintaining a consistent, premium look. The impact has been immediate, with sales increasing over 50% year-on-year, solidifying Wolstead as a leader in performance cookware.

                                            <p><strong>Opinion</strong><br />
                                            I almost fell out of my chair when I saw the old logo because I can't think of anyone in recent times using the font Chicago in a non-ironic way as it's dated, clunky, and very out of fashion. So out of fashion that it never even made it unto <a href="https://www.trendlist.org/" target="_blank">the wave of ugly design in the 2010s</a>. (We did embrace it <a href="https://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/new_logo_and_identity_for_2014_brand_new_conference_by_underconsideration.php" target="_blank">for our 2014 Brand New Conference</a> that took place in, yup, Chicago.) Anyway, the old logo actually looked good in Chicago. I don't know if it was the right combination of letters or the spacing or just the fact that the “W” in the font is kind of killer but it worked. I would have loved to see a modern interpretation of it but the new wordmark is nice too and much more appropriate for a modern-day cookware brand. There is not much to rhapsodize about other than the quirky middle stroke of the “E” which I imagine is meant to look like the handle of a pan? It's an interesting quirk but ultimately a bit distracting.<span></span> The highlight of the project is the product photography, with the pots, pans, and air fryers floating in space against some richly-colored backdrops. There is something very attractive and engaging about the lack of gravity for what are typically heavy objects and the contrast of the product materials with the matte backdrops really makes each object pop. On the packaging, the photography stands out even more by being surrounded with a thick white frame that bleeds into a big white space area where the logo sits vertically. Each element on the box manages to both stand out and bring attention to the others. The floating concept is extended to social media content as different ingredients appear to be in a zero-gravity chamber… which is kind of charming but also kind of cheesy, like a bad AI effect. Passing almost unperceived is a fun “W” monogram that sits on top of what looks like a pan, ready to sizzle. Overall, this is a solid upgrade and update that helps amplify the high quality of the products.</p>

<blockquote>After committing to the vision of ‘Economic Growth. For Good.’ we built Extantia’s identity around the transition to cleaner, more sustainable, and resilient technology — Inspired by the optimism of the 1960s, when the world embraced innovation with enthusiasm, the design revives the belief that industries can be part of the solution. Abstract collages symbolize this vision, illustrating the coexistence and mutual elevation of technology, humanity, and the planet. The bold logo, also a nod to the ’60s, reflects planetary balance, while Kimera’s custom adaptation of Melange echoes its form, bringing a futuristic edge to classic layouts.</blockquote><h3>Studio zur Strassen provided text</h3>

<p>To its credit, the old logo was visually ambitious and didn&#8217;t settle for a simple off-the-shelf solution but, personally, I pretty much dislike everything about it. In recent years I had been pleasantly surprised by how much I was enjoying new unicase wordmarks but that old one serves as a reminder of why they annoy me so much, with the huge “a”s and tiny “T”s in this case. The blue halo thing in the background was kind of a cool graphic and climate-y but oddly placed, oddly sized, and somewhat ambiguous. The new logo goes for a more minimalist and mature approach, introducing an icon-slash-monogram that is both an abstraction of a globe and a lowercase “e”. I keep wondering if it should more clearly be an “e” with a small gap on the lower right side but I kind of like that it&#8217;s not as literal. The minimalism is envious, though, and the kind of mark one sketches but disregards because you think the client won&#8217;t go for it. The wordmark, using <a href="https://kimeracorp.eu/typefaces/melange-grotesk" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Melange Grotesk</a>, is fine for the most part but the slightly wide structure of it yields some distractingly-wide “a”s and is perhaps a little too deadpan for my taste but the notch in the “E” helps create a nice symbiosis between the two elements.</p>

<p>The identity brings together a slew of cool elements, most notably the collages that mix and match moody imagery of nature and industry coupled with some torn-paper-like graphics and, the icing on the cake, the sprinkling of some ambiguous technical drawings. There is something just so inherently pleasing about the compositions, which, in part, may come from the fast-paced motion behaviors and how all of the elements snap and slide together. The color palette also helps sell the serious tone of the collages that offer a subtle sense of doom mixed with some optimism and that the time to act and support climate innovations is now. Maybe that&#8217;s too philosophical of a read into these but, in essence, they are pretty great compositions. The technical drawings on their own are cool and I love how they show up throughout the identity and on Extantia&#8217;s website. The matching icon set is fairly impressive too, taking the thin-like aesthetic of the diagrams and effectively translating complex ideas like “land agriculture” or “green molecules” through that visual language.</p>

<p>The applications are really good, making excellent use of the collages in both animated and static form by integrating them seamlessly into any number of layout formats with the typography, which as deadpan as it is, it looks undeniably good and supports the science-y vibe this is going for. I&#8217;m still not exactly sure what the notches in the icon/monogram and typography mean but they also work well in application, giving a sense that something is missing and that that something could potentially be found with the help of Extantia. I also applaud the restraint of limiting the notches to only one letter per sentence and not overdoing it by giving every capital letter a notch, which would have been too distracting from the messaging.</p>

                                            <p><strong>Opinion</strong><br />
                                            Although I billed this as “New <em>Logo</em> and Identity for…”, the logo update is the least interesting aspect of the project and, in the grand scheme of things, not the element that makes or breaks the identity BUT it did change and it's my duty to observe that change. As a sub-brand of Wise, the old logo was functional but it definitely looked like it was put together in a rush and with not a whole lot of consideration for how the word “Platform” would read at that smaller size, in that bolder weight, and with that tighter typesetting. In short: not great. The new logo gives “Platform” much more prominence by making it the same height as the main logo but offers a nice contrast in its lighter weight and more pleasant spacing. The new logo takes up more real estate being so wide but the strength of the main logo and the clarity of the new type can withstand going real small. Long way of saying this is a good sub-brand update.<span></span> While we often talk a lot about sub-brand logos we don't often talk about sub-identities so this is a great example of this particular challenge that builds off from Ragged Edge's identity for Wise <a href="https://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/new_logo_and_identity_for_wise_by_ragged_edge.php" target="_blank">two years ago</a>. Some of the elements might be familiar, particularly the custom typeface and the textural 3D illustrations, making it seem like it's just the same identity but there are a few key differences. The main one is the introduction of a translucent layer that ties to the Wise Platform functioning as a seamless layer between the back- and front-end of financial transactions — not only is it conceptually sound but it is visually delightful, adding a grainy, blurry, darkened texture to whatever it lands upon.<span></span> The color palette also shifts to the darker green within the brand's existing color palette, giving it a more serious look that is better suited for B2B and enterprise interactions. The funky patterns remain in play but here are also limited to green hues — whereas the main identity uses a variety of color ranges — and the 3D illustrations remain quirky and engaging. Overall, this is a great adaptation of the primary Wise identity that retains all of its established traits but smartly modified to better communicate the Wise Platform offering to a very specific and demanding sector.</p>

Located in Chelsea, the gallery was founded as an initiative of <a href="https://www.garde-intl.com/top.php?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GARDE,</a> a Japan-based creative firm specializing in design, branding, and cultural projects. In collaboration with Brooklyn-based agency <a href="https://athleticsnyc.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Athletics,</a> GOCA’s brand identity and digital experience were designed to establish the gallery as a cultural bridge — one that connects American, Japanese, and Greater Asian perspectives through contemporary art.</p>

For GOCA, a Gallery of Contemporary Art with a strong focus on emerging Asian artists, art is a medium of cultural exchange. It connects varied sensibilities and inspires us to see the world, and ourselves, in new ways. To bring together American, Japanese, and Greater Asian perspectives, GOCA has artists take center stage. Its brand and site experience offers audiences an introduction to these new voices, while affording the gallery a vibrant hub — to showcase new art, encourage dialogue, and host new ideas.
<br /><br />
For GOCA’s wordmark, we drew inspiration from katakana — syllabic characters — borrowing curves and corners for a bold and warm tone. The central ‘o,’ we’ll see, can be leveraged as a dynamic asset — something of a spotlight.

<figcaption>Logo as pattern.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>GOCA’s name follows a familiar institutional naming convention — acronymized in the vein of <a href="https://www.moma.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MoMA,</a> <a href="https://www.moca.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MOCA,</a> and <a href="https://noma.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NOMA</a> — immediately placing it within the world of contemporary art institutions. It’s catchy, compact, and conveniently four letters, a dream setup for any designer tasked with crafting a logotype. Phonetically, it also carries the impression of being a Japanese word, reinforcing the gallery’s connection to Japanese and Greater Asian artists.</p>

<p>The logotype itself balances quirkiness and structure, with each letterform exhibiting its own expressive personality while adhering to an overall geometric system. The stylization of the “g” has me drooling, unmistakably referencing Japanese katakana, while the filled-in “o” adds depth and primes the glyph to function as the “spotlight” Athletics highlights in their case study — unfortunately, this concept never quite pays off effectively in application (a fact we will absolutely get to shortly). Initially, the “a” felt like an outlier, but upon further consideration, its distinctiveness enhances the individuality of the letterforms, reflecting the individuality of the artists showcased at the gallery.</p>

<p>However, what initially appeared to be a bespoke typographic execution is, in fact, simply “goca” typeset in <a href="https://vj-type.com/9-kobe" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kobe Bold</a> by <a href="https://vj-type.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">VJ Type</a> (a typeface also used throughout the identity for subheads), with specific OpenType stylistic sets applied to the “g” and “a” respectively. To its credit, Kobe was designed with Japanese calligraphic influences baked in, making it an unusually well-suited typeface for this identity. If a default font had to be used, this was probably the best possible choice. That said, as a type nerd who obsesses over letterforms and often spends an unreasonable amount of time fiddling over mostly imperceptible details while crafting or customizing logotypes whenever possible, there’s always a twinge of deflation in realizing that what looked like a carefully sculpted custom logotype is, in reality, just a well-selected font. It’s like being floored by a crazy magic trick, only to peek behind the curtain and find out the magician just bought a really good prop.</p>

</div>
<figcaption>Animated patterns.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>GOCA’s pattern system builds on the filled-in “o” of the logotype, using black circles that animate by compressing into horizontal lines before expanding back into circles. This approach takes two main forms: first, the logotype itself is rendered in this pattern and animated as a continuous horizontal scroll, a technique used in digital applications like the website’s homepage hero and the storefront’s digital sign. The scrolling effect adds movement and energy, and while it’s sleek, it feels more like a stylistic choice than a deeply conceptual one. I suppose it loosely reinforces the idea of a gallery with rotating artists, but it doesn’t necessarily communicate anything about contemporary Asian art, cultural exchange, or the gallery’s mission.</p>

<p>The second application consists of amorphous, abstract compositions, which appear across print, digital, and OOH contexts — sometimes as standalone graphic elements, sometimes as borders, sometimes as framing devices. In motion, the undulating compression and expansion of the circles is mesmerizing, lending a contemporary, high-design sensibility to the identity. But in static form, the patterns take on a blobby, dot-matrix aesthetic that feels somewhat arbitrary. While there’s a clear visual connection to the logomark, I wonder how many non-designers will look at these patterns (without the benefit of all this explanatory material) and think, &#8220;Oh cool. I see what they did. The pattern is made out of the “o” in the logotype — the visual metaphor for the ‘artist spotlight’ — and the fact that there are a lot of “o”s represents the breadth of art, artists, and cultures all coming together within this gallery!&#8221;</p>

<p>In reality, the meaning behind these patterns is murky. Do they reference something specific? Are they meant to evoke cultural elements from Japanese or Greater Asian art that I’m just not picking up on? The closest conceptual parallel — and this is really me reaching here — is that they vaguely resemble abacus beads. And yeah, ancient Japan was one of several civilizations that used abacuses, but if <em>that’s</em> the intended reference, it’s tenuous at best. Ultimately, while the patterns look neat and feel contemporary, they read more as decorative flourishes than essential storytelling devices.</p>

<p>The typographic system follows a familiar formula for contemporary and modern art institutions — juxtaposing a geometric identity with a more humanist serif. For headlines, GOCA uses good ol’ <a href="https://www.grillitype.com/typeface/gt-alpina" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GT Alpina Italic</a> by <a href="https://www.grillitype.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Grilli Type,</a> the go-to typeface for modern museums and galleries looking to add warmth and contrast to a stark visual identity. It’s an excellent choice, but one that’s become somewhat predictable in this space. Subheads are set in Kobe, reinforcing the logotype’s quirky, stylized geometry. While most people won’t catch the subtle nod to Japanese calligraphy baked into the Kobe’s DNA, it’s a clever Easter egg for type nerds who do. Body copy is <a href="https://extraset.ch/typefaces/klarheit-grotesk/klarheit-kurrent/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ES Klarheit Kurrent</a> by <a href="https://extraset.ch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Extraset,</a> a geometric sans with sharp, unexpected cuts that echo the eccentricities of Kobe while maintaining readability. It’s an unconventional yet well-balanced selection that adds texture to the overall system.</p>

<p>The color palette leans heavily on black and white, a restrained and expected approach for this type of identity. The rationale is twofold: first, black and white instantly make geometric branding feel sleek and contemporary; second, the minimalism ensures that nothing competes with the art itself — whether in-gallery or across printed and digital materials. Beyond the core palette, there are occasional pops of red, tennis-ball yellow-green, desaturated moss green, cream, and burgundy, but it’s unclear whether these are intentional brand colors or simply chosen ad-hoc per application.</p>

<blockquote>
GOCA’s unifying concept is one of balance. It channels the gallery’s warm nature as a space for living artists, while respecting the tones and conventions that attend the New York art world, and Chelsea specifically. At its center is a voice — the presence of the individual artist — a human and approachable foundation for our identity. The Gallery’s name, an acronym, is inspired by institutional abbreviations, and invokes speed and dynamism with its first syllable, go.

<p>While I wish the pattern had a stronger conceptual foundation, I can’t deny that it makes for a pretty cool window graphic — especially as a framing device for the digital sign inside, which cleverly features the animated logotype scroll. The logo itself looks crisp as a vinyl decal on the front door, reinforcing the gallery’s minimalist aesthetic. Beyond the storefront, the signage is just as strong, with the individually-cut metal letterforms adhered to the wall looking absolutely badass.</p>

Nestled below the Highline and in the heart of Chelsea, GOCA’s gallery space is a hub designed to showcase art and innovative brands from the Asian diaspora. A long hall with striking skylights, the space is a kind of bridge between continents, and hosts a variety of programming. In addition to information graphics, environmental branding ornaments, glass installations at several key points.

<p>Athletics didn’t have a hand in GOCA’s interiors, but the space itself is exactly what you’d expect from a contemporary art gallery — minimalistic, architecturally interesting, and awash in white, providing a neutral backdrop that lets the artwork take center stage. The long, skylit hall and glass installations add a sense of openness and fluidity, subtly reinforcing the gallery’s positioning as a bridge between cultures. It’s clean, sharp, and purposefully restrained, ensuring that the space serves the art rather than competing with it.</p>

<blockquote>
Built on the foundational shapes of the wordmark, the identity system flexes and bends to activate at a variety of scales. It’s as elegant as it is invitational, often framing artists in portraiture or, surprisingly, opening a window onto their artistic process itself. Video and motion breathe dynamism into its structure, which modulates easily to accommodate various depths of content — from out-of-home ads to deep-dives in a catalog.

</figure>

<p>At its core, GOCA’s print applications amount to logo, pattern, and type on stuff — mostly well-designed, but lacking a unifying concept that ties everything together. The “o” as a spotlight device, which Athletics positioned as a key element in their case study, only comes through in two places: the subway OOH ad, where a red-duotoned artist portrait fills the “o” in the logotype (a predictable but effective execution), and the business card, where the “o” is die-cut. And honestly, that business card highlights exactly where this idea should have gone further. A die-cut “o” acting as a window could have been an elegant, functional motif across multiple touchpoints — imagine an art catalog using it to reveal glimpses of artwork, or a name tag with a cutout “o” framing the wearer’s photo. It’s not the most groundbreaking execution, but in this context, it would have been a solid, clear realization of the “spotlight” concept. Athletics could have pushed this much further (or maybe they tried but GOCA weren&#8217;t feeling it — who knows?), and it’s a shame that such a natural opportunity was left largely untapped.</p>

<blockquote>
A digital space for GOCA, the web experience carries its focus on art and artists to a new surface. It features vibrant animation — the centerpiece of a hub that feels alive and breathing. Shapes drawn from the logomark activate in refined motion, forming patternwork that shifts over time. Showcases of current exhibits, artist’s stories, and featured pieces tell the gallery’s story with economy, and vivid detail.

<p>The website is sleek, and the animated pattern elements add a welcome layer of dynamism. However, my gripes with the lack of cohesive conceptual underpinnings extend into the digital experience as well. The “spotlight” concept that Athletics framed as a defining aspect of the identity feels largely absent here. The motion work gives the site a sense of energy, but there’s no clear connection back to the core idea, making the experience feel more like an aesthetic — rather than thematic — execution.</p>

<p class="end">The social posts introduce yet another expression of the “spotlight” concept, this time using static artist portraits and artwork video content inside 3&#215;3 and 4&#215;4 overlapping circle frames. If this is meant to be the ultimate realization of the idea, it simply doesn’t translate. A single circular frame would have been much more direct, but instead, these compositions feel random and disconnected from the rest of the identity. Across every touchpoint, the original concept feels muddled — stretched too thin, applied inconsistently, or lost altogether. The result is a visual identity that looks the part but never fully delivers on its creative premise. In the end, the spotlight wasn’t just underutilized — it was lost in translation.</p>
