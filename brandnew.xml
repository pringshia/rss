Debuting in last week&#8217;s women&#8217;s Big 12 tournament, the court features black baselines and sidelines; the Big 12 logo splashed across center court; and a dizzying step-and-repeat, tone-on-tone “XII” pattern that goes from edge to edge. It looks like the world&#8217;s biggest watermark.

                                            <p><strong>Relevant quote</strong><br /><em>We conducted comprehensive research with audiences across eight global markets, revealing a core truth: the brand needed to stand for what a leader can solve that others can’t — effective and permanent impact. The big brand idea, tackling the root causes of animal cruelty, does just that, evoking the idea of what the Humane Society actually does: More than treat the symptoms of the problem, it brings the global resources, expertise and clout needed to create enduring change.<br /><br />[The] brand needed a more intuitive name that told a resonant story, preserving existing equity while gaining new ground​. Humane World for Animals links to the legacy name while clearly communicating a global, animal mandate.<br /><br />In developing the new symbol, we designed a more active mark that celebrates the brand’s impact across the sky, land and sea. The new globe icon, with interlocking animals in motion, speaks to the dynamic animal ecosystem and our interconnected relationships across the animal kingdom. The streamlined logo helps the brand be more visible, flexible, and better connect emotionally with audiences—especially as the focal point of the brand’s launch hero spot (developed by creative agency Nexus).<br /><br />The iconic globe is supported by an eye-catching new design system that features a visual and verbal voice that helps the brand break through in a crowded media landscape. Communications feature powerful animal photography paired with a bold typographic language, Sharp Grotesk, to make a compelling emotional statement of action. A color palette and system of organic shapes inspired by animals and their natural environments round out the design toolkit.

                                            <p><strong>Opinion</strong><br />
                                            Another blast from the Brand New past as the old logo <a href="https://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/the_united_states_of_animalia.php" target="_blank">was first featured in the oh-so-distant past of 2007</a> and that remains one of my favorite logos of the early Brand New days. If it were released today as is — with better typography, though, please and thank you — I would praise it as much as I did 18 years ago. Despite its amount of elements and crazy quantity of vectors, it was such a simple and effective logo, forming the U.S. map with strategically positioned animals.<span></span> As good as it was, it had become limiting given the global scope of the previously named The Humane Society of the United States and Humane Society International so the new name and logo correct that fairly elegantly. The name doesn't waste any time and gets straight to the point: What do we want? A humane world for animals. Nothing short of that will do. It's simple, it's effective, and it's a call to action (and a reminder that, in fact, we do not live in a world that is entirely humane for animals) with every impression. The new visual representation is a similar shift, abandoning the specificity of the U.S. map for a circular composition that universally stands for global and world-y. The drawings of the five animals are all quite well executed — the dog's legs are a <em>little</em> questionable — and effortlessly and organically form a circle, meaning that none of the animals feel forced into a position that isn't natural to them just to pull off the trick. The wordmark is fine and does the best job possible with such a long name.<span></span> The identity turns to one of the condensed widths of <a href="https://www.sharptype.co/typefaces/sharp-grotesk" target="_blank">Sharp Grotesk</a> for a friendly yet serious typographic voice that ends up carrying a sense of urgency due to the messaging that, no two ways around it, is a harsh reminder that people can be cruel to animals and that it needs to stop. For the launch of the new name, things went in a few different odd directions. Not bad-odd just unexpected-odd. The stop-motion spot is actually excellent and goosebump-inducing as adorable animals go from captivity and cruelty to freedom and frolicking, all to the tune of Peter Gabriel’s “Solsbury Hill” as sung by Sia, who performed the song on <em>Jimmy Kimmel Live</em> wearing a custom dress and headpiece made entirely of a pattern that builds on the icon. So, yeah, good-odd. Overall, a very thoughtful and complete rebranding effort that balances the negative realities still happening around the world with a sense of optimism and hope.</p>

Based in Lisle, IL, it was acquired by <a href="https://traton.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TRATON Group</a> — a subsidiary of the Volkswagen Group and one of the world&#8217;s largest commercial vehicle manufacturers, with its Scania, MAN, International, Volkswagen Truck &amp; Bus, IC Bus and Neoplan brands — in 2021 and last year Navistar was renamed, simply, as <a href="https://www.international.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">International</a>. Now, to some, International might ring a bell, in part because of <a href="https://1000logos.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/International-Trucks-Logo.png target="_blank">its well-known logo</a> and in part because their trucks have been around American roads for decades — 12 to be exact, as International was born in 1902. <a href="https://news.international.com/WeAreInternational" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Along with the new name</a> and its transition from being a truck manufacturer to a provider of end-to-end mobility solutions, International introduced a new identity designed by <a href="https://www.kurppahosk.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kurppa Hosk</a>.</p>

<blockquote>Navistar was born in 1986 as a holding company for several brands in the commercial vehicle space. But nearly 40 years later, the name still had little internal and external engagement and was far less well-known than International Trucks, a brand with significant equity and heritage within the North American commercial transport industry.<br /><br />Amplifying “International”, a name with roots stretching back to 1902, was key to connecting with the company’s champions and uniting a portfolio of scattered product brands into a cohesive customer-centric experience ready for the future.<br /><br />International would now be the signature asset through which the majority of the company’s offerings would be experienced. Paired with a completely new visual identity that draws deeply on its rich history as an icon of the American road, we created something truly timeless for International: a brand grounded in heritage and history with all the energy and forward momentum of its most futuristic peers.</blockquote><h3><a href="https://www.kurppahosk.com/work/international" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kurppa Hosk project page</a></h3>

</figure>

<p>The old name and logo were as corporate and generic as it gets, with the company sounding more like an onboard navigation system platform and looking more like a moving company than a purveyor of bad-ass trucks. The International name in the U.S. is well associated with the trucking industry even if you are not in said industry… it&#8217;s just one of those all-American names, so it makes a lot of sense for the parent company to adopt it even at the expense of retiring some of its other brand names in favor of the single one. (That is, if I understand things correctly in that all International products and services are now NOT named anything other than International, as their website, breaks down <a href="https://www.international.com/products" target="_blank" rel="noopener">their portfolio</a> not by brand but by category.)</p>

<blockquote>Our foundational brand work pinpointed the unique, proven way that International helps its customers move their businesses forward — and the ways it would need to better meet its customers in the future. From a bespoke typeface and a refined color palette drawn from the language of the road to both digital and physical touchpoints, each facet is chosen to be complementary to the whole. It all adds up to an experience that is uniquely and unmistakably International.</blockquote><h3><a href="https://www.kurppahosk.com/work/international" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kurppa Hosk project page</a></h3>

<figcaption>Icon detail.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Apart from adopting the name from the “consumer” brand, the parent company has also adopted and reinterpreted the iconic badge through a minimalist rendition of it that removes all elements except for the recognizable diamond shape and road leading into the horizon. (As mentioned in the caption but to reiterate, I am not 100% sure if the old truck badge is going away but I get the sense that it is.) It&#8217;s a slick-looking mark and it&#8217;s kind of interesting that, in its white on dark renditions, it almost comes across as a luxury car brand — now that all car brands have adopted minimalist icons that light up in the front of the grill. The new wordmark is typeset in the identity&#8217;s custom typeface (shown further below) and it helps balance the upscale look of the new icon with an industrial aesthetic. The wordmark helps convey that their products are made to last and take a beating on the road. Those “A”s really make the thing work.</p>

<blockquote>The Language of the Road is the unifying force of the visual identity, tying together all of the visual elements, drawing inspiration from the colors, shapes, symbols and patterns along the iconic roads of North America. Strand by strand, the visual DNA seemingly writes itself: A road becomes a symbol. A landscape, a palette. Roadside signage inspires a typeface. The motion and dynamics of a vehicle shape the primitives of our animations and interactions.</blockquote><h3><a href="https://www.kurppahosk.com/work/international" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kurppa Hosk project page</a></h3>

<figcaption>Custom typeface.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>One of the highlights of the identity is the custom type family and Kurppa Hosk <a href="https://www.kurppahosk.com/work/international/typography" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has a dedicated page for it</a> with far more specimens and samples. As already hinted at in my opinion about the wordmark, I think this is a great typeface, looking like it was forged in an industrial complex. There is also a subtle elegance and restraint to it that helps it avoid becoming too cartoony or too much of a display typeface, although some characters feel slightly out of place… like the “G”, “R”, or even the “S” that are more “normal” and missing some of those subtle angular shifts in the “A” and “N”. Still, a pretty great typeface.</p>

<blockquote>In this pursuit of authenticity, photography and film are key, especially the subjects of their focus. International has always been about more than the vehicles; it&#8217;s about the people behind them. To show that dichotomy, we struck a careful balance, creating an aesthetic that seemed to blur the focus between man and machine.</blockquote><h3><a href="https://www.kurppahosk.com/work/international" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kurppa Hosk project page</a></h3>

<p>The other highlight is the photography and film… I love the comfort of my sofa at home and my minivan on the quiet streets of Bloomington, IN, but damn if these photos don&#8217;t make me want to truck around the U.S. in my trucker hat (that I don&#8217;t have). Okay, maybe that&#8217;s a stretch but, seriously, this is some great photography that conveys pride in the work behind these trucks in order to get drivers safely across hundreds of miles.</p>

<blockquote>The new strategic shift and return of International to masterbrand created both a tremendous opportunity and responsibility — the chance to revitalize and breathe new life into this American icon.<br /><br />While paying homage to the historic brand, we also needed to develop an identity fit for today and tomorrow, a brand optimized for the environments and surfaces an industry-wide transformation requires.</blockquote><h3><a href="https://www.kurppahosk.com/work/international" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kurppa Hosk project page</a></h3>

<p>Not a whole lot in actual application but it&#8217;s easy to see how well the strong identity elements can be deployed by simply letting the type, photography, and the actual product do all the heavy lifting. One nice detail about the advertising and other visual language samples is the headline treatment, where the typography just sits on a single wide line in the middle of the layout, looking like a long straight road from above.</p>

                                            <p><strong>Relevant quote</strong><br /><em>Toca Boca needed to level up their identity to keep up with their growing audience. Our brief was to create a master brand that could bend, stretch, and flex, to frame their ever-growing universe of new games and experiences.<br /><br />Diving deep into scientific research (zzzzzzz) about play, we were inspired by the innately human need to explore and test boundaries. To set rules, break rules, and change rules. And this insight led us to the design concept, Boundless Play, which allows the brand to grow older without ever growing up.<br /><br />The new identity ‘sets rules’ for consistency and ‘breaks rules’ for creative expression. We set rules with a re-crafted logotype, multicolored palette, bold typeface, and an accessible and absurd tone of voice. While graphic gestures, inspired by game interactions and boundless play, break the rules and wiggle their way into various spaces. They are supported by smiling emojis, in-game items, and characters, as well as the signature motion bounce that defies gravity.

                                            <p><strong>Opinion</strong><br />
                                            I had not thought about Toca Boca in a good five or seven years as our two children grew into teenagers and abandoned the innocence of the Toca Boca universe for the abyss that is social media and as grating <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GB-R--6hY4w" target="_blank">as the “Toca Bocaaa!” mnemonic</a> got during those early years every time they opened one of their apps (and they opened them quite often), I now miss it. I did always enjoy their logo, with its joyous and infectious smile filled with rainbow-colored teeth. I'm not sure if it needed to be evolved but I don't mind at all that it has given that the evolution results in an equally pleasing logo, now with a crisper and bolder presence that gets rid of the shadow overlay effect and brings more attention to the teeth and tongue.<span></span> Shifting the wordmark to a geometric sans serif — Displaay's <a href="https://displaay.net/typeface/wallop/" target="_blank">Wallop</a> — in lowercase takes advantage of the insane amount of rounded characters in the name, which yield a super fun and playful rhythm in an otherwise dry wordmark — even the “t” is round-ish. The identity builds on Wallop as the sole typeface and, other than my personal distaste for the instances where the “n” shows up without a stem, it works perfectly well to represent Toca Boca, the parent company, in a serious way. Adding some playfulness is a set of squiggles inspired by the bounciness of their games and finger gestures made by users on the screens to make things move that are charming and fun.<span></span> The few applications shown are fine, mixing the type, squiggles, and bright color palette in straightforward compositions. The poster hints at something with far more potential with the squiggles interacting with the photography or a similar interaction happening between squiggle and type in the skateboard. Overall, it might seem like this is too serious and too grown-up of an identity for such a playful brand but given that this is the “corporate” identity <em>behind</em> the fun games for a younger audience, this has just the right amount of playfulness to let other grown-ups know what Toca Boca is about.</p>
