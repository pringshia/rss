                                            <p>Starting in 2021, Grubhub, an American online and mobile prepared food ordering and delivery platform, and Kroger, the biggest grocer in the United States by revenue, have been at it in the courts ever since Grubhub was acquired by Dutch company Just Eat Takeaway, <a href="https://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/new_logos_for_grubhub_and_seamless.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">which has applied its own logo to all of its subsidiaries around the world</a>. The crux of the matter is the fork-and-knife-inside-a-house icon that Just Eat Takeaway introduced in 2020 conflicting with the graphic in Kroger&#8217;s own subsidiary, <a href="https://cook.homechef.com/krogers-best-convenience" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Home Chef</a>, which launched in 2013 and was then acquired by Kroger in 2018, giving Home Chef&#8217;s logo a chronological advantage. Nonetheless, after a number of back-and-forth suits in which Kroger doesn&#8217;t want Grubhub to use their icon, the courts, as far as I understand, have continued to rule in favor of Grubhub.

Centered around an 'S' symbol that evokes the logic of trademarks, the identity strengthens the connection between them and the food brands they create and support.<br /><br />The concept helped to position them as curators of original food stories. We signaled this through bold language, typography, colours and a unique photographic approach that captures ingredients and dishes in fresh, unexpected ways.<br /><br />To support its core mission, Sessions also established Shelter Hall in Brighton, a dedicated space for testing and exploring new food concepts and experiences. With seven rotating kitchens and two bars, Shelter Hall builds on the language of the core identity while retaining a distinct and unique appearance.

                                            <p><strong>Opinion</strong><br />
                                            I'm not sure if it was on purpose but both the “S”s and the “E” in the old logo looked like hamburgers. If it was intentional, a tip of the hat; if it wasn't, those were some wonky “S”s. Still, it was an okay logo. The new logo adopts a bold, condensed grotesque, <a href="https://nguyengobber.com/typefaces/farmacia" target="_blank">Farmacia</a>, and pairs it with a regular sans serif for the “S” that has been drawn and enclosed in a circle to emulate a registered mark symbol (“®”). The idea makes sense, especially within the context that Sessions creates other food brands that are endorsed by the Sessions seal of approval — in this case, the “S” —  but the execution fails ever so slightly to deliver on the premise. It may be too literal and obvious but I don't see why the circled “S” couldn't have been lifted off the baseline so that it would rise above the cap height as most “®”s do. (&larr; Not ours, though, lol.) Nonetheless, it's a solid logo with a strong presence.<span></span> The identity is fine if a little on the sparse side but, then again, this is the parent company behind the consumer brands so it doesn't have to be too flashy. Using Farmacia throughout, the website and other digital applications basically serve as a delivery mechanism to promote the food brands through photography specific to those brands or through the Surrrealist-lite photography of foods that are floating in water and emitting smoke. The latter could have probably been pushed further into non-sensical territory but let's at least be glad these were not AI-generated. The identity extends nicely into <a href="https://shelterhall.co.uk/" target="_blank">the Shelter Hall brand</a> — look! there is the higher “S” symbol! — both online and in <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DGQjhdxiS1f/?hl=en" target="_blank">the physical space</a> that I want to be transported to right away. Overall, a rather difficult brief in terms of this being a parent company that wants and needs to be both behind the scenes and recognizable in front of said scenes so that customers of each of the different brand options can come to associate all those different brands with the one brand for all the brands. Told ya it was difficult.</p>

                                            <p>An eccentric range of packaging projects this week, with work from Florence, Sydney, and Melbourne.</p>
<span id="more-306315"></span>

<h1 class="friday_likes">Nazionale by Auge Design</h1>
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/friday_likes_nazionale.jpg" alt="Nazionale by Auge Design" />

<p style="margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;"><a href="https://www.instagram.com/nazionale_spiritoitaliano/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nazionale</a> is a new spirit brand in Italy offering contemporary takes on two classics: amaro and limoncello. The packaging, designed by Florence, Italy-based <a href="https://auge-design.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Auge Design</a>, exudes vintage Italian goodness with its crisp script wordmark that would fit perfectly within the pages of Louise Fili&#8217;s <a href="https://www.louisefili.com/graficadellastrada" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Grafica della Strada</em></a>. That curly “z” is to die for and the whole rhythm, slant, and proportion of the wordmark is perfectly executed. In case you are thinking it, yes, the labels on the bottle and graphics on the boxes are meant to look like humans, specifically foosball humans that, as Auge shares, were “inspired by the uniquely Italian social ritual of foosball in neighborhood bars”. It&#8217;s an unexpected source of inspiration and one that is translated with surprising sophistication given its lowbrow provenance. The spherical cap is such a fun treatment that literally seals the deal for me. <span class="pagination_divider"></span><span class="small_caps"><a href="https://www.behance.net/gallery/224299905/NAZIONALE" target="_blank" rel="noopener">See full project</a></span></p>

<h1 class="friday_likes">Rolus by Re</h1>
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/friday_likes_rolus.jpg" alt="Rolus by Re" />

<p style="margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;"><a href="https://rolus.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rolus</a>, a direct to consumer brand in the U.S., is a sparkling botanical drink with a citrus twist and champagne-like bubbles that is sugar-free, gluten-free, and alcohol-free. The packaging, designed by <a href="https://www.re.design/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Re</a> (not sure which of its many offices), features a thin yet oversized “R” floating in the middle of the can and is the main reason I was attracted to this project as it&#8217;s a rather unique and unconventional primary graphic for the beverage-in-a-can category. On the packaging, the “R” wraps within it “Never Still” repeated ad nauseam but in application, different messages and additional graphics can flow through it. It also makes for a pretty cool brand asset that can come to life <a href="https://images.prismic.io/reagency/Z_c8JuvxEdbNO0qr_Rolus_Carousel_6.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in different ways</a>. Complementing the “R” is the name typeset in a thin sans serif which would have been perfectly fine had it stuck to the deadpan vibe alone but it has some rather questionable serifs on the “L” and the “U” (which you can see in detail on the footer of Rolus&#8217; website) that don&#8217;t really add anything. I could also do without all the hand-drawn typography on the website and the influencer-ish social media content, which might make you wonder why this is even on Friday Likes if there are so many elements I don&#8217;t like. It&#8217;s because of the “R”. I really like that “R”. <span class="pagination_divider"></span><span class="small_caps"><a href="https://www.re.design/work/rolus" target="_blank" rel="noopener">See full project</a></span>

<h1 class="friday_likes">Varvatsi Caviar by Galima&amp;Pavla</h1>
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/friday_likes_varvatsi.jpg" alt="Varvatsi Caviar by Galima Akhmetzyanova and Pavla Chuykina" />

<p style="margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:30px!important;"><a href="https://emperogourmet.com/collections/caviar" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Varvatsi Caviar</a>, formerly known as Tsar Caviar, is a Brooklyn-based purveyor of caviar originating from a sturgeon farm in the Caspian Sea. The packaging, designed by Sydney and Melbourne, Australia-based <a href="https://www.galimaandpavla.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Galima&amp;Pavla</a>, fits pretty much within the standards and expectations of what caviar should look like: expensive, high-end, ornate, and exotic. However, not all caviars feature a pirate riding a sturgeon backwards while holding a telescope which is one of the main reasons we find ourselves here today. Named after Ioannis Varvakis, an eighteenth-century Greek “pirate, merchant, and philanthropist”, the titular character is supported by some excellent script typography, filigrees, and a sturdy geometric sans, all deployed with a glossy, raised varnish on a lovely range of background colors. Other than more Ioannis-riding-the-sturgeon graphics, I&#8217;m satisfied.  <span class="pagination_divider"></span><span class="small_caps"><a href="https://www.behance.net/gallery/218849451/Varvatsi-Caviar" target="_blank" rel="noopener">See full project</a></span></p>

                                            <p>James I. Bowie digs into the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office records to find out how often numbers, on their own, are used as logos. To put things in perspective, he found that there have been a total of 7,183 trademark applications for logos consisting solely of a stylized letter “A” while only 466 applications have been filed for logos consisting solely of the number “1”, which is the most popular of all numbers. Aside from the examples he cobbled together above, I was hard-pressed to think of any others… 7 Eleven but that&#8217;s about it.

The redesigned logo is the centre of it all as it reinterprets Ferm Living’s previous logo, the iconic bird motif, which has then been translated and implemented across touchpoints.<br /><br />A new colour palette and revised typography strengthen Ferm Living's identity. The soft curves and sharp edges of the typography balance warmth and modernity. Four core colours ensure a basic and recognisable expression across all communication, complemented by dynamic seasonal colours.

                                            <p><strong>Opinion</strong><br />
                                            For a company selling high-end furniture, the old logo was far too cutesy and unsophisticated to match the prices or the actual design and production of their various pieces — it was literally “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNpIOlDhigw" target="_blank">Put a Bird on it!</a>” but without the irony. Aside from that, the execution was pretty bad too with some terrible kerning and the tiniest “LIVING” possible. The new logo is a huge improvement, releasing the bird into the wind with a far more interesting rendition in a Henri Matisse-esque style that is charmingly abstract. Lo and behold, the bird is facing left, as opposed to right for, you know, momentum and the decision works quite well in this case. The wordmark shifts into an all-uppercase setting and gives the two words in the name equal prominence, set in a simple yet elegant flared serif. The wide spacing between the two lines of text and the icon yields an unusual (in a positive way) lock-up. The horizontal, single-line lock-up is well resolved too.<span></span> The identity is fairly straightforward and doesn't try to do more than it needs to, sticking to a limited color palette of black and different shades of warm grays along with <a href="https://commercialtype.com/catalog/canela" target="_blank">Canela</a>, which is never not a good choice when you want to easily signal quality and craftsmanship without being obnoxious or ostentatious about it. All of the applications shown follow a simple centered arrangement using the two logo lock-ups freely — bonus points for playing with the two words when they are more widely separated in the stacked version — and taking advantage of the icon's strength to use it on its own. Overall, the evolution brings the logo and identity to the same level of quality and design as the products Ferm Living offers and it does so with a warm, comforting, and inviting presence.</p>

                                            <p><a href="https://airestech.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Aires</a> is an Ontario, Canada-based EMF protection company that creates consumer products to mitigate the effects of everyday radiation for individuals, families, and communities. The company&#8217;s story started in the early 1990s but took a significant turn in 2012 when they brought military-grade technology aimed at protecting military personnel from radar emissions to the consumer market. I won&#8217;t pretend to understand the science, but they create nanometer-thin silicon resonator chips that neutralizes harmful EMFs (found in everything from microwave ovens to laptops, cell towers to smartphones), and they embed the chips in phone-specific stickers, person-specific keychains/necklaces, and room-specific devices. Following a recent surge in global sales, Aires has introduced a new identity designed by Montreal, Quebec-based <a href="https://www.auguststrategy.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">August</a>.</p><span id="more-306237"></span>

<blockquote>
Our strategy was rooted in clarity: distilling complex science into an intuitive brand experience that resonates across audiences. We refined the visual identity with warmth and precision, reimagined product packaging for retail viability, and created a modular digital ecosystem that helps users understand the tech, explore the benefits, and feel confident in their purchase.
<br /><br />
We took a thoughtful approach to evolving the Aires logo—retaining the recognizable icon while refining its construction and reducing its weight for improved legibility across applications. Paired with a modernized wordmark set in a new typeface, the result is a cleaner, more versatile logo that feels aligned with the brand’s renewed sense of clarity and credibility.

<p>At first glance, the old identity had some nice considerations: a circular container that evokes a sense of protection, a pattern that mimics electronic waves, and a decent lockup. However, it doesn&#8217;t take long for one to see some head-scratching decisions. The stroke on the icon is too thick (creating some small counterspaces) and the lines are not consistent (resulting in some irregular counter shapes). There is a lot of space between the icon and the wordmark. The typeface reads a little too playful for a science-oriented technology company. And the black/blue color combo feels dated. For all of these reasons, I agree with the desire to move on from this.</p>

<p>The evolution feels like a glass of clear water. It is open and clean. And, while similar, it feels completely different. The icon had some major cosmetic work. The slimmer stroke opens up the counters. The slight icon rotation provides a better baseline for the text to align against; the new typeface is larger, capitalized, and feels more sophisticated; and I really like how the &#8220;ir&#8221; combination sits together. (And yes, I know there is a massive ink trap in yet another digital-first brand, but I am willing to look past it in this instance because the overall impression is a welcome relief.)</p>

<p>That said, keen-eyed observers may have noticed that the icon animation is oriented to the old position, instead of the new rotation.</p>

<figcaption>Positioning.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>As a generally suspicious person, I had a lot of questions as I read up on this company. While I can&#8217;t speak to the efficacy of the products, I was able to find answers to my curiosities about the why/how/what this is supposed to do. That felt like a reason to give a nod to the overall positioning. The science behind the products seem complicated, but &#8220;the digital wellness device to level you up&#8221; makes sense with a simplicity that few wellness/tech companies achieve.</p>

<blockquote>
We approached the evolution of Aires’ visual identity with intention—drawing inspiration from the brand’s existing foundation while reimagining it into something entirely new. By refining what worked and introducing a modern system of typography, a calming-yet-confident colour palette, and flexible layout structures, we brought clarity to complexity and warmth to innovation. The result is a brand that feels trustworthy, accessible, and unmistakably future-forward.

<p>The type is set in <a href="https://www.apextypefoundry.com/typefaces/#practical" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Practical Grotesk</a> by Apex Type Foundry. Part of the Swiss typography lineage, this neo grotesque typeface offers a wide range of weights, ligatures and alternates, yet has the warmth necessary for a wellness brand. All in, a nice flexible heavy-use typeface.</p>

<p>There is a strong reliance of cream and black in the brand that I don&#8217;t mind. The orange and green add some required punches. Those work too. However, I don&#8217;t like how close the mauve and slate start to feel. I think part of the issue is that they start at 80% and 70% Pantone tints respectively, so the other colors want to outshine them. I can see their potential but also feel like there is an argument to be made for replacing them with one strong color. Or at least, two distinct colors.</p>

<p>I like the icon construction, particularly the level of detail feels appropriate. The representations all read well, particularly the loss of concentration and anxiety icons. I do find myself looking for an underlying system that explains the difference between icons within a circle versus those that are free standing.</p>

<blockquote>
To bring the new Aires brand to life across every touchpoint, we developed a scalable image system designed to flex from campaign to conversion. Our content strategy balances elevated brand storytelling with practical, real-world application—pairing aspirational campaign imagery with lifestyle, product, and creator-led content. 
<br /><br />
Each content type was crafted to meet users where they are in the funnel, increasing awareness, deepening consideration, and driving purchase. By art directing a new hero campaign in partnership with Montreal photographer Vincent Castonguay, we established a premium yet approachable aesthetic that sets Aires apart in the category. The result is a cohesive, visually compelling system that strengthens brand recognition, builds trust, and creates consistency across platforms.

To add texture, depth and brand recognition, we introduced a series of gradients inspired by EMF waves. This elegant device serves as a backdrop to content, giving static layouts a sense of motion. The system is comprised of four levels of gradients, increasing in intensity to match the wide array of products and protection Aires offers.

<blockquote>
Aires’ new packaging brings the brand’s innovation to life—visually and verbally. By refining the messaging and introducing a sleek, gradient-led system, we’ve created a packaging experience that not only informs but stands out—designed for today’s consumer and tomorrow’s retail shelves.

<p>Simply put, the packaging is beautiful. The use of textures, product photography, and text work together perfectly. </p>

We designed a flexible set of social media templates that translate Aires’ refreshed identity into everyday content. From education to engagement, the toolkit ensures consistency while giving the in-house team the freedom to move fast and communicate clearly.

<p>I understand the need to provide flexibility and variation within social media, but I much prefer the type of restraint shown in the packaging. These examples start to wander around a bit. Perhaps the same variation could be achieved (with a more consistent rhythm) if there was a clear underlying grid to help maintain placements of the different assets.</p>

Built on Shopify, the new Aires Tech site blends clarity with flexibility. We simplified complex information through intuitive design, while developing custom modules to give the team control and consistency. The result is a site that educates new users, supports conversion, and scales with the brand.

<p>While I already mentioned my experience with the website, I will say again that the overall architecture and content formatting are both well done. Visually, I would love to see more of the textures, icons and lifestyle photography throughout. After reviewing everything, it feels like those are the obvious missing pieces.</p>

<p>The advertisements are nice, but they also feel like they are missing a punch. Maybe they are trying to do too much: explain the problem, explain the product, offer a solution, etc. But I feel like I&#8217;d miss them. They are well designed and fit within the system; they just don&#8217;t pop for me. It might be because I am seeing these calm ads next to the UFC fight photo, but the ads might be the one place where it makes sense to be a bit more provocative or energetic.</p>

<p class="end">Overall, the identity has taken a major step forward. Not only did they breathe life into a stale logo, but they also created an identity that matches it in sophistication and poise. I&#8217;d love to see the socials and ads have a bit more focus, but those can and will continue to evolve over time&#8230;they always do. Regardless, Aires looks good with an identity that feels purposeful and professional.</p>
