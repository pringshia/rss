The “logo” was designed on a 150-by-150-pixel canvas at 72dpi and it&#8217;s then resized up to whatever application  is needed, including <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C7wU-IyRXeU/?hl=en&#038;img_index=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">giant stage drapes</a>.

Due to the internationalization need we advised the accent on “Hércules” to be removed — and as it did before, the same “H” present on the word mark continues to be isolated in a protective rectangle — but now it’s moved to the right of the word mark to avoid a double H reading.<br /><br />Hercules’ verbal language also evolves to speak about it’s challenges and roles front and center around the idea of “Courage to go further” — one that embraces how serious the challenge of protecting bodies of men and women on a daily basis.

                                            <p><strong>Opinion</strong><br />
                                            I have to open with a useless association but one that for some reason is embedded in my psyche, which is that whenever I hear or read the word “Hercules”, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZoXbsBoohJk" target="_blank">this scene from <em>The Nutty Professor</em></a> plays in my head for days on end. I told you, useless. Moving on.<span></span> I think we can all agree the old logo was bad but, man, it was <em>awesome</em> — just completely bonkers. By all common standards, though, it wasn't good, especially for a company making protective gear and construction equipment. It didn't quite convey “safety”. And that poor “H” could barely fit in the holding shape. The new logo pays better homage to its name, with a strong and sturdy wordmark that adds some unexpected straight edges where curves would be. It's an effective treatment in the “C” and “U” but the “S” almost looks like the vectors got mistakenly out of place and while I really like the tapering on the vertical strokes of the “H”, looking great on the monogram, it makes the “H” look a little heavier in the wordmark. Still, a major improvement and a solid logo at first glance. <span></span> Not every project has a budget for it and perhaps we are even in an era where this is overused but a custom typeface based on the logo could have been a pretty cool asset for the identity instead of the choice of <a href="https://www.myfonts.com/collections/eina-font-textaxis" target="_blank">Eina</a>, which is a lovely sans serif but one that doesn't quite convey the strength of the name of the company or of its products. I mean, it's fine but it feels more corporate or even Big Pharma-esque when there was an opportunity to be more industrial; part of that vibe might be due to the primary blue and green colors. There are also some graphics that blend a straight line into an ellipsis through some funky combination of positive and negative spaces where it's hard to tell where something starts or ends. It's a little gratuitous due to its lack of relation to anything else going on. Nonetheless, everything has a professional look and even without knowing what the old identity looked like I can only imagine this is a huge improvement that is better suited to present Hercules to new markets.</p>

Each country is represented by a singer performing an original song and then the viewing public selects the winner. Nearly 200 million people watch the televised event, which itself is quite a spectacle. (<a href="https://eurovision.tv/story/eurovision-2024-breaks-new-records" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Here</a> are the very detailed ratings across mediums for the 2024 edition.) One of the world’s longest-running live annual TV events, each edition’s host is determined by the winner of the previous edition so with Swedish artist Loreen’s win at Liverpool in 2023, Sweden hosted the event this past May in Malmö. (Spoiler: Switzerland won for the third time). The identity for this year’s event was designed by Stockholm, Sweden-based <a href="https://www.boldscandinavia.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bold Scandinavia</a>.</p>

<blockquote>[The] competition’s 68th edition in Sweden was in search of a strong progressive visual brand that thrusts it into the future, while also embracing the countless different ways that viewers interact with it in today’s world.<br /><br />Three main goals shaped the overall approach to this brief: first, to bring a contemporary Swedish sensibility to Eurovision by amplifying clean, intentional design; second, to spotlight a wide array of bright vibrant colours as a break from the visual conventions of previous editions; and most importantly, to adopt a system-first perspective that prioritises adaptability and coherence across stage, television and environmental touchpoints.<br /><br />‘The Eurovision Lights’ was our answer to this question — a concept built purely on simple linear gradients that take their inspiration from the vertical lines that permeate both the northern lights and sound equalisers, remixed in the neon-pop colours of the Eurovision core brand palette. The minimalism of these gradients contrasts with its maximalist visual impact, forming the basis of a versatile system that can effortlessly flex from expressive to subdued, motion to static, digital to print whilst never looking the same.</blockquote><h3><a href="https://www.boldscandinavia.com/work/eurovision-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bold Scandinavia project page</a></h3>

<p>I&#8217;ve covered the Eurovision identities <a href="https://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/?s=eurovision" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on and off over the years</a> and they are always entertaining; even the ones I didn&#8217;t cover (for lack of case study at the time or lack of awareness it happened on any given year) had something unique about them, like last year&#8217;s collaboration between Design Bridge and Partners (then known as Superunion*) and Starlight Creative with the concentric, extruding heart graphics.</p>

<p>While previous years have had a “logo” or main graphic that attached to <a href="https://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/new_logo_for_eurovision_song_contest_by_storytegic.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Eurovision logo that remains constant</a> across years, with the heart changing to feature the host country&#8217;s flag, this year there wasn&#8217;t a hero graphic but a collection of linear gradients in pop-tastic colorful combinations arranged in simple horizontal and vertical compositions dynamically offset by the animations that bring them to life in exciting ways.</p>

<p>The concept, combining audio waveforms with the flow and blurriness of the Northern Lights is simple and satisfying. I would have loved to see more adherence <a href="https://www.google.com/search?sca_esv=951454d4e44807ae&#038;sca_upv=1&#038;sxsrf=ADLYWILvXLKEL0Xxtzs0LsD8dtnxJSGvlA:1720606239173&#038;q=northern+lights&#038;udm=2&#038;fbs=AEQNm0Aa4sjWe7Rqy32pFwRj0UkWd8nbOJfsBGGB5IQQO6L3J5MIFhvnvU242yFxzEEp3BekApeLFCP-yt1rlLqzmhw_6n_rkq4R3i0PD0AzkF3JtEFi79E5TkRmHba99OHXdjzfZ9GYQHKuIKPXytBflxhBg3S3NvOwEqwtD1jpmCxWB_YarTSG3GfONuWeF1fGtRwo7y4iR1L6iRVUtZAsDo1l40G4IQ&#038;sa=X&#038;ved=2ahUKEwjQq7zdnZyHAxUZ5MkDHYONCj0QtKgLegQIEhAB&#038;biw=1762&#038;bih=1149&#038;dpr=2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to their color palette of black, greens, purples, and pinks</a>, but I very much get how that would have yielded a more limited (and perhaps gloomy) expression than the direction they correctly chose.</p>

<p>The gradient approach has some nice flexibility, whether in the waveforms or the very successful adaptation to each country&#8217;s flag colors. The treatments above left are excellent.</p>

<blockquote>The use of Herb Lubalin’s classic typeface ITC Avant Garde adds a tinge of 70s retro by paying homage to the decade that saw the rise of legendary pop group ABBA, who won Eurovision for Sweden 50 years ago in 1974.</blockquote><h3><a href="https://www.boldscandinavia.com/work/eurovision-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bold Scandinavia project page</a></h3>

<p>The choice of <a href="https://www.myfonts.com/collections/avant-garde-gothic-font-itc?refby=ucllc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ITC Avant Garde</a> is alright. I don&#8217;t love it, I don&#8217;t hate it. It pairs well with the graphics but I would have loved to see something less… dusty. Especially with so many great typefaces available by Swedish type designers (perhaps most obviously, <a href="https://lettersfromsweden.se/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Letters from Sweden</a>) but the reasoning — “Because ABBA” — makes it an open-and-shut case; impossible and futile to challenge.</p>

<p>While the static layouts are very pleasing — as you saw in the advertising samples and as you&#8217;ll see in the additional images below — it&#8217;s in motion and adapted to the stage where the identity really, well, <em>sings</em>. <a href="https://www.voguescandinavia.com/articles/eurovision-2024-360-stage-design-lighting-green-wall-design" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Adapting to Florian Wieder&#8217;s stage design</a>, the Eurovision Lights become a dizzying, hypnotic, and electrifying element that activates the stage for live attendees and home viewers in a mesmerizing and awesome way. The few glimpses of when country colors get integrated (like when Finland shows up) is also pretty great.</p>

<p class="end">The static applications work best when the elements are “compartmentalized”, whether it&#8217;s in the cool sign that embeds a different gradient color combo in each box or some of the boxy layouts (<a href="https://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/eurovision_2024_advertising_03.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">like this one</a>) as those create some more interesting tension than when a gradient composition is used to fill a single panel with type on top of it. Overall, it&#8217;s all very well executed and highly flexible for the myriad needs of the event and while at times, especially in motion on the stage, it borders on too much, if there is one event where too much is not enough it is the Eurovision Song Contest.</p>

As fun as that sounds, for now, the only real physical demonstration is the laptop video above right. The rest of the examples are digital animations made to look like the type is reacting to light. It&#8217;s a fun gimmick but perhaps too ahead of its time.

                                            <p><strong>Opinion</strong><br />
                                            The old logo wasn't great but it wasn't terrible either. The sprouting microphone in the icon was a somewhat decent idea to tie the name with the podcast theme but it was a little too cutesy. The wordmark was typeset in a clunky sans serif and the kerning was non-existent. The new logo is far more polished in all aspects but it did lose its instant association with podcasting by exchanging the microphone for a lightning bolt, which isn't entirely a bad thing as now the icon is almost a rebus for the name, with the bolt equaling <em>electricity</em>, equaling <em>buzz</em>. The microphone could have also been seen as a limitation, given that Buzzsprout isn't about the recording phase but about everything that comes before and after so, again, not entirely a bad thing to drop that visual.<span></span> The wordmark is quite nice, especially with the “z”s matching almost in parallel the angles of the bolt and echoing its sharpness. There was <em>almost</em> a lightning bolt in the counterspace between the two “z”s and while it was probably tempting to make it stand out, it would have been too forced and too distracting. To contrast the roundedness of the  type in the wordmark, the identity adopts the quirky and fun <a href="https://radimpesko.com/fonts/girott" target="_blank">Girott</a> for headlines, which is then complemented by <a href="https://commercialtype.com/catalog/graphik" target="_blank">Graphik</a>, which is fine but starts to feel a little default-y. The green on green color palette is always a good option and it works quite well with the typography. A highlighter kind of treatment is added to emphasize words with its edges angled like the bolt — it makes sense but it might be a little forced. Overall, a relatively simple identity with some solid choices that add up to a lively and energetic presence for Buzzsprout.</p>
