                                            <p>(Est. 2010) &#8220;At <a href="https://www.edelements.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Education Elements</a>, we believe the future of K-12 education lies in embracing the unique needs of every district. Traditional, one-size-fits-all approaches have failed to deliver meaningful results, leaving educators struggling to address the challenges of the ‘Age of Local.’ That’s why we’ve reimagined K-12 change management to close the Localization Gap—the disconnect between the customized strategies districts need and the outdated solutions they’ve been given. At our core, we are committed to empowering district leaders with the tools, strategies, and support they need to drive lasting change. By aligning every initiative with the unique needs of the communities we serve, we ensure every student has the opportunity to reach their full potential. Together, we’re shaping the future of K-12 education—because real change happens when it’s made local.&#8221;</p>

                                            <p><strong>Relevant quote</strong><br /><em>Our work started by naming the problem Education Elements solves for schools. We called it the Localization Gap—a recognition that it takes the entire community to improve education (not top-down bureaucracy), yet the tools for this simply don’t exist. We went on to tell a story of how Education Elements is fixing this with a core ethos: Real change. Made Local. This simple, powerful idea embodies the company’s process of putting the values of teachers, parents, school leaders, and students at the center of every solution. Because when the whole district pulls for a shared vision, every classroom improves.<br /><br />Next came design. The modern typeset and negative space evoke visionary confidence, while the hand-drawn highlights reflect the brand’s human-centered and educational purpose. Red and blue primary colors are offset by softer shades, reminding us that community needs are complex and varied. The geometric shapes and accent textures are each unique, like every student.

                                            <p><strong>Opinion</strong><br />
                                            The old logo was quite bad, with some painfully spaced typography as the two lines were forced to be the same width and a rather aggressive-looking icon that was impossible to discern what it was. The new logo is a vast visual improvement although not perfect and also a little ambiguous in its own way. Mainly the icon that is simply described as “negative space” that “[evokes] visionary confidence” — huh? — and that we are left to figure out on our own. I see a series of steps and an abstract “E”, which may be exactly the concept but also perhaps not at all and there is never really any pay-off for it at any point in the identity. It's a nice little graphic though. The wordmark uses a sans serif with extra thick ink traps and they are distracting, unnecessary, and have no visual or conceptual tie-in to either the icon or anything else happening in the identity. In principle, though, the two elements are fine and an undeniable improvement over the old.<span></span> The application goes in a whole other direction than anything the logo may have established and adopts <a href="https://commercialtype.com/catalog/marr_sans" target="_blank">Marr Sans Condensed</a> as the primary typeface which is simply one of the best grotesques in the game and hard to go wrong with as a choice — plus, we are spared from the ink-trap-y typeface. In headlines, the type is spiced up with a colorful highlighter treatment that we've seen before a number of times but one little distinction in this case, that I really like, is that the highlight only covers the x-height of the lowercase letters so there is some nice tension with the ascenders and descenders that are not covered by it. Some geometric shapes — because K to 12 — are added into the mix and rendered in a combination of flat colors, strokes, and textured fills. They are charming, playful, and they make for some fun compositions either as accents, like in the banners, or as holding shapes, like in the ID badge.<span></span> All of the elements — save for the wordmark — come together quite nicely in the website, which offers a bold and colorful yet airy and soothing browsing experience. Overall, this has a youthful vibrancy tempered with some academic rigor that should certainly help the organization help school districts help children help the future.</p>

                                            <p>Some fun packaging projects this week — after a two-week Friday Likes hiatus — with work from Toulouse, Vancouver, and London.</p>

<h1 class="friday_likes">Minifundi by Brand Brothers</h1>
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/friday_likes_minifundi.jpg" alt="Minifundi by Brand Brothers" />

<p style="margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;"><a href="https://www.instagram.com/minifundi.coffee/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Minifundi</a> is a specialty coffee roaster and café in Toulouse, France, that is housed in a former car garage in the city&#8217;s Bonnefoy district. The identity, designed by Paris- and Toulouse-based <a href="https://brandbrothers.studio/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Brand Brothers</a>, takes a cue from its grungy, industrial, hard-edged space to produce a chunky wordmark constructed from straight lines only. I wish the “M” and “N” followed the same treatment as the “U” and the “D” with the faceted, fragmented curves but it&#8217;s still a fun wordmark and the unicase approach to the “i”s adds some fun texture to it. Part of what makes the logo work so well is its application to rugged surfaces like the café&#8217;s concrete exterior or the burlap bags where its thick consistency is put to the test. The packaging is nice but the happy color palette maybe takes some of the brute force out of the logo and a more monochromatic or garage-y look could have been cooler. The supporting condensed sans serf type in the labels and other applications is a great contrast to the logo and put to good use throughout the identity. <span class="pagination_divider"></span><span class="small_caps"><a href="https://brandbrothers.studio/minifundi-identite-visuelle-branding-typographie/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">See full project</a></span></p>

<h1 class="friday_likes">Street Legal by Best Studio</h1>
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/friday_likes_streetlegal.jpg" alt="Street Legal by Best Studio" />

<p style="margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;"><a href="https://www.instagram.com/streetlegalbeer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Street Legal</a> is a “dealcoholized” range of beers produced by Central City Brewers and Distillers in Surrey, British Columbia, Canada. The packaging, designed by Vancouver, BC-based <a href="https://beststudio.ca/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Best Studio</a>, introduces a devilishly charming character that is half prankster, half secret spy agent, and half smooth operator (which I realize is one too many halves) that cavorts around the packaging in a vintage cartoon style. The dense layouts with clunky (on purpose) blocks of typography and a few other illustrative elements have a super fun, chaotic presence. The single color approach of the artwork on different color backgrounds is perfectly executed and further adds to the old-school vibe. Having this much fun on a non-alcoholic beer should be illegal. <span class="pagination_divider"></span><span class="small_caps"><a href="https://www.behance.net/gallery/226339507/Street-Legal-Rebrand" target="_blank" rel="noopener">See full project</a></span>

<h1 class="friday_likes">Mount Sapo by STUDIO WAN</h1>
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/friday_likes_mountsapo.jpg" alt="Mount Sapo by STUDIO WAN" />

<p style="margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:30px!important;"><a href="https://mountsapo.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mount Sapo</a> is a skincare brand handmade in Dorset, UK, currently offering an “All-Over Oil” and “All-Rounder Balm” using essential oils that are 100% organic, sustainably sourced, and derived from plants. The packaging, designed by London, UK-based <a href="https://www.studiowan.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">STUDIO WAN</a>, revolves around a gooey, drippy wordmark set in an uplifting upwards angle that is contrasted by some slick minimalism in its application as the two flagship products come in deadpan, unadorned structures and only the bare minimum of a supporting monospace typeface, <a href="https://klim.co.nz/retail-fonts/pitch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pitch</a>, to accompany it and all rendered in a single color. My favorite part of the project might be the tape and how it&#8217;s applied to the shipping packaging to add some fun branding to the otherwise barebones box. <span class="pagination_divider"></span><span class="small_caps"><a href="https://www.studiowan.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">See full project</a></span></p>

                                            <p><strong>Relevant quote</strong><br /><em>The new branding evokes the ever-changing technology by morphing the square and circle shapes in the old logo into a new and mutant identity that is dynamic and adaptable.<br /><br />Our first move was dropping the meaningless symbol and creating separate versions for each language, increasing the readability and recognition. By simplifying the composition, the small dot gained room and visibility, becoming the starting point of an entire visual universe.<br /><br />We developed a graphic language, both static and in motion, in which the square and circle gain volume, creating a visual universe that is both abstract and tangible, as it is software and hardware.

                                            <p><strong>Opinion</strong><br />
                                            The old logo was relatively fine and actually did a good job of integrating the English and Arabic versions into a single composition, unified by the monogram encapsulated in a holding shape that matched the height of the two wordmarks combined. The monogram itself — despite being labeled as “meaningless” by Farelo Studio — was a rather decent solution to, again, mixing the two languages/scripts as the initial “T”s came together. Nonetheless, it did feel like it was missing some presence given how thin everything was and the new, separate logos fix that with some newfound personality.<span></span> The letterforms are bold, crisp, and angular but contrasted through some generously rounded curves on the exterior contours. The “o” keeps the little dot in its counterspace, which adds some distinction even if it remains unclear what purpose it serves or what meaning it conveys. The execution across both languages is great — obviously I don't know the first thing about Arabic scripts but the graphic relationship is clearly there. The one small critique I would have is that the “o” ends up looking a little small and narrow compared to the other letters… I understand the desire to keep the counterspace a perfect square but then, perhaps, making the other letters less square would have been beneficial.<span></span> The square-circle symbiosis is expanded, literally, into a 3D sphere-cube treatment for some fun pattern-y animations. They may feel a little gratuitous but it's an IT company for corporations so there really isn't much visual inspiration to draw from so if you have to do something ambiguous, might as well make it engaging and while not revolutionary the animations are pleasing. I particularly like the 3D-ification of the infamous squircle shape. For the applications, some extra-high-fidelity renders of spheres, cubes, and <em>sphubes</em> (the 3D equivalent of the squircle) serve as eye-candy backdrops and they work quite well. The color palette of That Blue, a light blue, and a neon green yields some punchy applications although I'm not crazy about the techie-looking typeface chosen. Overall, this is a solid evolution in a category that is rarely exciting so any semblance of creativity is welcome and this delivers just enough.</p>

Robert Sibbald and Dr Andrew Balfour co-founded what would become RBGE in 1670 as a garden for growing medicinal plants as part of their efforts to modernise Scottish medicine. The garden was granted its Royal Warrant in 1699. It moved to its current location in 1820 where it occupies 70 acres only a mile from Edinburgh city centre. That’s some valuable real estate. Today the RBGE has four sites across Scotland, each with its specialist collection. (If you’re into liverworts, Dawyck is your place.) The brand update, <a href="https://www.rbge.org.uk/news/blog/we-are-rebranding/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">as explained by RBGE</a>, was driven by the need for the organization to “have more impact, be better understood and better supported” and to increase their “visibility and prominence in Scotland and globally, helping us to clarify what we do and why, and building towards our new vision of ‘a positive future for plants, people and the planet’”.</p>

<blockquote>
    The Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh hadn’t looked at their brand for over a decade, and in the face of two enormous challenges – a biodiversity crisis and climate emergency – they needed to have more impact, be better understood and better supported.
    <br><br>
    We began with a new a core idea – four gardens, one botanic world – which brings the gardens in Edinburgh, Benmore, Dawyck and Logan together, in just five words. Then their new brand strategy – developed by Winster Marsh – explains what they do and why it’s so important.

<p>The old logo looks like it wants to be a UK Government agency, which is weird because RBGE isn’t a government agency. The font is nice. The line is vertical. The icon is great. All together, it&#8217;s not fit for purpose anymore.</p>

<p>When I look at the new logo, I immediately think this is an organisation that&#8217;s got its act together and can be trusted with doing plant science while also providing a good day out for the family. The wordmark is strong. Its chiselled thick and thin strokes are all in the right places with barely-there flared serifs that are as gorgeous as they are subtle. The unusual icon placement works well, almost like an official seal.</p>

<p>The logos for the four gardens are consistent stacks, which they really weren&#8217;t before, as you will see below.</p>

<blockquote>
    The design phase began with an honest conversation about their legacy symbol, a drawing of a threatened alpine plant found in the Scottish Highlands called Sibbaldia procumbens. This takes its name from Robert Sibbald, who both discovered it and who founded the garden in Edinburgh.
    <br><br>
    There was little denying its relevance to their mission to ‘explore, conserve and explain the world of plants’, yet the old version was too complicated for a screen-based world. So bit by bit, leaf by leaf, we carefully redrew and simplified it.

<p>I’m about to give the icon a harsh pruning with the secateurs of critique. Before I do, I want to plant this in your mind: as a whole, this rebrand is a big success. Okay, here I go.</p>

<p>The old icon may not have functioned well digitally but it was lovely. It had a natural flow. It was heavily stylised, but it still felt like a real plant. When you get up close, though, the need for a rework becomes obvious. Besides the complexity, the vectors are janky and the flowers are too mechanical.</p>

    </figure>

<p>The new icon is not quite lovely and I don’t think it functions as well as it should. The stems are sturdier but the new flowers are just as mechanical and fragile as the old ones.</p>

<p>The three-pronged leaves seem to be copied, pasted and scaled. Look carefully and you’ll see they’re all different. But they don’t <em>feel</em> different. Same with the flowers, I thought, so I checked. They’re different too.</p>

<p>Somehow, even though everything is individually drawn, the way it all comes together feels clipart-y. Like most of the vector graphics you get from stock sites, the finish isn’t quite right. The uneven spacing of the six flowers doesn’t look purposeful. It looks like someone didn’t know how to divide 360° by six. I think the main problem is that the icon is clean, stark vector artwork. There is nowhere for its wonkiness to hide. Perhaps it would have achieved full loveliness if its design had been more informed by the strokes of the wordmark or if it had gone for a less perfect finish. (Whatever you do, DO NOT scroll to the end of this post right now to see the treat I have waiting for you.)</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not happy with it, but the icon looks great at first glance and when animated. A glance is all most people will give it, so it&#8217;s fine. (It&#8217;s totally not fine, but you know what I mean.)</p>

<p>The lovely flared serifs aren’t just for the wordmark. They are for everything, thanks to RBGE’s bespoke-ish font Sibbaldia (named after the <a href="https://www.inaturalist.org/taxa/79076-Sibbaldia-procumbens" target="_blank" rel="noopener">plant</a>). It’s a customised version of Tipographies’ <a href="https://tipografies.com/fonts/nomada?subfamily=incise" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nomada Incise</a>.</p>

<p>The animated growing ligatures are especially appropriate in this context. I hope the idea doesn’t stay in this context. Designers, take note and steal. I say yes to all beautiful ligatures no matter how gratuitous.</p>

<p>The growing animations theme continues with the main graphic device of the identity, a frame decorated with foliage and flowers of the <em>Sibbaldia procumbens</em> in the same style as the icon. Unfortunately, the decorations suffer from the same problems as the icon.</p>

<p>Johnson Banks didn&#8217;t share any information about colour. Here&#8217;s the palette as far as I can tell: The dark green is now a little deeper and a lot more prominent, to good effect. It&#8217;s paired with a classic off-white. The secondary bright green seems to be a little brighter than before. The frames can be bright green or pink or lavender or dark green or yellow or orange or coral or blue. Mostly, but not always, the frame colour is pulled from the photo it&#8217;s around. I have no idea if the frame can be any colour in the world or if there is a guiding principle behind the choices.</p>

<p>That, my friends, is a collection of painful sub-brands and very crowded collateral. One of the best things Johnson Banks has done here is give all the information room to breathe.</p>

<p>Speaking of breathing, I write in my very best tour guide voice, it&#8217;s time to head outside and breathe some fresh air while we look at the signage.</p>

<p>While it&#8217;s all good and works well, the typography is emerging as the star attraction, supported by… the photography:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.eilidhcameronphotography.com" traget="blank">Eilidh Cameron</a>&#8216;s photography is as it should be: vibrant, contrasty and heavy on chainsaws. The staff portraits make me want to be friends with all of them.</p>

<p>And then somehow the photo below got selected. Maybe everyone was too distracted by the bokeh and blossom to notice that it looks like they grabbed Dougal McSoil, who is an actual gardener, scrubbed him within an inch of his life, and told him to pretend that they’d hustled him out of the office and that he’d never ever in his short life held a rake.</p>

    <figcaption>&#8220;This is nae even a rake. It&#8217;s just a wee stick.&#8221; (Scotland, I&#8217;m so sorry.)</figcaption>

<p>The social media posts give us everything we&#8217;ve seen so far, plus one new thing.</p>

<p>The sideways type is fine, I guess. It&#8217;s the only way to do the really big type in tall layouts. I think it cheapens the feel of the typography a little though. What they should have done is change the way everyone on the planet uses phones so they could go big and <em>wide.</em></p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.rbge.org.uk" target="blank:" rel="noopener">actual website</a> doesn&#8217;t go all in on the custom font. It uses <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Public+Sans" target="blank" rel="noopener">Public Sans</a> for body copy. It&#8217;s a good pairing except in the top menu where they should have stuck with Johnson Banks&#8217; design.</p>

<p>The advertising is where I think this identity works best. The big single-word headlines playing with the photos are my second favourite part of this project. (Well done for still not scrolling ahead to see what&#8217;s at the bottom.)</p>

<p>A few branded objects:</p>

    <figcaption>Tote and wellies.</figcaption>
    </figure>

<p>The tote is a tote. The wellies are cute. Okay are you ready? RBGE has a <a href="https://www.rbge.org.uk/science-and-conservation/herbarium/" target="blank" rel="noopener">herberium</a>, a collection of preserved plants. The herberium has a stamp. The stamp contains the icon. The stamped icon makes me want to take back everything I wrote up at the top. Because the flaws that are obvious in the hard vectors disappear when the medium is ink applied to paper via rubber. Look at this!</p>

    </figure>

<p>I want some of these framed and on my wall. I want to hang out with the herberiumists and use their special leaf tape. I want to do the stamping!</p>

<p class="end">It&#8217;s not a perfect rebrand, but it&#8217;s really strong. I&#8217;d say the RBGE brand has jumped up a notch or two above the National Trust. That&#8217;s a good place to be in today&#8217;s getting-attention-so-you-can-get-support-to-do-your-science environment. Now if you&#8217;ll excuse me, I have to go order a stamp and aesthetically tape some leaves to paper.</p>

<p>A few things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Early-bird pricing will end June 27.</li>
<li>Unlike all previous conferences, there will NOT be a live webcast — we will be switching to our post-event remote access model.</li>
<li>If you are considering attending, get your <a href="https://underconsideration.com/brandnewconference/hotels.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hotel</a> sorted ASAP! Prices have gone up quite a bit over the course of 2025.</li>
<li>After a successful 2024 without sponsors, there will be no sponsors in 2025 either.</li>
<li>2024 was also a great first run of <a href="https://underconsideration.com/brandnewconference/the_fan_zone.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Fan Zone!</a> and we will keep iterating on it for 2025.</li>
<li>An explanation of this year&#8217;s steel-beam-inspired identity can be found <a href="http://www.underconsideration.com/brandnewconference/about_the_identity.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</li>
<li>Customized stencil version of Stringer Thin and optical refinement of the glyphs that will make up our hero logo compositions by <a href="https://order.design/otf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Order Type Foundry</a>.</li>

<p>Hope to see many of you there!</p>
