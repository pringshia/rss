                                            <p><strong>Opinion</strong><br />
                                            The old logo, typeset in what appears to be <a href="https://www.hvdfonts.com/fonts/brandon-grotesque" target="_blank">Brandon Grotesque</a>, was fine but nothing particularly special and, if I recall correctly, that typeface was everywhere in the 2010s, so it was a very safe choice. Now that Harry's has proved itself and risen to the top of the food chain in its category, “safe” wasn't going to cut it and this new flared serif wordmark clearly establishes the growth and maturity of the brand and its position as a quality product and a personality that is more human and handcrafted than the Gillettes and Schicks of the world. Execution-wise, it's nothing outstanding or stunning but nonetheless quite nice… the sloping bowl of the “R”s is a charming touch. A mammoth mascot that has made subtle but recurring appearances on Harry's products has also gotten a glow-up and it's delightful, with its <a href="https://www.google.com/search?sca_esv=a2fccd0347a25b28&amp;sxsrf=AHTn8zp8-_Do_A7w7AATEgVJf93d29MPQQ:1745412402771&amp;q=bantha&amp;udm=2&amp;fbs=ABzOT_CWdhQLP1FcmU5B0fn3xuWpA-dk4wpBWOGsoR7DG5zJBsxayPSIAqObp_AgjkUGqensJR8Rz2PphQzhi4JPzwOL41jAKImdqfcm5f6z1FIS-GbBb5IApvAgtMlNJVF1mkYQfgTXROsh45AExLIOP-gG5wqkGYbdsBrRaFczsiwukaj0rws8dJwI2YJZ8V_r4p5XSwh0l1b8EFHamX4HjWa_UwW4BQ&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwj50IPyl-6MAxXmHjQIHVirB3AQtKgLegQIERAB&amp;biw=1345&amp;bih=1049&amp;dpr=2" target="_blank">Bantha</a>-esque fur, tiny little toes, and glazed gaze. (Side note: Harry's parent company, Harry's Inc, also recently changed and adopted the name <a href="https://www.mammothbrands.com/" target="_blank">Mammoth Brands</a>, itself a cool redesign.)<span></span> Like the old logo, the old packaging was fine and, again, in contrast to Gillette and Schick packaging that have always looked more like motor oil than foams you want to put on your face, its simplicity stood out dramatically upon its introduction. While the minimalist approach remains, the whole packaging system has shifted into That Blue, which is never not a good choice when you want to stand out and, having seen the new Harry's starting to pop up in grocery stores, it works like a charm. It's impossible to miss it. The various container shapes and materials are all now perfectly unified under this brand color along with the logo rendered sideways, allowing it to show up bigger and bolder. The supporting typography within the packaging is fine but a little random and the scent illustrations, as cool as they are on their own, feel too organic and a little out of place but nothing too concerning. Overall, a vibrant, bold, and confident redesign that packs a punch on the shelf.</p>

                                            <p>Established in 2021, <a href="https://www.twelvelabs.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TwelveLabs</a> is a video intelligence platform that can “find anything, discover deep insights, analyze, remix and automate workflows with AI that can see, hear, and reason across your entire video content”. Launched originally by a team of twelve members — hence the name, I suppose — with research expertise spanning language, video, machine learning, and perception, TwelveLabs&#8217; platform can, in a nutshell and to the best of my understanding, analyze a video and then allow the user to search for a scene just by using text or generate text (as summary, chapters, or highlights) from the video or a bunch of other stuff way above my pay grade and ability to resume in language I (or you) can understand. In short, if you work with a lot of video and have ambitions to do more with it than just hit play, TwelveLabs is for you. As it scaled its product offering, research teams, and global reach, TwelveLabs has introduced a new identity designed by London, UK-based <a href="https://www.pentagram.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pentagram</a> partners Jody Hudson-Powell and Luke Powell.</p>

<blockquote>Rather than processing video frame-by-frame, TwelveLabs encodes it as a multidimensional block of data – compressing audio, text, movement, visuals and context into something that can be searched, navigated and understood. It’s like giving AI not just eyes and ears, but memory, intuition and intent, too.<br /><br />We turned this idea – video as volume – into the foundation for the new identity. If TwelveLabs’ models perceive time spatially, the brand should too. Threads of information pulse through layouts. Diagrams show video flowing across dimensions. Colour, movement and layout all work together to express a system in perpetual motion &#8211; smart, elegant, alive.</blockquote><h3><a href="https://www.pentagram.com/work/twelvelabs/story" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pentagram project page</a></h3>

<blockquote>TwelveLabs’ symbol, a galloping horse, nods to Muybridge’s early motion studies, but also signals the forward energy of the company itself. A marker of movement and intelligence, not just speed. We reinterpreted the horse as a modular, dimensional system that could animate through layouts, inform model architecture names and give rhythm to the wider brand.</blockquote><h3><a href="https://www.pentagram.com/work/twelvelabs/story" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pentagram project page</a></h3>

<p>With “Labs” in its name, the old logo very much looked like some kind of medical company or one of those places where you can go get bloodwork tests as that little squiggle in the circles looked like a heartbeat and the colors were downright clinical-looking. Nothing about it suggested video or AI or technology. The new logo introduces an awesome icon that pays homage to one of the earliest forms of motion studies, Eadweard Muybridge&#8217;s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Horse_in_Motion" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>The Horse in Motion</em></a>, a reference that may not be the most evident at first glance but even I, as someone that is not the most perceptive or fully cultured, got the reference.</p>

<p>At first I was thinking that that&#8217;s what the icon was meant to be and then I saw it in motion and was, like, “Yes!”. I love the digital, abstract re-interpretation of the horse… it&#8217;s really amazing that they were able to capture so much detail across 12 lines — ding ding ding, a clever nod to the name — using only rounded-corner rectangles strategically spaced out. And the animation? Sublime. The wordmark, typeset in the Duplex style of <a href="https://www.205.tf/milling" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Milling</a> is a perfect complement and companion with its matching rounded corners and sort of digital aesthetic.</p>

<blockquote>TwelveLabs’ new identity does more than simply represent the company’s technology – it helps explain it. At the centre is a diagram system that visualises the inner workings of the platform. Marengo is the encoder, compressing video into rich multimodal embeddings, seeing and hearing in equal measure. Pegasus is the reasoning model, traversing that data to identify events, context and intent. These models go beyond labelling – they interpret the ‘what’ and get to the ‘why’.</blockquote><h3><a href="https://www.pentagram.com/work/twelvelabs/story" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pentagram project page</a></h3>

<p>The identity elements are all excellent too, starting with the choice of Milling, which is the first I hear of it and that manages to work perfectly at both large sizes as headline type and at tiny sizes as part of the diagrammatic visual language. It has so much range and ample personality too. The color palette is a fun combination of pink, peach, and orange, accented by a bright neon green, which blend surprisingly convincingly into some groovy gradients. Type and color come together online in an unexpected way as live blocks of text on TwelveLabs&#8217; website suddenly come alive as colors illuminate it in a trailing effect. As something that could have been really annoying or distracting, it ends up being a very nice detail as you are browsing through their website.</p>

</figure>

<p>Things get extra trippy with the visualizations of the “Video as Volume” premise behind the platform and behind the brand idea. These chunks of blurry footage play with perspective and perception in the weirdest of ways and I love how the frames begin to extend into the depth of the 3D object. Even the blurry, halo-y effect on the edges is kind of cool and adds a bit of <em>Black Mirror</em>-y techie creepiness… which I mean in a complimentary way in that these little blocks look like the future somehow.</p>

<p>The soft bricks of volume can also be rendered in gradients without footage and arranged in DNA-like compositions that float and roam across screens. It&#8217;s a great way to embed these shapes into the design system without it getting too photo-heavy and they add an interesting ethereal quality to the applications. The typography works perfectly well throughout and the instances where it&#8217;s used small and in little pill-like shapes or accompanied by tiny icons, it looks extra science-y. If I had to pinpoint any misses I would say it&#8217;s the vertical lines used in some places where they feel a little gratuitous but, yeah, that&#8217;s just reaching as they are perfectly fine.</p>

This is the first of 15 dual-branded restaurants parent company Dine Brands Global has planned. (For our international readers who may not be familiar with these two brands: These are very popular national chains that are generally mediocre so the two of them together is… troubling.)

                                            <p><strong>Relevant quote</strong><br /><em>When Hovr came to us for a brand refresh, we knew the identity needed to reflect the layered, intuitive nature of their product. And because the interaction is simple on the surface—but not always easy to explain—we focused on finding a clear, succinct way to communicate both the company and the product.<br /><br />The design system is playful and always in motion, making it easy for hotels, restaurants, and other experiences to present their content in a simple, engaging way. Along the way, we also introduced Nimbus—Hovr’s new bird mascot. Birds hover, travel, and see the bigger picture, making Nimbus a fitting symbol for the brand’s spirit and functionality.

                                            <p><strong>Opinion</strong><br />
                                            The old logo, if we felt generous calling it a logo, was technically fine (because how hard can it be to screw up typesetting your name) but pretty much meaningless and devoid of any visual interest. The new logo introduces an origami-esque bird icon that ties in with the company's focus on the travel industry (because birds travel) which certainly adds a visual hook and a conceptual tie-in to the logo but it's still all somewhat ambiguous and the two elements have little visual relation. The drawing of the icon is also odd, with extremely sharp negative spaces and an odd mixture of straight lines and rounded corners. I'm also not quite clear what the paper/origami look is meant to achieve and while the logo animation could have helped pay it off, it sadly doesn't. The wordmark remains fine and forgettable.<span></span> I'm usually more enthused by projects' logos and then the applications can sometimes not be as engaging but here it's the other way around. The applications are actually far more interesting. The introduction of the vintage-travel-like stamp treatments is fun and relevant if perhaps a little clichéd for a travel-focused brand. The typography, mixing a sans serif with the italic of a serif works quite well as it usually does but it's a classic treatment deployed crisply in this identity. The motion behaviors are spry and engaging and the holding shapes for the imagery and information are actually kind of novel and unique. The icon set that <em>sort of</em> follows the aesthetic of the icon are weird though and further confuse about what the actual design idea behind these is because it's definitely not origami. Heck, maybe nothing was meant to evoke origami and I'm just too hung up on my own perception.<span></span> The layout compositions, the tone of voice, the visual language… it's all actually quite good but even after scrolling up and down a few times, it's really hard to tell what Hovr is or what it does and why would it be promoting on the streets. This is not the design's fault at all, to be fair… just one of those unexplainable companies. Overall, a well-manicured identity that adds some liveliness and warmth to what is essentially software that doesn't really take you, as a consumer, anywhere despite the appearance that it would.</p>

Known for helping high-performing individuals find purpose-driven roles, Purpose Talent turned to Studio Morfar to translate its deeply human mission into a distinctive visual and verbal identity. The result is a joyful, jazz-inflected brand world of movement, colour and rhythm — designed to evoke the feeling of fulfilment, not just depict the function of work.
<br /><br />
Purpose Talent’s new logo nods to the uniqueness of individuals. Each letterform is a little odd, a little offbeat, yet together they just work, acting as a visual metaphor for a well-matched team. Filling the negative space are ‘Doo-da’s’ – expressive squiggles and cut-outs inspired by Matisse, 70s/80s jazz record covers, and city pop album art, adding texture and emphasis across the identity.

<figcaption>Concept and logo rationale.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The previous logo for Purpose Talent was pleasant but generic: the name set in an elegant Didone-style serif that, while visually refined, didn’t offer much in the way of personality or conceptual weight. As is often the case with young companies, the initial identity leaned toward minimal risk and maximum legibility, serving its purpose (go ahead and take the lame pun) until the brand was ready to say something more distinctive.</p>

<p>The new logo ditches the polish in favor of play. A hand-drawn logotype introduces a lively rhythm to the letterforms — each one slightly offbeat, rightfully off-kilter, and delightfully off-script, yet harmonizing beautifully like the members of The Miles Davis Quintet — each with their own groove, but perfectly in sync. Kind of like a great team: the Developer who microwaves fish at lunch, the AD who insists on shorts in every season, and the PM with an unexplainable Tic-Tac collection — somehow, despite the idiosyncrasies, it just works. The descender of the “P” in “Purpose” cleverly extends into the “l” of “Talent,” a move that, on paper, should never work, but instead brings a remarkable sense of cohesion without tripping up readability.</p>

<p>Surrounding the type are small, swirling graphic elements dubbed “Doo-da’s” — repeating graphic elements that we’ll get into further down in the review — which make their debut right in the logo itself. These squiggles, along with a particularly animated “T,” with down/up serifs that make it look like a person in mid-boogie-woogie, set the tone for the entire brand system: playfully expressive, imperfectly human, and delightfully unbuttoned.</p>

<blockquote>
At the heart of the rebrand was one deceptively tricky question: how do you capture the feeling of fulfilment? Rather than leaning on tired tropes of people at desks or beanbag-filled offices, Studio Morfar embraced the abstract, crafting a visual world rooted in jazz, dance, and movement. 
<br /><br />
“Jazz became a core visual theme” says the studio’s creative director Torsten Power. “It’s expressive, collaborative, and there’s a rhythm and soul to it that mirrors how great teams work.”

<figcaption>Strategy.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Plenty of talent agencies <em>talk</em> about people; Purpose Talent actually <em>feels</em> like people. Studio Morfar’s strategy avoids tired business clichés and instead leans hard into emotional resonance. Rather than portraying candidates as stock-photo archetypes or reducing culture to ping-pong tables and kombucha taps, the brand captures something more abstract: the rhythm, joy, and movement of people doing fulfilling work. The tone is soulful and expressive, echoing the improvisational vibe of jazz: fluid, collaborative, and full of unexpected moments that somehow land perfectly. It’s less “join our team” and more “find your rhythm.” By grounding the voice in empathy and personality — not jargon — Purpose Talent puts the spotlight where it belongs: on real people, doing meaningful work, with purpose.</p>

Studio Morfar opted for a bespoke combination of playful, editorial-style lettering (Bea by Taylor Penton) and a cleaner secondary sans-serif font (Raleway). Type was treated as an illustrative element in its own right, rotating and rearranging like sound on the page.

<p>The brand’s visual toolkit is a masterclass in cheerful restraint. The color palette hits that elusive sweet spot: bright and buoyant, but with complex hues that keep it from veering into birthday party territory. Each hue feels considered — optimistic but grounded, warm without being cloying — like a high-five from someone who actually respects personal space.</p>

<p>The typography follows suit. Headline duties fall to <a href="https://www.taylorpenton.com/fonts/p/bea?srsltid=AfmBOoqa0hdO3L_s3LTraBpsKsLqv-38yChJzDaG94vhEht9fYY-G9PE" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bea,</a> a wonderfully oddball serif by <a href="https://www.taylorpenton.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Taylor Penton.</a> Bea’s roughened, hand-drawn energy aligns perfectly with the wobbly whimsy of the logotype, giving headlines a conversational cadence that feel as expressive as they are readable. Supporting it is <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Raleway" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Raleway,</a> the clean, slightly quirky sans-serif from <a href="https://fonts.google.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Fonts.</a> While Raleway is far more structured, it still plays nice with Bea’s looseness. Think of it as the bass player in a jazz band: steady, grounded, and giving the headliner room to riff.</p>

<p>And then there are the icons: hand-drawn, playful, and blessedly free of perfect circles and sterile geometry. These little glyphs echo the same aesthetic DNA as the rest of the system, adding visual rhythm and personality without feeling overworked. It’s a refreshing reminder that not everything in brand design needs to be vector-perfect to feel trustworthy. Just like people, a little wobble adds a lot of character.</p>

<blockquote>
Illustrations by <a href="https://www.instagram.com/con_mchugh" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Con McHugh</a> – who is known to record himself dancing to inform the movement in his work – bring the identity to life with characters grooving their way through the day: croissants flying, laptops mid-jump, and arms lifted in joy. These scenes aren’t literal depictions of work, but emotional ones that focus on capturing the spirit of what it feels like to do work that matters.

<p>The illustrations by 

<a href="https://www.instagram.com/con_mchugh" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Con McHugh</a> — yes, the same Con McHugh responsible for <a href="https://brandnewshop.underconsideration.com/products/the-that-blue-t-shirt" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Brand New’s “That Blue” swag series</a> — are wobbly, whimsical, and full of personality. They embody the brand’s spirit without falling back on the typical tropes of office life. Sure, there are laptops, and potted plants, and croissants, but these characters aren’t just <em>working</em> — they’re <em>feeling.</em> You can sense the joy in their movements, the pep in their step, the rhythm in their limbs. It’s not about the task at hand, it’s about the vibe — and this brand’s got it in spades.</p>

<p>Con’s simple-yet-expressive style is a perfect match for the rest of the visual identity. His hand-drawn linework syncs effortlessly with the logo’s quirky contours and the Bea typeface’s textured charm, all reinforcing the core idea that imperfection isn’t a bug — it’s a <em>feature.</em> Beyond just aesthetic alignment, though, his approach — rooted in rhythm, motion, and emotional storytelling — makes him an inspired choice for a brand built around helping people find their professional groove.</p>

<figcaption>Doo-Da&#8217;s.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The Doo-da’s — yep, that’s what Studio Morfar and Purpose Talent are calling them — are the gestural glue that holds this identity together. These animated cutout-style squiggles, inspired by Matisse and old jazz record sleeves (when was the last time you saw these two references mentioned in the same sentence?), pop up across the system with uninhibited enthusiasm. They swirl, bounce, and shimmy their way through layouts, adding rhythm and energy to everything they touch. In a visual system already rich with motion and character, the Doo-da’s add an extra layer of kinetic charm, reinforcing the brand’s methodology: fulfillment doesn’t always follow a straight line — sometimes it squiggles.</p>

<blockquote>
The copy, developed in collaboration with strategist and writer <a href="https://janhagen.xyz/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Victor Janhagan,</a> hums with musicality too: “Work to your own beat,” “Find your rhythm,” “People make businesses.” These are simple lines with big resonance, aligning with Purpose Talent’s mission to put people first and help them find their calling on their own terms.

<p>The best brand systems know when to strut and when to step back, and the Purpose Talent applications prove this identity knows its choreography. From business cards to billboards, everything feels intentional — not overly designed, but never phoned in. The layouts lean into the core assets (color, type, illustration, and Doo-da’s) with confidence and restraint, letting each element take a solo without overpowering the ensemble. That said, it’s evident that Con McHugh was contracted to produce a limited set of assets, and those get repurposed quite a bit throughout the system. While I respect the budgetary realities of working with an illustrator of his caliber, I’d love to see this brand’s 2.5 evolution with a broader library of illustrations at its disposal.</p>

<p>The copywriting does a solid job of paying off the visual tone. Lines like “Work to your own beat” and “Find your rhythm” feel well-aligned with the brand’s visual and conceptual foundation, anchoring the design with purpose (how many more times am I going to make the same pun?) and emotion. Paired with the expressive visuals, these touchpoints feel less like recruitment ads and more like little moments of encouragement.</p>

<p>This is the kind of brand you want to engage with — not because it shouts the loudest, but because it moves with style, clarity, and a sense of joyful humanity.</p>

<p>The website ties everything together in one smooth, scroll-happy experience. From the moment the page loads, you’re pulled into a rhythm that mirrors the brand itself — not stiff and corporate, but fluid, expressive, and human. With its kinetic typography, animated illustrations, and generous breathing room, the site feels like a welcome break from the templated sameness that dominates the recruiting and HR space. It’s not just a site you visit — it’s one you <em>vibe</em> with.</p>

<p>Even the swag brings the sauce. Tote bags, posters, t-shirts, hats — each one extends the identity without feeling like an afterthought. It’s a testament to how thoughtfully this system was built: expressive enough to dance across a billboard, yet grounded enough to look good on a baseball cap.</p>

<p>Purpose Talent’s rebrand is a breath of fresh (and funky) air in a category often stuck in neutral. It’s loose without being messy, polished without being stiff, and driven by an ethos that puts <em>people</em> — not just “talent” — front and center. Every element, from the illustrations to the Doo-da’s, moves with intention and emotion, inviting both clients and candidates to see themselves not just as cogs in a machine, but as essential parts of something greater.</p>

<p class="end">Sure, the lines may wiggle, the Doo-da’s may jiggle, and the characters may wobble — but the message stands tall: purposefully placed people <a href="https://flashbak.com/45-years-later-weebles-wobble-but-they-dont-fall-down-63318/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">don’t fall down</a>.</p>
