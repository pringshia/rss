The spot lists the types of balls in Boston — <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEi_ouTnprY" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“Old balls. New balls. Steel balls. Cold balls.”</a> — accompanied by images of professional male athletes, hinting not so subtly that there are too many men with balls in Boston and that now, a team with athletes sporting no balls, was the new attraction. The campaign provoked in the wrong way, with various trans athletes and members of the LGBTQ+ community calling it exclusionary and transphobic. Certainly not a good way to start but at least it drew attention away from the questionable team name.

                                            <p><strong>Relevant quote</strong><br /><em>Inspiration for the Sister logotype comes from several sources. The modulating line is inspired by diagrams found within the Manchester Code, a serial data signalling system developed in the late 1940s at The University of Manchester and first used in the Manchester Mark I computer. As well as referencing the code, it represents the porous edges of the site and the gently undulating River Medlock that runs beneath the buildings.<br /><br />The line also appears in the form of the Sister symbol, a linear version of the logotype and a shorthand expression of the visual identity. Designed to provide impact and recognition at small sizes across both print and digital applications, the symbol also informs the signage that appears across the site.<br /><br />Taking the letterforms found on early code-breaking machines and some of Turing’s first-generation computers as inspiration, the team created Sister Mono, a custom monospaced typeface in four weights and two optical sizes. Sister Mono’s distinctive character lends itself to being used in many different ways without losing any brand recognition or impact.

                                            <p><strong>Opinion</strong><br />
                                            The old logo was a little barebones but was nicely executed with a simple sans serif and a square offsetting the “ID” element in a matching thickness. The new logo is both simple and complex in the sense that there aren't that many elements to it — a monospace wordmark and a looping device — but at the same time it's like it has a lot going on and raises many questions. The first of which — and which is not the fault of the logo — being what does the name mean? It is actually a cool back-story: it comes from a 1963 report titled “The Robbins Report” from a Manchester committee on higher education that suggested the creation of three “Special Institutions for Scientific and Technological Education and Research”, aka S.I.S.T.E.R.s and London-based <a href="https://www.thedraftwriters.com/" target="_blank">The Draft</a> simplified it to Sister.<span></span> The second question is, why the loops? The explanation is a little less satisfying and you can read that in the quoted text. It's not that the concept isn't valid, relevant, or appropriate — it is all of those things — it's just simply not that exciting or easy to communicate but, at face value, the loops can be interpreted as offering connection and unity and how it threads together various new enterprises in one district.<span></span> The logo is typeset in the identity's custom type family, a very pleasing monospace that conveys a technical, vintage-computer-y aesthetic, which helps drive and unify the identity, which is a good thing because it feels like things go in one too many directions with the photography, messaging, and patterns and animations. To their credit, this is a reflection of the relative complexity of representing the district which is part innovation hub, part lifestyle destination so the imagery ranges from scientific to culinary to family-oriented and the website does do a good job in communicating the confluence of interests. Overall, not the clearest of identities in the sense that it's hard to tell who or what it's for but with some solid elements as its foundation that will most likely pay off when the district comes to life.</p>

<h1 class="friday_likes">7 Island Coffee by VIW Design</h1>
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/friday_likes_7island.jpg" alt="7 Island Coffee by VIW Design" />

<p style="margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;"><a href="https://www.instagram.com/7island_coffee/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">7 Island Coffee</a> is a café located in Gadeokdo, one of the many — five or six, apparently depending on who you ask — islands off the coast of Busan, South Korea&#8217;s second most populous city behind Seoul. <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C-7NSVqJjPB/?img_index=3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Designed by mttb</a>, the café is no ordinary establishment with a building that spans three floors and features seven interconnected, non-linear spaces with views of the various islands. The identity, designed by Seoul-based <a href="https://www.viw.design/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">VIW Design</a>, follows the angled construction of the building and its maze-like spaces with an irregular heptagon that looks like a rock and can shape-shift into a number (at least seven, natch) of compositions, all maintaining the hard angles that are also representative of the space. The shape can be used on its own or it can be populated with either the full name of the café set at jarring angles or with numbers 1 through 7 in a lovely serif, with each number occupying a corner of the shape, creating some really nice tension. Deployed in a simple black and white color palette, this is definitely not your strip mall Starbucks. <span class="pagination_divider"></span><span class="small_caps"><a href="https://www.behance.net/gallery/199745007/Seven-Island-Coffee-Brand-Experience-Design" target="_blank" rel="noopener">See full project</a></span></p>

<h1 class="friday_likes">Garoo by Long &amp; Short</h1>
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/friday_likes_garoo.jpg" alt="Garoo by Long &amp; Short" />

<p style="margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;"><a href="https://www.instagram.com/bakery_garoo_2nd/?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Garoo</a> is a bakery that offers bread and pastries in the Gangwon Province of South Korea, known as the country&#8217;s largest and least densely populated subdivision (as well as being the host of the 2018 Winter Olympics and 2018 Winter Paralympics). The identity, designed by Seoul-based <a href="https://www.longandshort.co.kr/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Long &amp; Short</a>, introduces a charming unicase wordmark that features tilted “O”s and a funky single-storey “a”, which probably needed just a little bit of additional modulation to make its stem be less thick as it does stand apart from the rest of the letters. Nonetheless, it&#8217;s a very unexpected design and it is nicely deployed across the applications in generous sizes. A supporting element is a composition of tiny, spaced-out letters that spell out “Happiness made small” and then it also says “Heart”, which is odd but probably just a lost-in-translation deal. What I do know is that that croissant would make me very happy. <span class="pagination_divider"></span><span class="small_caps"><a href="https://www.longandshort.co.kr/84" target="_blank" rel="noopener">See full project</a></span>

<h1 class="friday_likes">Bao Makers by Darling Visual Communications</h1>
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/friday_likes_baomakers.jpg" alt="Bao Makers by Darling Visual Communications" />

<p style="margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:30px!important;"><a href="https://www.baomakers.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bao Makers</a>, as its name implies, makes baos in Singapore but not just any baos… it offers eclectic baos like chili crab, salted egg chicken, chipotle beef, and truffle mushroom along with more traditional options. The identity, designed by local firm <a href="https://www.darling.sg/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Darling Visual Communications</a>, revolves, almost literally, around a bulbous checkered pattern that is meant to be “reminiscent of dough being stretched and kneaded” and although that is the last thing I would have thought of to be honest it does clearly signal that this isn&#8217;t a traditional bao establishment. Paired with a thin sans serif in varying widths and plenty of white space, the identity feels more 1990s rave than 2020s culinary experience but it&#8217;s definitely cool to look at and, really, for all I care, you could put those baos in a box with Comic Sans on them and I wouldn&#8217;t mind one bit.  <span class="pagination_divider"></span><span class="small_caps"><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C-uXFq2S2mS/?img_index=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">See full project</a></span></p>

I received this tip two weeks ago and I&#8217;m surprised that the Ogilvyland website is still up and running and has not been taken down by the media giant so go experience all the excitement you can find at this faux amusement park before it&#8217;s torn down.

Since its founding in 1964 by Dr. Amar Bose, the company has been dedicated to delivering amazing sound experiences through innovation.

For 60 years, this belief has driven us to create products that have become iconic, changing the way people listen to music.&#8221;</p>

They also needed to build on their legacy of relentless innovation that had turned them into an iconic global brand. Bose invited us to help create a new way forward.<br /><br />Working closely with the in-house leadership at Bose, we transformed the global brand’s voice and expression to better carry this story. In doing so, we signaled Bose’s evolution to this higher-order, more desirable value: “Immersive Audio.”<br /><br />We amplified and freed up their identity to take on its most expansive form – aiming to reassert Bose with a revitalized, declarative voice that invites people into an unparalleled world of immersive sound.

                                            <p><strong>Opinion</strong><br />
                                            <strong>UPDATE:</strong> Due to some miscommunication, there was no logo update in this project. The logo, as it appears in this identity, has been around for a number of years so all references to that change (which didn't change) have been removed from this post. Apologies for any confusion.<span></span> The hero of this identity is the new custom type family designed by <a href="https://store.tekio.work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tekio</a> as an extension of the logo, with vertiginous slanted and back-slanted variations in both upper and lowercase, for a pretty amazing display typeface that stacks so satisfyingly. A less bombastic style in a condensed structure is also quite good for more regular use. The motion behavior of the typography is pretty slick, although perhaps a little too race-car-y, a feeling that is accentuated by the various backgrounds of blurry, parallel lines going in different directions. These are definitely groovy but it's hard not to think of that old trick in Photoshop of grabbing a one-pixel-line and extending it.<span></span> Not a whole lot in application and, sadly, no sound to accompany the motion samples — although you can get a taste <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Bose/videos" target="_blank">in Bose's YouTube page</a> — so it's hard to see how this plays out beyond that one ad above, which, granted, is pretty cool and that red tunnel with the thin light-filled lines zig-zagging shows the newfound flexibility of the logo's extendable lines. Overall, plenty of potential in the new design language and art direction that confidently confirm Bose's leadership position in its market.</p>

The new brand has been co-founded by Tom Holland (<a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm4043618/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">of Tom Holland fame</a>) and John Herman (who is not as famous but has been quite successful in leading CPG brands) along with consumer-led fund <a href="https://www.imaginary.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Imaginary Ventures</a> and talent agency <a href="https://www.wmeagency.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WME</a>. Inspired by Tom&#8217;s sobriety journey — two years and counting — BERO will launch with three varieties: Kingston Golden Pils, named after his hometown of Kingston Upon Thames; Edge Hill Hazy IPA, named for the street address of his childhood school, Donhead Preparatory; and Noon Wheat, named after his beloved schnauzer. Available nationwide, BERO will also roll out across Target stores next year. The identity and packaging have been designed by Brooklyn, NY-based <a href="center.design/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CENTER</a>.</p>

<figcaption>Logo with fish.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The new logo is a simple, classy flared serif with just the right amount of elegance and sophistication before reaching pretentious territory. Typeset in Dinamo&#8217;s <a href="https://abcdinamo.com/typefaces/arizona" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Arizona Flare</a> I do question the flare-less leg of the “R” as it feels too stiff compared to the rest of the features of the rest of the letters and could have probably used some additional customization. At this point it&#8217;s also worth raising the issue that I have no idea how this name is pronounced… it could be B-eer-oh as in “beer” or B-ehr-oh like a bear in the woods. Not that it matters visually but I do feel like the pronunciation would help further define the level of sophistication. B-eer-oh would be kind of cheesy and weird while B-ehr-oh would be more elegant. Nonetheless, it&#8217;s a nice wordmark.</p>

<p>The logo is complemented by a fish that I had to ask about its provenance because there was no obvious answer I could find anywhere. The answer is that the fish, and its accompanying filigree, come from <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Coat_of_Arms_of_the_Royal_Borough_of_Kingston_upon_Thames.svg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the coat of arms of the Royal Borough of Kingston Upon Thames</a>, Tom&#8217;s hometown. It&#8217;s a pretty nice fish drawing and the abstraction of the filigree is very nicely executed. Both elements, in a single color, pair beautifully with the wordmark.</p>

<p>Also toeing a fine line between too elegant and just-the-right-amount of elegant is a series of typographic compositions mixing a sans serif with a more formal, wedding-invitation-like script that make for a great pairing thanks to the excellent typesetting and balance of uppercase and sentence case along with the single, muted color approach.</p>

<p>The packaging is relatively straightforward, with a minimal amount of elements deployed on a centered arrangement but everything is very nicely balanced and the split of gold on top with the three different colors on the bottom look great as a family. I wonder if the names of the beers would have been better served by using Arizona Flare instead of the somewhat dry sans serif used and while we are questioning things, perhaps the logo in black is a little too harsh… would have loved to see a deep, dark brown. Nonetheless, the cans look really, really good and the gold-on-gold fish is a lovely detail.</p>

<p>The cases shift the tone a little bit with a bolder look and I really dig how the gold can is used against the color backgrounds with the logo and typography laying on top of both. The shipping boxes might steal the show, though, with the messaging on the side and the big brand assets on the front.</p>

<p>The lifestyle imagery and footage gets a little preppy for my taste and starts to feel like you need a healthy trust fund in your name to be able to enjoy this beverage. Like… it&#8217;s a little too aspirational and slowly starts to creep into the more pretentious territory that the design was able to tiptoe around. It&#8217;s also an interesting contrast to another celebrity-backed non-alcoholic beer: Dax Shepard&#8217;s <a href="https://www.instagram.com/tedsegersbrew" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ted Segers</a>, which has a much more grounded and everyday-dude persona. Obviously, there is room in the market for both to find their respective audiences — I just know <a href="https://m.imdb.com/title/tt0387808/mediaviewer/rm2240773376/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">who</a> I would rather have a drink with personally.</p>

<p class="end">Overall, this is a perfect match in design and tone for Tom Holland and it properly elevates the presence of this non-alcoholic beer as something more covetable and socially more inspiring than the well-known O’Douls <a href="https://proofnomore.com/collections/non-alcoholic-beers?srsltid=AfmBOopqJPQ64zJmPP7IF_ZrK0_YrHlXRpaqcXNjcc2zlMOk2Jg3JsKl" target="_blank" rel="noopener">or the bevy of craft N-As in the market</a> that lack a clear direction or audience.</p>
