Perrone, a lawyer in East Lansing, MI, and owner of <a href="https://dragonlawyerspc.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dragon Lawyers PC</a> recently drew the ire of a federal judge who recoiled at the use of this bad-ass dragon drawing (sans speech bubble) — that Perrone purchased for $20 online — as a large watermark on every single page of a lawsuit he had filed on behalf of a client. The judge called the use of the dragon “not only distracting,” but also “juvenile and impertinent” and demanded that a new filing be made without it. Party pooper.

                                            <p><strong>Relevant quote</strong><br /><em>SOUNDBOKS launches a brand refresh to mark the start of a new era. Alongside its modernized look and feel, the refresh signals SOUNDBOKS’ shift in ambition towards becoming a lifestyle brand resonating with fashion and music communities and subcultures.<br /><br />The <em>Own The Party</em> campaign is the first chance to see the rebrand in action. At its core, the campaign empowers music lovers, creators, party-starters, and community builders to create their own culture. Alongside this message, the campaign captures the essence of the SOUNDBOKS experience. <em>Own The Party</em> tells the story of the brand’s community, showing how these communities like to get down and use their speakers to create lifelong memories on their terms.

                                            <p><strong>Opinion</strong><br />
                                            The logo evolution is subtle and depending on how italic you like your italics it will be a step forward or a step backward. Without feeling too passionate about it, I do favor the new, less slanted version as it feels stronger and more balanced and less like an athletic apparel brand. I would have personally removed the little spikes in the “N” that I am not sure why they were there in the first place but I guess they are important because the new identity pretty much revolves around that small design detail.<span></span> Slicing the stem of the “N” off, the driving graphic ends up looking like a “1”, which is somewhat confusing as there is no “1” in the name and its visual link to the wordmark is very tenuous once it's extracted from it. The conflicting part of this is that the graphic looks cool as a pattern and animated so it's hard to be too mad about it. I would love to see more of the behavior happening in the “Sound You Can Feel” promo where the pattern shifts and grows to reveal different imagery within it.<span></span> The extended sans serif, <a href="https://power-type.com/base-neue" target="_blank">Base Neue</a>, is a hip and youthful choice and a good contrast to the condensed logo. The ink traps do get a little tiring but maybe that's just the preponderance of ink traps over the years on Brand New and for the young revelers in the “Own the Party” campaign it's just a <em>rad</em> typeface. The emphasis on “rad” is on purpose as it clearly points out how far removed I am from the target audience of the campaign and henceforth the Soundboks brand in general — my ears hurt and my feet are tired just from looking at it. Overall, this is a fun, electric, youthful identity that definitely makes Soundboks look and sound like the life of the party.</p>

Offering multiple financial services for individuals as well as businesses, Banamex counts with approximately 20 million clients served by more than 39,000 employees across 1,300 branches and with more than 9,000 ATMs. In 2001 Citigroup Inc. acquired Banamex, changing the consumer-facing brand to Citibanamex in 2016 — <a href="https://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/new_name_and_logo_for_citibanamex.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a move we covered on Brand New</a> — and now things are reverting to &#8220;normal&#8221; as Citi announced the separation of its institutional banking business in Mexico from its consumer, SME, and middle market businesses, establishing two separate financial groups in Mexico: Grupo Financiero Citi México and Grupo Financiero Banamex. While the former will service institutional clients, the latter will focus on retail clients, leading to the reintroduction of the Banamex name and brand, with anew identity designed by <a href="https://interbrand.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Interbrand</a>.</p>

<figcaption>Icon in 3D as graphic.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The old logo was both a mouthful and an eyeful with two brand names and two iconic-on-their-own logos affixed together. To their credit, the name, other than being super long, was not terrible and, from my own personal but limited experience, people in Mexico did start referring to it by its full Citibanamex name despite decades of being known as Banamex. Even on my annual trips to Mexico I had grown accustomed to the Citi gradient and red and blue color combo replacing the once-iconic brown the bank was known for. However, I&#8217;m not sad at all to see the Citi look leaving Banamex and the return of the “Roseta” (Rosette) icon to its rightful place as the primary graphic device for Banamex (as opposed to the previous appendage status it had) is most welcome.</p>

<p>The icon, originally drawn as five abstract “b”s rotating in a circle to reveal a star in the center and allude to Prehispanic graphic motifs, has been slightly redrawn to have a slightly sharper and less blobby presence with each “petal” in the icon now having a more squared-off and symmetric silhouette and making the counterspaces a little more defined. The new construction also allows for the separation of each petal, which pays off in the slick logo animation where the icon spins into its final composition with a subtle 3D construction. This then allows the icon to be used as a big, bold graphic in 3D, which is quite nicely executed and literally and figuratively adds a new dimension to the icon, infusing it with a fresh energy after almost ten years of playing second fiddle to the Citi logo.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not as enthused about the new wordmark. It&#8217;s fine for the most part but there is something wonky-slash-wobbly about it… like, the top-right corners of the “a”s, “n”, and “m” look like the letters are leaning back. I can see they were trying to echo the construction of the petals but there is also a slight dissonance between the inner curves and the outer curves that don&#8217;t flow so well. Still, it&#8217;s a modern-looking wordmark.</p>  

<blockquote>Key design elements included an expanded color palette, a versatile graphic system, a custom typeface, and a photography style that authentically captures the essence of Mexico. The brand was also adapted for digital environments with motion elements and a revitalized sonic identity that reinterprets the classic Leonora Banamex melody.</blockquote><h3><a href="https://interbrand.com/work/banamex/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Interbrand project page</a></h3>

<p>While the wordmark isn&#8217;t as effective when isolated, the custom type family that extends the wordmark&#8217;s design language is much more successful in smaller sizes and in higher doses, where the quirks that stand out when too much focus is placed on them actually render a rather nice texture as headlines and subheadlines in the applications shown in this post but more so in Banamex&#8217;s website. Another strong identity element is the color palette, with the coral red from the icon leading the way, along with the dark teal. It&#8217;s an elegant yet vibrant main combination. The individual petals from the icon also yield the primary graphic device for the identity, which is a series of interlocking rounded-corner compositions. They provide a nice structure to the layouts and plenty of flexibility of what goes into the shapes — be it photography, messaging, or just plain color backgrounds — and how they come together.</p>

<p>Not a whole lot to see in application, but there is some nice variety to the system and one thing that may be getting lost in translation is the tone of voice, which is actually quite good for a bank… aspirational yet not cloying. My favorite bit is the wall advertising that, loosely, reads as “We are what we believe. And we believe in you.” Like, you actually believe them they are out there looking for you as a customer. Throughout the website and applications other bits of copywriting are quite good. The one thing where it starts to get a little odd is in the Instagram posts above where the modular graphics go 3D and maybe it&#8217;s one design trick too many.</p>

<p class="end">Overall, this is a very successful identity that sheds all Citi design traits and adopts a unique visual language and tone of voice all of its own that makes it look as if the Citibanamex era was just a figment of our imagination that never happened and this recent redesign was simply a straight evolution of the Banamex we once knew.</p>

Designed by independent designer <a href="https://www.hellokbd.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kim Berlin</a>, this was a fairly big job for her — small or not, designing an airline is on many designers&#8217; bucket lists — and, presumably, an excellent portfolio piece for business development purposes. That changed for her recently, as Avelo signed an agreement with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s Immigration Control and Enforcement (the infamous ICE) agency to fly federal deportation flights from Arizona. To some this is not the best association to have anything to do with, leading Berlin to wrestle with what to do and how to feel about this brand she helped build that five years later could actually hurt her business. Fast Company has the full story at the link and some of Berlin&#8217;s additional thoughts on the matter can be found <a href="https://iamkimberlin.substack.com/p/purple-pain?utm_campaign=post&#038;utm_medium=web&#038;triedRedirect=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.

No bleach, no harsh chemicals, no need. Just super soft, sustainable, affordable loo roll, made from recycled cardboard or bamboo. We never thought about toilet paper &#8211; until one day, we did. Why is it white? Who decided that? And why add bleach and chemicals just to flush it away? So we made a better alternative. Unbleached, simple, and a whole lot kinder to the planet. Because toilet paper doesn’t need to be white. But it does need to be better. We wanted every part of our paper to be carefully considered. So, from our fossil fuel free factory to the eco-friendly ink on our boxes, every choice is deliberate. No bleach. No plastic. No shortcuts. Just smarter, greener decisions that add up to something much bigger.&#8221;</p>

                                            <p><strong>Relevant quote</strong><br /><em>Otherway repositioned, renamed and rebranded the company, moving from Naked Sprout to Naked Paper. At the core of the strategy is a simple but powerful idea: It’s brown because it’s greener.<br /><br />The new identity embraces the raw honesty of the product. A flowing wordmark, inspired by the gentle curve of paper, speaks to softness and simplicity. The NP icon evokes the side profile of a toilet roll, another quiet reminder of what the brand stands for.<br /><br />A stripped-back, unbleached brand world underpins every touchpoint, from the packaging to the launch campaign. Even the box was rethought to serve a second life in the bathroom, flipping open into functional storage.

                                            <p><strong>Opinion</strong><br />
                                            With the old name and logo, never, in a million years, I would have deducted that this was a toilet paper brand and “sprout” was the last word I would want associated with anything that goes near my bumhole. To their credit, the name was chosen as a nod to the bamboo material used in their paper but, even then, “sprout” isn't the first association that comes to mind with bamboo and the logo, aside from being light and friendly with its rounded sans serif, provided no further references to bamboo nor any indication of what the product was. The new name seems so obvious and is probably why they avoided it in the first place but its simplicity and directness proves that sometimes trying to be clever or memorable gets in the way of being effective.<span></span> The new logo is fantastic, with all of its rounded letterforms looking like rolls of toilet paper seen from the side as all off the round counterspaces look like the cardboard tubes that hold the rolls in place. The monospace approach afforded by the new name and the graphic serendipity that the “A”s and the “E”s are in the same position in each word is so extremely satisfying, yielding an excellent rhythm and density to the logo. It's a simple idea, executed perfectly. The monogram is also a clever take on the idea of a roll of paper unspooling but the resulting graphic is a little too droopy and the “P” shape ends up looking a little awkward. Still, a commendable effort to stick to the concept of visualizing toilet paper.<span></span>The identity celebrates the brown-ness of the product with a core color palette of brown and tan with a rusted salmon-y color as an accent and the typography sticks to the stemless approach of the logo with the use of <a href="https://extraset.ch/typefaces/build/" target="_blank">ES Build</a>. It's a simple set of elements that aside from being relevant to the product are visually pleasant and, the color palette especially, sidestep most DTC trends. The packaging sticks to a single brown color on brown boxes with brown paper inside and, no surprise, it works. The lifestyle photography perhaps takes things a little too far with the brown hues as, at times, finding the product in all those brown settings is like trying to find Waldo. I exaggerate of course but the sentiment is that perhaps a contrasting approach would be to offset the product against, perhaps, an all-white kitchen counter or bathroom.<span></span> The couple of hero headlines — “It's brown because it's greener.” and “We didn't make it brown. Nature did.” — are so good in their ability to get to the point. Overall, this is an excellent update turning what most people would consider a turn-off — if you've ever wiped your butt with brown paper or tried to dry your hands with no less than 100 sheets of brown paper towels you know what I'm talking about — into the product's best selling point and does so with a frugal yet playful design.</p>

                                            <p>Founded in 2011 in Latvia, <a href="https://woolyorganic.com/en/" target="blank" rel="noopener">Wooly Organic</a> is a manufacturer of children’s clothing and toys made of &#8220;<a href="https://woolyorganic.com/en/about-us/" target="blank" rel="noopener">only the finest organic, regenerative, recycled, or biodegradable fabrics</a>.&#8221; All their products are designed and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DH74xtbCNIH/" target="blank" rel="noopener">produced in Latvia</a>. They sell directly from their website and through other retailers across the EU. It&#8217;s the kind of company you want to see succeed – started by a mum, making useful products, creating local jobs, not killing the planet. They are in the process of rolling out a new logo and identity designed by London, UK- and Riga, Latvia-based <a href="https://www.gramatica.studio" target="blank" rel="noopener">Gramática</a>.</p>

<blockquote>Wooly Organic has become a trusted name for parents who prioritise quality, comfort, and sustainability. Expanding beyond Latvia, the brand now brings its eco-friendly, thoughtfully designed products to families across Europe. As it continues to grow, Wooly Organic remains dedicated to create clothing that is both beautiful and gentle on the planet for future generations.<br><br>The new identity reflects the brand’s growth and maturity while preserving the warmth and playfulness of childhood, embodying its core values of functionality and timeless design.<br><br>A clean, simplified layout, distinctive typography, and a colour palette inspired by the brand’s products create a structured design system that purposefully highlights the product, clothing patterns, or lifestyle imagery as the focal point.</blockquote>

<p>Wooly Organic sits squarely in the <a href="https://vm.tiktok.com/ZNd2fLR8m/">Werner-Herzog’s-sad-beige-clothes-for-sad-beige-children</a> space. That’s not an insult. I laugh at the link. I also love the clothes. If I had spare money and young children, they would be head-to-toe Wooly Organic.</p>

<p>I don’t know the behind-the-scenes story of Wooly Organic’s origins. I’m guessing there was a lot of bootstrapping and DIYing and that the logo was made by the founder or a friend’s cousin who “makes the cutest things on their computer”. (&#8220;I used  roundy letters in &#8216;wooly&#8217; to show you&#8217;re friendly and squarey letters in &#8216;organic&#8217; to show you&#8217;re serious about sustainability. It&#8217;s subtle yet powerful.&#8221; —the friend&#8217;s cousin, probably.) The ears reference many of the products. There was thought put into it, I&#8217;m sure, and it was good enough for getting a good business off the ground. But it’s nowhere near good enough for an aspiring Europe-wide brand, so it’s sensibly being ditched.</p>

    <figcaption>Wordmark, not stacked.</figcaption>
    </figure>

<p>The new wordmark is neither wooly nor organic. It takes Lineto’s excellent version of Futura, <a href="https://lineto.com/typefaces/supreme#family">LL Supreme</a>, as a starting place, borrows ideas from other geometric typefaces and ends up as almost completely custom lettering. In the stacked version, further optical adjustments ensure it all looks right. I love the line spacing. The overlap of the descender of the &#8220;y&#8221; and the tittle of the &#8220;i&#8221; is perfect.(Note: In an earlier version of this post I wrote that the wordmark was stock LL Supreme. Thank you to John McHugh for pointing out my mistake in the comments and Toms from Gramática for telling me how the wordmark was actually designed.)</p>

<p>One one hand, the shapes of the letters are simple and childlike. On the other hand: <a href="https://www.vitra.com">Vitra</a> and modernism with the faintest undertones of <a href="https://uk.supreme.com/pages/shop">Supreme</a> and <a href="https://www.moma.org/artists/3266-barbara-kruger">Kruger</a>. This brand, held by both those hands, is, I think, perfectly calculated to connect with the parents who will buy these clothes.</p>

<p>The vibe, pre-update, was cozy, beige and cute.</p>

    </figure>

<p>The new, updated vibe hangs onto the beige and cute but loses some of the coziness with the addition of lots more raw cardboard (because eco) and little kids styled to look perfectly unstyled in empty, neutral spaces. Here’s how they do it:</p>

<p>The warm chocolate brown and beige combination is a winner. I’m perfectly fine with the fact that the secondary colours never show up except on the website mockup below.</p>

<p>The type is all LL Supreme, just like the workmark, but regular instead of bold. Letters in circles and squares for emphasising important words is a nice touch and the closest this brand gets to edgy or surprising.</p>

<p>If Wooly Organic was a purely digital company, these branding choices would be too sharp and too cold. But when the brand elements are applied to physical materials, they feel different, friendlier. The brand graphics work because of the products and packaging they are applied to.</p>

<p>All these applications feel right. But as you&#8217;ll see below, without textures to interact with, the brand approaches but doesn’t quite slip into sterility. Kids are adorable and the clothes are lovely. And that saves it.</p>

<p>The actual website uses Poppins. It’s a small company. Maybe the rebrand budget didn’t stretch to a webfont licence for LL Supreme.</p>

<p>Compare the above phone mockup with the one below. Notice how much more appealing the phone on textured fabric is. Texture makes this brand.</p>

<p>That’s it.</p>

<p>This is the slenderest of brands: some type, a circle, a square, two colours. It could have been more. Maybe it will evolve to be more in time. But for now it’s enough to succeed, for four reasons.</p>

<p> 1. It&#8217;s conservative but it doesn&#8217;t make any mistakes.</p>

<p> 2. It&#8217;s usable. As long as Wooly Organic keep making cute clothes and photographing them on cute kids, they will have no trouble making themselves look good. There&#8217;s not a lot to mess up.</p>

<p> 3. It&#8217;s applied to real products. I hope Gramática and Wooly Organic see that the tactile, physical parts of this rebrand are where it really works and they lean into it, with <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DIJOtpYip_Q/" target="blank" rel="noopener">intensity and determination</a>.</p>

<p class="end">4. I think Gramática have been smart with the positioning. This brand isn’t clever or fun or vibrant, but it does clearly say, <em>Hey, Europe, Wooly Organic is the safe choice for parents who (aspire to) buy their furniture from Vitra.</em> That seems like a good niche to be in.</p>
