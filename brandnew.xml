                                            <p>Amazon has introduced a new private label brand called <a href="https://press.aboutamazon.com/2024/9/amazon-fresh-introduces-new-grocery-savings-for-prime-members" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amazon Saver</a>. Complementing the company’s selection of other private-label brands, Amazon Saver will offer kitchen and pantry staples ranging from “crackers and cookies to canned fruit and condiments”, all priced under $5. The red-and-white color palette and simplicity are kind of cool, tbh. This new packaging also shows a new identity that Amazon has been rolling out haphazardly over the past few months. (Yes, I have received all of your tips — thank you! — and I have some insider knowledge of who designed it but neither them nor the client have released it formally so my lips are sealed for now.)

Her creations are mainly to be viewed on a stage or a catwalk. The main aim of her designs is to create an impact on the viewer and evoke feelings. The costumes are not for everyday use. Each costume has been created as a one off, the techniques used to create them were developed by her, by experimenting with textiles, fabric, and paint. She owns all the design rights. Each costume requires special care and each is cleaned separately from everything else according to the label. In most cases Konieczka will re-invent the purchased fabrics by processing or dyeing them, and she never uses fabric straight from the shop. The main motifs in her designs are asymmetry, destruction, dramatics, and the macabre. All costumes are handmade.&#8221;</p>

                                            <p><strong>Relevant quote</strong><br /><em>The concept of the logo was based on the motif of a crown of thorns, reflecting the fact that Katarzyna Konieczka is the undisputed queen among polish costume designers. Additionally, her works often feature sharp elements that can be associated with thorns. In addition to the main sign, we also designed a logo with a postscript extension, as well as a shortened version featuring an abbreviated emblem based on the designer's initials, KK.

                                            <p><strong>Opinion</strong><br />
                                            With a logo like this I would normally say that “If I didn't know what it said I wouldn't be able to read it” but, in this case, I <em>know</em> what is says — Konieczka — and I still can not read it but gosh darn it I love it. I love the 3D liquid metal texture, I love the barbed wire look, and I love the underlying letterforms from which the thorns emanate — you have to squint real hard to see them but they are there. I would actually love to see a flat, thorn-less version be part of the identity. While readability is zero, recognizability is 100 as nothing else out there looks like this, not even Death Metal logos, which would be the closest comparison as this has a sophistication to it that those don't have. The mirrored “K” shorthand logo is pretty cool too and I like that it almost looks like a mask, echoing <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10101812767002251&amp;set=t.100044136684395&amp;type=3" target="_blank">some of Konieczka's designs</a>.<span></span> While the identity could have been all chaos and weird and unhinged, I appreciate that they established some ground rules and layout approaches to give the weirdness an actual system, so the logo can be used in repetition as a border device on top of imagery or a simple criss-crossed thin line frame can be used to house information or a crime-scene tape motif can be employed for added drama. The headline typeface, <a href="https://www.futurefonts.xyz/cstm/cstm-xprmntl-02" target="_blank">CSTM Xprmntl 02</a>, is wild and has a luxurious and decadent feel to it that complements both the logo and Konieczka's pieces. The supporting sans serif is a little too tame and doesn't quite jive with the rest of the elements and I'm also not the biggest fan of the super hard flash photography as it feels too trendy and it's something that non-edgy brands use to come across as edgy and if anything is edgy is Konieczka's work. Overall, this is bad-ass and so appropriate for the aesthetic and work of the designer it represents.</p>

                                            <p>Dating back to 1823 when it was founded as the Brooklyn Apprentices&#8217; Library, the <a href="https://www.brooklynmuseum.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Brooklyn Museum</a> is one of the oldest and largest art museums in the United States. Located in Brooklyn, NY, and housed since 1895 in an impressive 560,000-square-foot Beaux-Arts building, the museum is home to an art collection with roughly 1.5 million works that ranges from ancient Egyptian masterpieces to contemporary art, and represent a wide range of cultures, including  European, African, Oceanic, Japanese, and American art. The eclectic collection of antiquities paired with temporary exhibits of contemporary art, is a great reflection of the actual building, with its classic architecture in the background <a href="https://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/brooklyn_museum_2024_facade_details_03.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fronted by a spaceship-like entrance</a>. As it celebrates its 200th anniversary, the Brooklyn Museum has introduced a new identity designed by local firm <a href="https://www.othermeans.us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Other Means</a>.</p>
<span id="more-297907"></span>

<blockquote>The new visual language reflects and celebrates the past while bringing us boldly into the future. As part of their research, our creative team took a deep dive into our archives, and the Museum’s 200 years of graphic design history became a rich source of inspiration.<br /><br />Our architectural design history also served as a wellspring of ideas. The Museum’s original neoclassical design, derived from ancient Greek and Roman architecture, was developed in the late 19th century by prominent New York architects McKim, Mead &#038; White. The architecture itself represents an evolution: from the building’s traditional design to moves toward modernist architecture in the 1930s, to recent projects that have created more open and welcoming spaces.<br /><br />The new brand draws on these elements from our past and unites them with our identity as a contemporary institution. This is accomplished through an approachable, modern sans serif typeface and ligatures that express our multidimensionality—especially within our new logo.<br /><br />Two dots, inspired by those that frame the names of ancient philosophers, playwrights, and poets across the building’s facade, now bookend the logo and text throughout the Museum. This reference to writers and thinkers links to our beginnings as a library and to the intersectional nature of the arts.<br /><br />In every application, the dots appear at least twice—an echo of the two O’s in Brooklyn. They can be activated in motion graphics, used as bullets in text or as functional features in signs, and occasionally replaced with symbols or illustrations to add meaning or a sense of play. In addition, we now intertwine the double O’s in Brooklyn and merge the M’s and U’s in Museum.</blockquote><h3><a href="https://www.brooklynmuseum.org/stories/new-brand" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Brooklyn Museum blog post</a></h3>

<p>The old logo wasn&#8217;t much to look at. I mean, it was fine, with its <a href="https://www.myfonts.com/collections/franklin-gothic-font-urw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Franklin Gothic</a>-esque wordmark and while I (sadly) haven&#8217;t visited the museum in decades, it seems they have also abandoned the funky “B” treatments <a href="https://2x4.org/work/brooklyn-museum/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">designed by 2&#215;4</a> in the early 2000s so it was just left with a wordmark that looked like type, out of the box. The new logo maintains the overall no-nonsense and Brooklyn-being-too-cool-for-school tone of the old one with a deadpan sans serif but with the twist of some unexpected ligatures between the “M”s and the ”U”s and an overlapped “OO” pair. It reminds me in spirit, not design, of the <a href="https://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/stedelijk_museum_amsterdam.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Stedelijk Museum Amsterdam</a> logo and identity by Mevis &amp; Van Deursen, where there was a bit of visual discomfort on purpose and a sparsity of flair or decoration. To a degree it also reminds me of <a href="http://www.designishistory.com/1960/fact-eros--avant-garde/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Herb Lubalin&#8217;s Avant Garde ligatures</a> and some of its gestures also appear in a few other examples of typography as you&#8217;ll see in the rest of the post.</p>

<p>Personal and loose associations aside, the new logo&#8217;s main and most visible design feature is the addition of two big circles to the side. My first interpretation was that they were meant to highlight, echo, complement, support, cheer the overlapped “O”s in “BROOKLYN”, which seemed a little redundant so I assumed there was another meaning or concept behind them. After parsing through more than 200 words in the design quote higher above that say a whole lot of nothing* in there there is a reference to the building&#8217;s facade which has inscribed on it the names of various philosophers, playwrights, and poets, each flanked by two large dots. You can see some crude samples of it from these Google Maps screenshots: <a href="https://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/brooklyn_museum_2024_facade_details_01.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A</a>, <a href="https://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/brooklyn_museum_2024_facade_details_02.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">B</a>.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s a valid but very subtle detail to pull from that I&#8217;m not sure how many people will recognize — not that they have to but with the dots being so prominent I do think there should be a more evident answer and reason to their existence. Despite my apprehension to the dots&#8217; origins, I actually do like the logo… it&#8217;s minimalist but quirky and the execution is quite good. The overlapped “O”s create a very cool glyph and the “MU” and “UM” ligatures almost pass unperceived, which I mean as a compliment because, as weird as they are, they are not distracting. Overall, the resulting design has a deadpan hipness to it that is very much at home in Brooklyn and it signals that this museum isn&#8217;t your typical museum.</p>

<p>* Sorry to be a little catty with that comment but as someone that reads design explanations and press releases for a living, it&#8217;s been a while since I rolled my eyes so hard at a description that says so much without actually managing to say something of value.</p>

<blockquote>Three gray values in the new brand similarly pay homage to our limestone building. But you’ll likely notice the other hues. We’ve embraced a brighter, more saturated version of a standard color wheel—a full palette with a distinctly Brooklyn vibe.<br /><br />The two dots, overlapping letters, and kaleidoscopic colors all convey the Museum’s identity as more than a single location, a single point in space, or a single perspective. We are a place where a multiplicity of ideas, identities, and points of origin converge. The design elements nod to the awesome array of artworks within our collection, as well as the many interconnected roles we are proud to play for our multifaceted public: art museum, educational center, forum for ideas, and weekend hotspot, to name a few.</blockquote><h3><a href="https://www.brooklynmuseum.org/stories/new-brand" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Brooklyn Museum blog post</a></h3>

<p>There isn&#8217;t much to the identity at the moment <a href="https://shop.brooklynmuseum.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">other than an onslaught of merch</a> that simply repeats the logo in as many surfaces as possible in a variety of color combinations that, for the time being, seem random and don&#8217;t help establish any kind of recognizable color palette for the institution. There is a mention of a trio of grays inspired by the building&#8217;s limestone color but, for now, it&#8217;s hard to tell what they are or where they appear. The yellow accent color so far is the most prominent and recognizable and it&#8217;s kind of cool. Back to the merch… it all looks quite good, especially the mugs and the key rings with the holes for the rings cleverly placed in the same place as the dots in the logo. Some of the t-shirts and hoodies display the museum&#8217;s address and feature additional Avant Garde-ish ligatures, which do look pretty nice. And how nice is it that the address is “200” so they can also overlap those two zeros?</p>

<p>As the only non-merch, non-apparel identity sample, the wild postings above are sort of interesting but also kind of confusing as there is no hierarchy or any clear sense of what&#8217;s being promoted and the copywriting is a little cringy. The 200th anniversary logo seen here (<a href="https://www.brooklynmuseum.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">and on the museum&#8217;s website</a>) is a little forced but it&#8217;s not as bad <a href="https://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/new_identity_for_lollapalooza_by_someoddpilot.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">as the 20th anniversary Lollapalooza logo</a>. It should also be noted that the website hasn&#8217;t yet been redesigned (and maybe it won&#8217;t be) to more specifically match the new logo and typography.</p>

<p class="end">It&#8217;s difficult to fully judge this identity as there are no examples of what the system is composed of, how it comes together, or samples beyond the merch and banners so it remains to be seen how this actually manifests in other instances, which I am guessing will be good given the initial display of hip-looking merch. Overall, for lack of a more erudite conclusion, this feels very Brooklyn-y.</p>

Unfortunately, their brand was being slept on. They needed a refresh that was both enthusiastic and simple, highlighting Sleep Origin's ability to help even the most difficult babies sleep through the night.<br /><br />We started with their logo, creating a swaddled baby icon that could toggle into sleep mode. From there, we continued with a night-inspired colour palette, toggle-style business cards, and sleeping baby door tags, showing how a rebrand can wake up even the snooziest of brand experiences.

                                            <p><strong>Opinion</strong><br />
                                            The old logo was a little amateurish in execution and straightforward in its concept with a baby head emanating some “Z”s but it was relatively fine if overly cutesy. The new logo introduces an icon that is such a fantastic combination of unexpected concepts: a swaddled baby and a power toggle button. So clever and original. Having tried myself with my two babies to swaddle them to turn them off and failing at it far many more times than succeeding, the icon speaks to 30-year-old-me and so many sleepless nights (and mornings and afternoons). The execution is perfect too, especially in the abstraction of the swaddling as the goal is indeed to leave nothing but the baby's face visible and the icon captures this so well. That it doubles so seamlessly as a toggle button is almost magical and the concept pays off perfectly in animation.<span></span> The wordmark takes a more serious approach with a simple sans serif and an all uppercase treatment, which at first I thought was a bit harsh or not cuddly enough but I think it's actually quite beneficial to balance out the cuteness of the logo with something more clinical to help indicate that Sleep Origin provides some order and rigor to get the baby to sleep. To help bring back some warm and fuzzy feelings are the spot illustrations with a fun, wobbly and textured aesthetic in a single color and some charming simplifications of common objects like calendars, alarm clocks, and window blinds. The identity uses a single typeface, <a href="https://heavyweight-type.com/fonts/nuckle/detail" target="_blank">Nuckle</a>, and a vibrant color palette. Kind of an odd combination between design elements and subject matter but it works for the most part. It would be easy for this identity to end up looking like a nursery or baby clothes store so I do appreciate the simplicity of the applications. Needless to say, the lenticular printing business card is genius. Overall, a great identity for a small, local business that now looks like it could expand into a franchise helping babies go to sleep nation-wide.</p>
