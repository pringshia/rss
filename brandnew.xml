                                            <p><strong>Relevant quote</strong><br /><em>The subtle shift from ‘Bella and Duke’ to ‘Bella+Duke’ brought the brand’s mission into sharper focus. The addition of the ‘+’ symbolises the brand’s promise to offer something greater, underscoring its commitment to pet health and wellbeing. Another pivotal change was ensuring both a cat, and a dog, took centre stage in the brand’s symbol. Previously, cats played a quieter role, despite their growing importance to the business. It’s a visual and strategic alignment that clarifies Bella+Duke’s full offering to customers and is an internal reminder that cats are a key part of the brand’s future.<br /><br />Big change carries the risk of disrupting online sales, counteracting against commercial goals of a rebrand. To safeguard against this, we collaborated with Bella+Dukes’s marketing and digital teams. Addressing concerns head-on avoided disruption, and seized the opportunity to test and optimise performance across the entire sales funnel — driving measurable success, and better results without compromising the business’s core objectives.

                                            <p><strong>Opinion</strong><br />
                                            The old logo was relatively fine although it's unclear what animal the icon was… at first I thought it was a cat facing forward but, after reading the design quote that cats are now being integrated into the identity, I am thinking it was a dog seen from the side. Perhaps there was some brilliance to its ambiguousness and that it was able to give both cat and dog. The new logo introduces an icon that embeds a dog and a cat into a plus sign through some clever interplay of positive and negative. It's a hard trick to pull off and I feel like it both succeeds and fails at the same time.<span></span> It takes a little <em>too</em> long to decode, especially the dog and at small sizes it's almost impossible to tell what's going on but once you know what the icon is doing, it's hard not to appreciate it. In the couple of lock-ups shown, the wordmark might be a little overpowering even though it's doing the correct thing of matching the size and weight of the plus sign with the geometric sans serif. I like the short ascenders a lot and I'm grateful they resisted the urge to make the stems of the ascenders have one rounded corner to look like the ears of the cat.<span></span> The identity is fine but perhaps goes in one too many directions that don't quite gel together. First, there is the headline typeface, <a href="https://www.allcapstype.com/typefaces/youth" target="_blank">Youth</a> — coincidentally, it looks a lot <a href="https://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/new_logo_and_identity_for_momo_by_m___n_associates.php" target="_blank">like today's custom display typeface on Reviewed</a> — that has a fun personality and more or less correlates to the logo in its geometric-ness. Then there are the more slick diagram-like gestures over the photography, which start to look more like pet food made in a lab. Then there is the contrast of the pet photography between the advertising and social media that some looks AI, some is user generated, and some is stock photography, so it's hard to get a good read on what exactly they are going for. Overall, it's hard to pinpoint what the main message is or what kind of fur-baby-parents they are trying to reach but there is definitely an underlying charm to this.</p>

<p>The logo evolution is as subtle as it gets and, yes, probably none of the 30 million users will notice but at least we, as designers on a design blog, can now rest at night knowing that the “o”s have a proper overshoot and the “m”s are more balanced around their shoulders. The logo seems to have also shed its holding shape and full name descriptor to help signal confidence in its own equity and that the name MoMo doesn&#8217;t need to be explained anymore than Federal Express once did before adopting FedEx.</p>

<blockquote>The core concept of MoMo&#8217;s rebranding is a visual system inspired deeply by the visual structure of paper banknotes. We translated the familiar textures, colors, layers, and detailed patterns of currency design into a digital format, creating a brand identity that feels both secure and dynamic.</blockquote><h3><a href="https://www.behance.net/gallery/211209045/MoMo-Rebrand" target="_blank" rel="noopener">M — N Associates project page</a></h3>

<p>The core identity elements are all inspired by paper banknotes and it&#8217;s interesting to see how M — N Associates took the same inspiration as <a href="https://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/new_logo_and_identity_for_wise_by_ragged_edge.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ragged Edge for Wise</a> and translated it into a completely different vibe, one that is super friendly, accessible, and geared towards a broader audience. Neither one is better than the other and both are perfectly appropriate for their context and audience. Here, the detailed engravings of banknotes are abstracted into thick-stroked, colorful patterns that can be overlaid to generate shading of monotone colors and add a whole lot of texture to the illustrations (as you will see further down below). The foil security patch often found in banknotes is transformed into a thick typing cursor made from the logo and a shifting combination of squares. It&#8217;s such an unexpected graphic approach and brand asset but it works amazingly well.</p>

<blockquote>MoMo&#8217;s new family are MoMo Trust Display, Trust Sans, and MoMo Signature, designed to enhance its human-centric and user-focused identity.<br /><br />MoMo Trust Display and Trust Sans draw inspiration from the MoMo logotype, incorporating subtle cues from the rounded, approachable forms that define the brand’s core look. MoMo Signature, inspired by handwritten signatures, adds a personal touch that reinforces trust and individuality.<br /><br />Together, these typefaces convey a seamless blend of professionalism and warmth, reflecting MoMo’s role as a reliable, user-friendly financial partner.</blockquote><h3><a href="https://www.behance.net/gallery/211209045/MoMo-Rebrand" target="_blank" rel="noopener">M — N Associates project page</a></h3>

<p>The type family further enhances the friendly and accessible tone with a pair of geometric-ish sans serifs, one for display headlines and one for more general use. While I remain not-a-fan of stemless/spurless sans serifs I&#8217;ll admit that this structure works quite nicely in the Display typeface and its curved-corner solution for letters with angles in them like the “M”, “N”, and “Z”. The script companion is delightful and it works perfectly to deliver the messaging by mixing in with the sans serif… a ton of examples of those combos can be found <a href="https://www.momo.vn/tro-thu-tai-chinh" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a> — you can translate the site to your language to get a better sense.</p>

<blockquote>Introducing a collection of lively people illustrations, filled with subtle wavy money patterns in vibrant new colors that expand the &#8220;MoMoverse&#8221; into the biggest brand element. These illustrations capture a playful, finance-inspired world full of humor and everyday financial activities, resonating with local culture and daily life. This approach creates a friendly, relatable brand presence that feels close to users&#8217; lifestyles, making MoMo an essential part of Vietnam’s financial landscape.</blockquote><h3><a href="https://www.behance.net/gallery/211209045/MoMo-Rebrand" target="_blank" rel="noopener">M — N Associates project page</a></h3>

<p>The illustrations are very charming and I love the application of the banknote textures. At times, the illustrations can feel a little <em>too</em> youthful and like it&#8217;s not the most grown-up of financial apps but I am pretty sure the tone is very much on purpose in order to connect with as broad an audience as possible and easily help convey the various services the app offers.</p>

<blockquote>The MoMo rebranding employs a money layering layout system consisting of four distinct layers: Security Layer &#8211; Content Layer &#8211; Visual Layer &#8211; Background Layer. Together, these layers create a cohesive visual experience that balances security, functionality, and creativity, reinforcing MoMo&#8217;s position as a friendly and trustworthy financial partner.</blockquote><h3><a href="https://www.behance.net/gallery/211209045/MoMo-Rebrand" target="_blank" rel="noopener">M — N Associates project page</a></h3>

<p>Not a whole lot in actual application but the layout system is very smart, evoking the layering approach of banknotes but with its own set of playful ingredients that provide ample flexibility as shown below in what I imagine are in-house generated applications that are easily and smoothly on brand, helping establish a new, recognizable visual language.</p>

The graphic identity we came up with revolves around an in-house typogram, made up of unexpected links between typefaces, with certain angles twisted to resemble rubber cables. A symbol based on the letter H completes the scheme, recalling the path of cables.

                                            <p><strong>Opinion</strong><br />
                                            I had never thought about light switches for more than a minute in my life but after seeing <a href="https://www.switchbytsee.com/portfolio/category/18-nos-marques.html" target="_blank">the company's inventory</a> I am now rethinking my light switch ambivalence and am totally obsessed with the <a href="https://www.switchbytsee.com/portfolio/category/25-katy-paty.html" target="_blank">Katy Paty Roo</a>. Let's get to the matter at hand though. The old name and logo were very literal and generic but, to their credit, they were clear and concise even if the icon in the logo leaned more digital switch than analog switch.<span></span> The new name places more emphasis on the “electric” aspect of switches and lights but I'm not sure if working “hectic” into it is the most positive of associations when it comes to lights and their wiring. It's fun to read and say though, especially with a French accent. The wordmark also finds inspiration behind the scenes by mimicking how thick lighting cables twist and pinch, taking an unexpected and fun approach to building straightforward characters like the “H” and “E” for a memorable and unique logo. I'm not convinced by the connection on the baseline of the “L” and the “E” or the unconventional “C”s but I'm also not mad at them in any way… just an acquired taste.<span></span> The “H” monogram is quite nice and I really like the positive-negative interplay of the shapes inside the circle. The “H” also serves as the basis for a pattern where the letter expands and connects in different ways while allowing Brand Brothers to do their Brand Brothers thing that revels in patterning and repetition with bright colors and plenty of sans serif typography. Overall, a sense of connection/connectivity does flow through the identity while also having a bit of a Mid Century interior design vibe going on.</p>

                                            <p>First celebrated in 2011 as an annual Chicago street festival taking place in the city&#8217;s Pilsen neighborhood, <a href="https://www.chicagolowriderfestival.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Slow&#038;Low: Chicago Lowrider Festival</a> is a cultural heritage event celebrating the Lowrider movement and the customized car as “a way of expressing beauty and self-expression by owners, master craftspeople, and innovative mechanics”. Co-founded by Peter Kepha and Lauren M. Pacheco, 2024 will mark the third year since the event has been held in Chicago&#8217;s Navy Pier, taking over the venue&#8217;s 170,000 square feet with a display of more than 250 meticulously customized automobiles, along with a collection of uniquely modified bicycles and motorcycles. Attracting over 15,000 people to the single day event, attendees are also treated to a curated program of local deejays, folkloric dancers, live musical performances, a children’s play area, and pop-up art installations. The identity for the event has been designed by local firm, <a href="https://span.studio/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Span</a>, who have designed the identities for the <a href="https://span.studio/projects/chicago-lowrider-festival-2023" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2023</a> and <a href="https://span.studio/projects/chicago-lowrider-festival-2022" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2022</a> events as well.</p>
<span id="more-299662"></span>

<blockquote>For the 2024 festival, Span collaborated closely with the curators to craft a gala-like visual identity. This process began with co-founder and curator Peter Kepha’s sketches of chain motifs in archway form, symbolizing growth and achievement—ideals central to Kepha’s life in the Chicano community.</blockquote><h3><a href="https://span.studio/projects/chicago-lowrider-festival-2024" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Span project page</a></h3>

<blockquote>The 2024 Slow &amp; Low identity that Span designed amplifies a story of exquisite craftsmanship and celebration, drawing inspiration from the intricate artistry of lowrider culture. The typographic palette features a customized version of Lucas Sharp and Wei Huang’s blackletter typeface, <a href="https://www.sharptype.co/typefaces/respira" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Respira</a>. Adding a layer of joyful elegance this scribe-like blackletter is complemented by Alejandro Paul’s <a href="https://www.sudtipos.com/font/burgues-script" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Burgues Script</a>, based on master calligrapher Louis Madarasz’s work. Rounding out the collection is Lucas Sharp’s limited edition <a href="https://www.sharptype.co/typefaces/sharp-freehand">Sharp Freehand</a>, a calligraphic typeface inspired by the master letterer, Oscar Ogg and Sharp’s <a href="https://www.sharptype.co/typefaces/greenstone" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Greenstone</a> that is connected to the tradition of tombstone carving. Together, from chains to script, the festival identity offers a striking, refined edge that mirrors the masterpieces showcased at Slow &amp; Low.</blockquote><h3><a href="https://span.studio/projects/chicago-lowrider-festival-2024" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Span project page</a></h3>

<p>While the organization&#8217;s logo features one style of blackletter, Span introduced a more ornate, display option — <a href="https://www.sharptype.co/typefaces/respira" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Respira</a> — in 2022 for the titular “Slow&amp;Low” event logo, which has a more bombastic and relatively outlandish aesthetic that better matches the artistic approach to the cars than the one in the logo, which, no offense, is more of a standard issue blackletter. New this year is the introduction of gold chains — as in those worn by folks around their neck and those used to transfer power from the pedals to the drive-wheel of a bicycle to propel it — that twist, turn, and loop around, literally adding bling to the blackletter. The gold chain effect is, amazingly, recreated using only yellow, white, and black with zero gradients in sight, which is not an easy trick to pull off convincingly to render the material.</p>

<p>The two previous years were also relatively &#8220;shy&#8221; in their typography… at least compared to this year, where more exuberant and unexpected choices are introduced to support, complement, and lift the blackletter and make the identity feel as robust as the more-is-more approach to the cars. <a href="https://www.sudtipos.com/font/burgues-script" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Burgues Script</a> adds so much flair to the identity while <a href="https://www.sharptype.co/typefaces/sharp-freehand">Sharp Freehand</a> serves as the more readable and “normal” counterpart. Rounding out the ingredients are the thin star-like shapes that were first used last year but that feel much more integrated this year as they share the thick-and-thin gestures of the typographic palette.</p>

<p>The applications then simply let it rip, deploying the elements in as many surfaces as possible and integrating photography beautifully into the system, whether it&#8217;s simply by overlaying chains on top of them as seen below, or by framing it inside chain compositions as in the posters above. That first collection of posters in the cluster of images above goes <em>hard</em>.</p>

<p class="end">The identity becomes repetitive, which could be misconstrued as a negative criticism but I actually mean it as a compliment, drenching the massive venue in so many gold chains, so much blackletter, and so little white space. Overall, I think this is a fantastic identity that captures the energy of the event and becomes a great backdrop and complement to the cars and the attendees, celebrating the maximalism and abundance of self expression of Lowrider culture.</p>
