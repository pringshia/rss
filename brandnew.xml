Why is this on Brand New? Because despite the band being on hiatus for 15 years, the above image is a fantastic case of brand recognition that triggers an association to the band&#8217;s classic logo, all based on some very simple and generic design traits: An italic sans serif, two thick strokes, a rectangle. Instantly Oasis.

Trust. It starts and ends with trust. Human to human. Data-point to data-point. So, we started writing and a brand new brand narrative and strategic platform emerged under the umbrella: “Towards a future we can all trust”.<br /><br />From here we created a new brand name, Epical, and crafted a new visual identity radiating with ambition, warmth and of course trust. Epical is here and launched, equipped with all the tools necessary to bring their brand to life anyhow and everywhere. A new identity showing the way for trust-makers all over the Nordics to join their quest and build a future we can trust. Thank you Epical for a brilliant collaboration!

                                            <p><strong>Opinion</strong><br />
                                            Given the company's recent founding (2023) and that Identity Works also created the name, I am guessing the old logo was meant as nothing more than a placeholder but they still tried to infuse some personality into the generic geometric sans serif wordmark by curving the terminals of the “e”, “i”, and “c”. It wasn't good. I mean, it was properly executed, it just resulted in some weird-looking letterforms. The new logo is far more interesting if also far more trendy with the <a href="https://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/tag/loops" target="_blank">loop-y sans serif treatment</a> that was <a href="https://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/the_year_in_review_part_2_recurring_trends_2021.php" target="_blank">a big trend in 2021</a> and that we've seen twice — <a href="https://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/new_logo_and_identity_for_planu_by_holmandesign.php" target="_blank">A</a>, <a href="https://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/new_logo_and_identity_for_ovarian_cancer_action_by_revolt.php" target="_blank">B</a> — this month alone. Nonetheless, it's a nice-looking logo that has been well drawn. I'm still trying to understand what the name means… is it something so epic, that it's epical? Something that's at the epicenter of something else? Something special? Interpretations welcome.<span></span> The identity goes in a number of different directions, all of them interesting on their own but I'm not sure if they belong together. First, there is some charming spot illustrations of people doing things with geometric shapes. Their simplicity and motion are great. Then there is a 3D, fiber-optic-ish loop that is delicious to look at and so expertly crafted but also a bit of a head-scratcher as to its purpose other than, perhaps, the notion of funneling data. Then there is the headline typography that uses <a href="https://www.r-typography.com/fonts/flecha-m" target="_blank">Flecha M</a>, which is a fabulous serif but its hard-angled serifs feel at odds with the logo, the illustrations, and the 3D loop. It perhaps has too much personality to blend in. Still, the applications are done with plenty of conviction, are well crafted, and make a visual splash. Overall, the identity is unclear about what kind of territory it wants to live in — it's part telecom, part DTC food or drink brand, part lifestyle, part tech — but it does look slick and polished.</p>

                                            <p>Established in 2012, <a href="https://www.chime.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chime</a> is a fintech company that provides simplified, basic banking services with no monthly fees. Through two banking partners, The Bancorp Bank, N.A. and Stride Bank, N.A. — as Chime is <em>not</em> a bank — users can open a checking account with no monthly fees and a high-yield savings account with automatic savings features along with popular perks like early direct deposit (up to two days) and fee-free overdraft up to $200. Headquartered in San Francisco, with additional offices in Chicago and Vancouver, its reported number of users is somewhere between 15 and 22 million but there is no official number available — point is, it&#8217;s big. This week, Chime began rolling out a new identity designed by <a href="https://jkrglobal.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jones Knowles Ritchie</a>.</p>

<figcaption>Samples of old identity.</figcaption>
</figure>

<blockquote>For over a decade, Chime has challenged the traditional banking sector, recognizing its inadequacy in serving everyday Americans. The evolution of its brand identity delivers an enhanced experience focused on trust, stability, and security, resonating with a growing audience committed to defining their own aspirations. By emphasizing &#8216;progress&#8217; throughout the design, Chime continues to redefine how financial progress is expressed in the modern era.<br /><br />The updated identity strengthens the brands associations with trust and security, while disrupting traditional banking codes through the &#8216;portal to progress&#8217; design concept. This reflects Chime&#8217;s innovative philosophy, which is key to fostering advocacy within the community.</blockquote><h3>Jones Knowles Ritchie provided text</h3>

</figure>

<p>While the logo remains the same in this new identity, it&#8217;s easy to see from the samples of the old identity that Chime was in need of a boost as its soft pastel colors, drop-shadow-ed typography, and multiple illustration styles were feeling a little dated and not nearly as impactful as it might need to be in today&#8217;s world. It was also a bit shy and considering that it is reportedly the leading non-bank-banking-app, it didn&#8217;t feel like a category leader.</p>

<blockquote><strong>Focus On Smart, Simple, and Easy.</strong><br /> The refresh aims to continue enhancing what Chime’s members love most about their experience &#8211; ease and simplicity &#8211; building on its reputation with over 1 million 5-star reviews. These updates emphasize Chime&#8217;s credibility and foundational values. The brand strengthens its primary green palette to evoke security and trust, while introducing a secondary palette to convey freedom, ease, and aspiration. JKR developed an accessible and versatile type system to make the brand&#8217;s messaging more inclusive and accessible to all. The identity includes an intuitive UI toolkit, responsive iconography, and motion principles that highlight forward momentum, unlocking, and the transformative experience associated with using the product as a window to financial progress.</blockquote><h3>Jones Knowles Ritchie provided text</h3>

<figcaption>Chime Unlocked. By Colophon Foundry.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Driving the identity is a new type family with something borrowed, something new, and something script. Leading the way with something borrowed is Chime Saans, which uses Displaay&#8217;s <a href="https://displaay.net/typeface/saans/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Saans</a> as its starting point although I&#8217;m not sure how it is unique… I think the lowercase &#8220;l&#8221; has a little extra curl that the original doesn&#8217;t. For something new, partnering once more with <a href="https://www.colophon-foundry.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Colophon Foundry</a>, a crisp new serif with some quirky gestures like a tucked-in leg of the “R” serves as a great contrast. For something script, Colophon also created a display typeface with some groovy, loopy characters that play off of the “m” in the Chime logo and that are sprinkled in small doses in Chime Saans. All three make for a comprehensive typographic family that can strike different tones, from serious to playful to informative.</p>

<figcaption>Icon set and typography.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The typography can also be infused with some fun, single-color icons-slash-emojis that replace letters within sentences in fun, contextual ways, e.g. little plants for “grow”, happy face for “progress”, lock for “safe”. These work equally well within the sans or the serif and when shown together as in the green on green samples above, it looks pretty fantastic.</p>

<blockquote><strong>Be More Relatable. </strong><br />The new illustration approach is geared towards enhancing the relatability of the brand by depicting everyday moments. By developing an intuitive typographic language that incorporates expressive alternates and emojis, JKR maintained the soul of the brand to help Chime continue to connect with its growing community of over 7 million members.</blockquote><h3>Jones Knowles Ritchie provided text</h3>

<blockquote><strong>Make Everyday Progress Feel Effortless.</strong><br />The concept of &#8220;portals&#8221; in the design system embody how regular individuals effortlessly access financial advancement. This mirrors Chime&#8217;s products, crafted to alleviate stress and streamline daily progress. By highlighting the synergy between the card and phone, the brand strengthens the connection between product usage and financial progress. Capturing everyday purchase moments through vignettes and photography reinforces the idea that incremental steps and basic usage lead to progress, making the everyday more aspirational.</blockquote><h3>Jones Knowles Ritchie provided text</h3>

<p>Ticking off another box in the JKR formula is a great series of illustrations with some fun, wobbly line work presenting a very diverse crew of Chime users… all leaning exponentially young and clearly signaling who their target audience is. Adding some conceptual flair to the illustrations are the smartphone- and credit-card shaped portals through which these young people go through to achieve their financial goals. It&#8217;s a very clever graphic and storytelling device that works beautifully when animated but gets the point across equally well in static applications. The spot illustrations are great too and all the subtle animations add a ton of personality.</p>

<p>The applications all look great, putting the various elements to good use and not trying to go overboard with complex layouts or needing to flex too hard beyond traditional compositions of left-aligned big type, a photo or an illustration, and the logo. The simplicity of the design is enriched with the strong personality and visual presence of each of the various elements. I feel like I should say more about it but it&#8217;s really fairly straightforward. </p>

<p class="end">Overall, this has all the trimmings of a JKR identity… it&#8217;s visually vibrant, bold, and playful and is delivered with a confident and engaging tone of voice. This now better positions Chime as the go-to option for online banking for a new generation of users that have never filled out a check or faced the indignities of having forgotten to endorse one when depositing a literal paycheck.</p>

Our job is to shift culture to a place where every person from every background can thrive. We work with people and companies who care about creating more inclusive ways of being and smashing the systems that divide us. Through our training programmes, jobs board, community, creative work and consulting, we challenge norms, question outdated ways of doing things, and galvanise people into taking positive action against long-standing injustice and inequity. We envision a future where rampant barriers to opportunities and progress no longer exist. We imagine a world where we can lean into conversations about our differences without getting defensive and polarised. We believe in changing hearts and minds through empathetic, emotionally intelligent, and well-informed interactions, not shame, blame, or judgment.&#8221;</p>

To achieve this, we must examine, unlearn, relearn and act — a continuous work in progress. To bring this strategy to life, we drew inspiration from construction and work-in-progress signage, crafting a bold, graphic approach to grab attention.<br /><br />The design system utilizes shapes from the public domain, which are combined to create scalable and adaptable patterns. This results in a bold and accessible language which can be used to create engaging videos, presentations and infographics.

                                            <p><strong>Opinion</strong><br />
                                            The old logo was technically and design-wise pretty good, with a simple geometric sans serif in a centered composition — missed opportunity to perfectly align the “THE”s — but it was a little too generic and it looked more like the logo for a box subscription service than a social impact company. Key word “impact”. The new logo addresses that with a significantly bolder sans serif and one with a much more unique aesthetic — Dinamo's <a href="https://abcdinamo.com/typefaces/gravity" target="_blank">ABC Gravity</a> but it sacrifices the readability of the name in favor of a less then effective rebus where the square is meant to read as “Box” and it doesn't quite do it. As a side effect, though, the company now looks as if its name is, simply, “OTHER”, which is bold and impactful and more reminiscent of checking the “Other:” box in all those forms that ask for your gender, race, profession, or other personal detail that doesn't fit in any other box. See? Right there… effective naming. Anyway… it's a strong logo and it has some good and fun flexibility where it can expand below the wordmark, adopt patterns, or deliver imagery.<span></span> The identity sticks with simplicity and iconography but takes an unexpected detour into construction and traffic signs, which I guess is indeed a nice metaphor for the work-in-progress we are as humans in embracing other humans and how much direction and navigation we need to do it right. With these ingredients, things get a little wild with some acid color combinations and a medley of patterns that spin, pan, and shift in hypnotic ways while ABC Gravity maintains its center of, um, gravity solid and being unfazed by the stuff going on behind it, given its sturdiness. The slightly random applications don't quite help tell a story of what this identity does in real life but I found the application of it to <a href="https://otherbox.co/blog" target="_blank">their blog posts</a> to be a good, if not perfect, use of their visual language to adopt other cultural references and give them their own spin. (Killer tote though!) Overall, this feels like it properly reflects the company's bold attitude and desire to make a difference through an eye-catching, attention-demanding, shaking-by-the-shoulders identity.</p>

Founded by the government of the State of São Paulo, it is recognized internationally for its artistic excellence and commitment to musical education and locally for promoting cultural and social transformations. The orchestra is formed by 105 musicians, Brazilian and foreign, with Thierry Fischer as Musical Director and Principal Conductor. In addition to the orchestra, Osesp is made up of a professional choir, chamber groups, a music publishing house, and an educational platform. Late last year, Osesp introduced a new identity designed by local firm, <a href="https://polar.ltda/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Polar</a>.</p>

<blockquote>In 2023, Polar was invited by Osesp to revisit its graphic legacy and develop a new visual identity, adaptable to its diverse application needs and capable of attracting a new audience to discover it. The new identity, aiming to be a sensory and captivating invitation to rediscover classical music, was conceived through the juxtaposition of two distinct layers.<br /><br />The first layer, rational and disciplined by nature, emphasizes the dialogue between time, rhythm, and tempo. This approach is reflected in vertical bars that run through the entire graphic system, as well as in the flexible logo, where the letters forming &#8220;Osesp&#8221; are arranged like musical notes in a nod to a music score.</blockquote><h3><a href="https://polar.ltda/osesp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Polar project page</a></h3>

<p>The old logo was not good, with far too many things going on in its attempt to give each initial its own distinct design treatment, with a filled-in circle for the “O” in “Orquestra”, a more demure sans serif in “SE” for “Sinfônica do Estado”, and then a mix of an oversize script and a bolder and slightly bigger sans serif in the “S” and the “P” for “São Paulo”. All while adding a conducting baton to separate, for some reason, the “O” from “SE” and cramming the full name in yet another typeface mixing in bold and regular weights. The new logo is a delightful simplification that may not be the most exciting nor most original (as vertical and horizontal lines are a well-worn design trope in symphony/orchestra identities) but it hints at music sheets with the different vertical positions of the initials and it effortlessly conveys dynamism with a dose of seriousness thanks to the no-BS sans serif, Blakletra&#8217;s <a href="https://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/new_logo_and_identity_for_sao_paulo_symphony_orchestra_by_polar.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gal Gothic</a>, which is a pretty great sans serif, that is like a warmer and more approachable version of Univers but that still has that classic Swiss-esque rigidity. The two lock-ups do the best they can with the long name and are actually quite successful in integrating it, particularly the stacked version.</p>

<blockquote>The second layer of the visual identity focuses on emotion and seeks to express, with sensitivity, the experience of listening to and watching the orchestra. In this aspect, a grouping of shapes reacts to musical information, transcending the technical aspect of sheet music. The abstract graphics represent the sensations and moods evoked by the music. To create these elements, a generative design system called &#8220;Instrument&#8221; was developed. In this system, a sound input is visually translated into compositions of ellipses, allowing for the creation of infinite compositions and a connection with the pieces they reference.</blockquote><h3><a href="https://polar.ltda/osesp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Polar project page</a></h3>

<p>The two main identity elements are great. First you have the barebones typography with just the right amount of vertical bars to ground it, always used in black or white only and then you have the exuberant, colorful patterns. The two balance each other perfectly with the simplicity and clarity of the typography being able to sit comfortably (and readable-y) on top of the onslaught of circles and ellipsis in sometimes jarring color combinations. While most identities tend to work best when set in motion, I think this one is the opposite, where the static applications are more successful in creating an interesting tension between elements and where the motion and depth is implied. Once animated, it&#8217;s a little too much and starts to become distracting. This is not meant to knock the motion work at all… as it IS good but more to acknowledge how well the static versions work.</p>

<blockquote>The color palette, with its variety, provides the flexibility needed to reflect the diversity of emotions conveyed by the orchestra. Additionally, it facilitates the creation of derivative identities for specific projects, keeping the brand constantly refreshed over the years. The typographic voice of the institution is entrusted to &#8220;Gal&#8221;, designed by the Brazilian type foundry Blackletra, with a highly functional design that connects with the music universe from its inception.</blockquote><h3><a href="https://polar.ltda/osesp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Polar project page</a></h3>

<p>The applications all look really great and the flexibility of the system is on full display as any given pattern works seamlessly with any given amount of information needed on each piece. I also quite like the flexibility of the logo and how it can appear on its own or with the full name or sometimes even shrunk down as seen directly above where there is no baseline variation. It would be interesting to see how the patterns and type interacted with photography as a human/musician element might be missing in all of this.</p>

<p class="end">Overall, a really strong system that operates within some of the traditional approaches to identity for cultural institutions but that manages to add its own, unique flair in an unexpected way that brings Osesp&#8217;s music to visual life.</p>
