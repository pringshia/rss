Powered by atomic-level simulations and artificial intelligence, we design dynamic peptides that take drugs straight to their target – outperforming other treatment delivery systems. By daring to deliver therapeutics in a novel way we are changing the game for drug development and bringing hope to patients with previously untreatable diseases. At ProteinQure, we pride ourselves on our unique, diverse and cross-disciplinary team that brings together experts from experimental and computational biology, machine learning and software engineering.&#8221;</p>

                                            <p><strong>Relevant quote</strong><br /><em>The ‘Qure’ symbol is a graphic, geometric representation of a therapeutic payload (drug) being delivered to a cell by a custom-built peptide and linker. It functions both as a standalone symbol and as an integral part of the logotype.<br /><br />The three shapes in the Qure symbol are part of a suite of eight brand shapes, or ‘cells,’ that are used to create dynamic patterns and imagery. These patterns represent the multitude of amino acids as well as the vast datasets and code that ProteinQure works with. The ‘cells’ also scale to larger sizes to serve as icons, image containers, UI elements, and ‘mosaic’ style numerals for signposting. This system is endlessly flexible yet cohesive.<br /><br />A restricted colour palette of orange and dark blue is used throughout, with multiple shades of each. This approach allows the identity to adapt seamlessly between dark and light modes while reflecting ProteinQure’s singular focus.<br /><br />In animation, the identity conveys a restless energy and dynamism—deliberately bold with a rebellious edge.

                                            <p><strong>Opinion</strong><br />
                                            The old logo was quite sad, with its clip-art-y protein strand drawing and scrawny wordmark. It was difficult to take the company or its peptides seriously and I, for one, am very peculiar about my peptides. (I don't even know what a peptide is but that's peptide the point. Sorry.) The new logo is a major improvement, introducing a bolder sans serif that exudes more seriousness and scientific prowess. It has one too many things going on between the angled “r”s and “t”s and the stemless “u” which leave the “e”s and “n” looking a little out of place and end up being distracting from the rather nice “Q” that I also wonder if it would have worked better always on its own as opposed to embedding it within the wordmark and allowing people to better appreciate its details. The explanation of the three shapes that make up the tail of the “Q” is a little complicated — in the sense that it's not obvious at first glance without someone telling you what it's all about — but valid. The amount of animations and renders of the “Q” and the full wordmark is almost comical but, hey, why not?<span></span> The identity has some nice elements going on, starting with the color palette of peach and dark blue, which are kind of unexpected for a biotech brand. A series of geometric shapes become the building blocks for some rather nice patterns and illustrations in a <em>Matrix</em>-y aesthetic or, more relevantly and recent, reminiscent of <a href="https://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/new_logo_and_identity_for_cit_by_make.php" target="_blank">these patterns and illustrations for CI&amp;T by Make</a>. These ones are trippy and cool to look at and I really like the duotone effect, which feels science-y. There are also some fairly wild and detailed 3D illustrations and video of peptides doing peptide things, which are kind of enthralling if a little bit creepy too. Other than a highly relevant skateboard, not much in application but their website provides plenty of bang for your buck to experience what the identity is all about. Overall, the identity goes all in on exuding Science with a capital “S” and for the most part succeeds even if at times it gets carried away by visual effects.</p>

Headquartered in Tallinn, Estonia, their various services are available in more than 600 cities in 50 countries, supporting more than 4.5 million drivers and couriers to earn a living, and serving over 200 million customers to get a ride in minutes, order food and grocery delivery, rent a car or scooter, improve business travel and more. Earlier this month, Bolt introduced a new identity designed in-house.</p>

<blockquote>Despite becoming a household name in Europe, Africa, and beyond, our visual identity didn&#8217;t see much expansion. Over time, the look and feel that once made us distinct made it difficult to scale our brand at the pace we grow as a business — or provide a great experience across our entire product range.<br /><br />So, we decided it was time to shed some of our brand elements to make way for a refreshed look. One that could keep up with the rest of Bolt while staying true to the mission that got us where we are today.</blockquote><h3><a href="https://bolt.eu/en/refresh/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bolt brand refresh page</a></h3>

<p>The first time I heard of Taxify (which is different from Cabify) was <a href="https://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/new_name_and_logo_for_bolt.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">back in 2019 when the company changed its name from Taxify to Bolt</a> at a time when it had a modest 25 million users and only offered “traditional” ride share services. Slowly but surely, Bolt has grown its user base and expanded its service offering — shifts that occasionally lead to a logo redesign but Bolt has resisted the urge and instead focused on building around it.</p>

<blockquote>Our branding is present in both the digital and physical world, so we updated our colours to work equally well in both. Now, the green on a Bolt car and courier bag is the same green as our apps and website. We also introduced a darker shade to ensure enough contrast for anyone to easily read our online comms, use our products, and recognise our brand.</blockquote><h3><a href="https://bolt.eu/en/refresh/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bolt brand refresh page</a></h3>

<blockquote>One of our most prominent brand updates is the shift from a 2D to 3D illustration style. The flat Corporate Memphis style had frankly grown stale and lost its original charm. And for the millions of people who use our apps daily, that wasn’t good enough. We incorporated more dimension, versatility, and movement across over 400 new illustrations that come to life with simple animations. And most importantly, they make using Bolt a little more fun. </blockquote><h3><a href="https://bolt.eu/en/refresh/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bolt brand refresh page</a></h3>

<blockquote>To be ready for the year and years ahead, we updated Bolt’s font from Euclid to Inter. Inter is an open-source, Google-backed font that supports over 990 languages.  Compared to Euclid, it’s more technical and versatile. Now, we can ensure readability and consistency across a growing range of internal and external communications, most of which are localised into hundreds of languages.</blockquote><h3><a href="https://bolt.eu/en/refresh/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bolt brand refresh page</a></h3>

<figcaption>Typography.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Since I&#8217;m not a regular Bolt user I am not very familiar with how it shows up in the world on a regular basis but just like I recognize Uber&#8217;s black color or Lyft&#8217;s pink, it&#8217;s more than safe to say that Bolt has an equivalent in its emerald green color and a very nice one at that. I point out the obvious because one of the key new elements in the identity is the introduction of a darker shade of green as well as an embrace of black accents, which add up to a slick and elegant new presence that brings out the best in the original green hue. Previously using <a href="https://www.swisstypefaces.com/fonts/euclid/#Circular%20B" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Euclid</a>, Bolt has shifted to <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Inter" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Inter</a>, which probably takes a big load off the budget for its licensing costs and despite being a free type family, <a href="https://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/new_identity_for_iso_by_motherbird.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">when used correctly</a>, Inter can be one of the best-looking workhorse typefaces out there and it&#8217;s delivered with precision and confidence in this identity. Another fun, new addition are some lovely 3D illustrations in a matte finish that, while they are technically extruded versions of Corporate Memphis (with their big limbs and minimalist facial features) now manage to look more lively and endearing.</p>

<blockquote>Over the years, we’ve become an inherent part of the urban landscape. So, we created a new sonic identity that blends in. “Qui” is a pleasant, modern, and optimistic family of sounds that are now played across all of our apps. And if you’re wondering what instrument you’re hearing, the answer is a disassembled Bolt scooter. Yes, you read that right.</blockquote><h3><a href="https://bolt.eu/en/refresh/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bolt brand refresh page</a></h3>

<figcaption>Sonic identity. Unmute for sound.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Judging sonic identity is a little outside my purview as I simply don&#8217;t have an ear for details but these are all fun sounds if, at times, a little too… high pitch or high frequency? Like, if you go from muted to unmuted in the video above and you catch it at the wrong time, your ears will ding but I guess that translates into being good alerts and getting users&#8217; attention.</p>

<blockquote>Our new look is complemented by an extensive library of custom imagery for a more authentic look. After dozens of photoshoots and many hours invested in establishing our own unique style, we now have the range and volume we need to deliver fresh, distinctive designs at the pace we launch products and features.  Every photo tells its own story. And when it needs the help of copy, our new layout system offers the flexibility to showcase both. </blockquote><h3><a href="https://bolt.eu/en/refresh/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bolt brand refresh page</a></h3>

<blockquote>We created a flexible grid system to support the growing range of dimensions, channels, and mediums we design for. More markets means more varied legislative requirements, from displaying copy in multiple languages to adding longer disclaimers for promos.

<p>The applications are all quite straightforward, perhaps bordering on too plain but what they lack in excitement they make up for in brand presence… meaning, every application looks like a Bolt application: The logo easily stands out no matter the size, the typography is simple and effective, and whenever there are no blocks of the signature green, the photography does a stellar job in infusing the applications with it, whether it&#8217;s by showing one of their products, styling the models with green clothing or accents, or simply by letting the urban nature (trees, shrubs, plants, etc.) add that green spark.</p>

<blockquote>This refresh wasn’t just about change. It also aligned the look of our apps. Until now, Bolt Food leaned towards colourful while Bolt stuck to green. Different is good, but we wanted to bridge the visual gap for the many customers who use both apps daily. Now, all our products share a unified green palette. And a range of accent elements allows us to highlight valuable information, while retaining consistency throughout.</blockquote><h3><a href="https://bolt.eu/en/refresh/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bolt brand refresh page</a></h3>

<p>The food delivery side of the operation can ramp things up just the right amount to make the service more attractive and attention-grabbing with its color-saturated photography and relatively more exuberant typography. The matching 3D spot illustrations are excellent… that triangle-cut sandwich brings me so much joy.</p>

United by their shared academic roots at École Polytechnique and experiences at Google DeepMind and Meta, they envisioned a different, audacious approach to artificial intelligence—to challenge the opaque-box nature of ‘big AI’, and making this cutting-edge technology accessible to all. This manifested into the company’s mission of democratizing artificial intelligence through open-source, efficient, and innovative AI models, products, and solutions.&#8221;</p>

This updated design transforms the original "M" with added eyes, ears, and a mouth, symbolizing the multimodal capabilities of Mistral AI’s technology.<br /><br />A Multimodal and Symbolic Design: <br />This redesigned logo reflects Mistral AI’s advanced ability to process and integrate various data types (text, images, and more). The cat’s inclusion pays homage to the early days of machine learning, where image recognition algorithms were trained on cat photos due to their abundance on the internet.<br /> <br />An Innovation in Automated Design: <br />Leveraging Mistral AI’s own technology, Sylvain Boyer Studio has created a scalable brand system where key visual elements—logo, colors, and typography—can be generated automatically with pixel-perfect precision. This pioneering approach allows users to quickly create or customize brand assets through a simple interaction with Mistral AI’s chat-agent.<br /> <br />A Record-breaking Success: <br />Since the rebranding and the launch of the Mistral AI Chat App, the app has achieved a remarkable milestone, becoming the most downloaded application in Europe within 24 hours. This unprecedented success highlights the strong connection between the brand’s new identity and its user base.

                                            <p><strong>Opinion</strong><br />
                                            The old logo was almost fine but for some odd reason, or perhaps just some poor SVG legacy issues, each pixel in the “M” had an outline, breaking any kind of unity the monogram could have had and adding unnecessary noise. The half-pixel drop shadow casting only to the left (as opposed to left and bottom) was also odd. It's not saying much but the old wordmark was the better element of the logo. The new logo takes the pixelated and striped “M” as the foundation with a clever twist to transform it into a cat and it's amazing that they were able to capture the essence of a cat in a 7-by-5 pixel grid. Its whiskers kill me. The reasoning behind the choice of a cat may not be obvious — it wasn't to me — but the explanation that it's because AI models were originally heavily trained on cat photos (because there were so many of them online) is very satisfying.<span></span> Less satisfying is the choice of Arial for the wordmark. Like, I get it… it's a system font, it's democratic, and any browser can display it but, man, what a drag of a font. It's not even used ironically or in any interesting way in the identity, it's just <em>there</em> and it's unfortunate as it gives everything an amateurish, unfinished look. The decision to double down on pixelated illustrations as an extension of the logo is fine and kind of charming but I question if such an old-school visual reference is the appropriate one for what's basically the future of tech.<span></span> The pixelated illustrations are actually pretty fun but they needed far more support than Arial and the absolutely bare-bones layouts that barely register as design. The color palette is actually quite nice and a welcome deviation from the traditional blues and purples of software and tech but the big winner in all of this is the name of Mistral AI's new AI assistant: <a href="https://mistral.ai/en/news/all-new-le-chat" target="_blank">le Chat</a>. Being a French, company, “chat” is French for cat and “chat” is, well, “chat” for “chatting with an AI bot” — plus, intentionally or not, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/1122kix/chatgpt_in_french_means/" target="_blank">it's a snarky swipe at ChatGPT</a>. Overall, this had a really strong start with the new cat icon and the pixelated illustrations were a step in the right direction but the default-looking identity is not particularly engaging or a strong enough lure away from other consumer AI options out there.</p>

                                            <p>For over 130 years, Al. Neyer built more than just structures — it built a reputation. Founded in 1894 as a family-owned design-build firm, the company evolved over the decades into a multidisciplinary powerhouse, with expertise spanning real estate development, architecture, and construction. In 2014, it transitioned to an employee-owned model, reinforcing a culture of shared success and long-term investment. Today, with a growing national presence and an expanding portfolio, the company has embarked on its most significant transformation yet: a new name, a new identity, and a bold new vision.</p>

<p>Enter <a href="https://www.merus1894.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Merus</a> — a name that signals both continuity and change. Led by Chicago, IL-based agency, <a href="https://www.onedesigncompany.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">One Design,</a> the rebrand sought to articulate the company’s evolution while staying true to its collaborative ethos. The renaming process was spearheaded by the Sausalito, CA-based office of <a href="https://www.lexiconbranding.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lexicon Branding,</a> known for its expertise in linguistic strategy, ensuring the new moniker captured both credibility and meaning. To introduce the brand, filmmaker <a href="https://www.houstonraef.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Houston Raef</a> and Creative Director and Brand Advisor <a href="https://www.brittanygrinham.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Brittany Grinham</a> crafted a compelling launch video, bringing Merus to life with a narrative that bridges heritage and forward momentum.</p>

<blockquote>
Over its 130 years in commercial real estate, Al. Neyer had evolved from a local, family-owned construction business into a national, employee-owned, vertically-integrated development company. But their name, brand, and website were stuck in the past. They needed a new identity and messaging that matched the progressive, multifaceted major player they had become in order to continue to attract the best talent, clients, and partners … all while honoring their 130 years of experience and brand equity.
<br /><br />
As an employee-owned company that works in multi-disciplinary teams, everything Al. Neyer does is defined by collaboration and partnership. Their new name, Merus, (created by Lexicon) is a combination of “merit” and “us” that intuitively communicates the company’s heart, soul, and work ethic. And we created an “M” monogram out of two solid shapes that build something stronger together; a symbol of intersection and integration. The architectural M symbol is paired with a new humanistic wordmark, creating an approachable visual tone.
<br /><br />
130 years of experience and reputation is not something the team wanted to leave behind. So we embraced the color red for continuity, brought architetctural linework into the new brand expression, and created a heritage logo to let even new audiences know that the company has been around since 1894.</blockquote>

<p>The old Al. Neyer logo may or may not have been born in the ’90s (I honestly don’t know), but it sure <em>looks</em> like it was — hailing from an era when corporate logos were either cheesily futuristic or woefully corporate, and somehow, this one managed to be both. The challenging collection of uppercase letterforms — especially the “E-Y-E” ligature — was a spacing nightmare, creating an awkward rhythm across the logotype. And let’s talk about that “R”, because someone clearly thought “cutting-edge” meant literally cutting out a chunk of the leg to carve out some uniqueness. The result is a Robocop-ish (which might actually be the wrong kind of slam, since the original Robocop logotype was pretty badass) wordmark that feels cold, clunky, and engineered in all the wrong ways. Meanwhile, the strapline feels like an afterthought — inelegant, unresolved, and just shoved in there. If there’s one redeeming quality, it’s the logomark — what I perceive to be a pair of abstract cupped hands that may or may not have been intended to represent the collaborative nature of the company and the convergence of various disciplines: architecture, design, construction. (Hmmm… cupped hands representing a convergence of disciplines? Where have I seen something like that before…? 🤔) But overall, this logo feels stuck in time — and not the <em>right</em> time — with a color palette that screams “Corporate PowerPoint template, circa 1998.”</p>

<p>The new name, Merus, is a smart and intentional evolution. A portmanteau of “merit” and “us,” it directly reflects the company’s ethos: collaboration, excellence, and an employee-driven culture. Unlike so many fabricated corporate names that feel clunky or forced, this one has an intuitive, almost effortless quality. It looks good in text, rolls off the tongue naturally, and carries a sense of purpose — all hallmarks of a well-crafted name (and a clear sign that naming experts were involved).</p>

<p>Visually, the new logo and concept behind it is a massive leap forward. The logomark is simple yet effective, forming an “M” from two converging shapes that symbolize partnership, integration, and the company’s multidisciplinary expertise. The modernist color palette (and I&#8217;m such a sucker for a modernist color palette such as this) — orange-red, burgundy, cream, black, and white — manages to feel both modern and rooted in heritage, keeping continuity while injecting fresh energy. The underlying logo construction grid on display here isn’t just a meaningless, retroactively added design flourish whose sole purpose is to make simple logos seem like Sacred Geometry, mathematical formulas, and teams of scientists were involved in their creation (as oh-so many logo construction grids do) — it’s a thoughtful structural framework that carries through the entire identity, reinforcing a sense of precision and intentionality.</p>

<p>Typographically, the extended sans-serif logotype strikes the perfect balance between technical and humanistic. It’s clean and precise, reinforcing the firm’s architectural expertise, but with just enough warmth in details like the curved “R” leg and the subtly playful curvature of the “S.” Despite my best efforts using <a href="https://www.myfonts.com/pages/whatthefont" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WhatTheFont,</a> <a href="https://www.whatfontis.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WhatFontIs,</a> and <a href="https://www.fontspring.com/matcherator" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fontspring&#8217;s Font Matcherator,</a> I can&#8217;t seem to identify the exact typeface. I initially thought of <a href="https://ultra-kuhl.com/en/telka" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Telka Wide Bold,</a> <a href="https://www.myfonts.com/collections/halogen-font-positype" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Halogen Black,</a> or <a href="https://hungarumlaut.com/typefaces/laslo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Laslo Wide,</a> but none feature that curved-leg-R (which might very well be a customized element), and the 90º terminals on the &#8220;S&#8221; in &#8220;Merus,&#8221; the &#8220;C&#8221; in &#8220;Since,&#8221; and the &#8220;1&#8221; and &#8220;9&#8221; in &#8220;1894&#8221; suggest otherwise. The foot on the “1” in 1894 is a distinctive touch, reinforcing the numerals’ technical feel. If anyone can identify this font, please do so in the comments.</p>

<p>Anyway, this isn’t just a name change or a cosmetic update — it’s a brand that now fully aligns with the company it represents. The rebrand signals growth, confidence, and evolution, without abandoning the foundation it was built on. A rare case of a redesign that feels like it was always meant to be.</p>

<blockquote>
During a brand positioning workshop, we learned that what Al. Neyer’s clients like best about working with them is that in addition to being collaborative and extremely detail-oriented, they are deeply empathetic: they embrace their clients needs as their own, get to know them as people, and proactively think about solutions without ever pushing. These are really smart and driven people, but they’re also kind and warm. In contrast, the look and tone of their brand and website felt templated, cold, and overly-industrial.
<br /><br />
We created a new brand positioning and personality that captured their true character, and delivered simple instructions on tonal shifts that the Al. Neyer team was immediately able to put into action.</blockquote>

</figure>

<p>Merus’ brand positioning and personality are all about collaboration, precision, and forward momentum — qualities that feel fully embedded in both the company’s ethos and its identity. The brand voice is intentionally crafted to be human, confident, empathetic, and efficient, striking a balance between professional credibility and approachability (think: clear, plain-spoken language, not corporate jargon soup). The personality, dubbed <em>The Good-Natured Leader,</em> reinforces this ethos, embodying the company’s long-held values of partnership, excellence, and adaptability. The repositioning also signals a tonal shift — from corporate to human, self-focused to empathetic, cold to approachable. Even the structural elements of the identity reinforce these ideas: the logomark is literally built from two distinct forms coming together, while the underlying grid system acts as both a design framework and a metaphor for precision, balance, and integration. The result is a brand that doesn’t just say it values collaboration — it shows it at every touchpoint.</p>

<blockquote>
A rebrand is a big change. You need to bring leadership along for the journey to ensure you have buy-in. Employees need to understand why it’s happening and be equipped with language and rationale to explain the change to others. Important clients and partners need to know what’s happening before the brand goes live to the public. You have to inform, reassure, and excite every critical audience, and you have to be very thoughtful in how you go about it.
<br /><br />
We worked with the Merus team to develop a brand launch strategy and campaign, creating messaging, talking points, brand artifacts, touch points, and timelines for leadership, employees, key external stakeholders, and the public.</blockquote>

<p>The primary typeface on display throughout the Merus brand is <a href="https://bureaubrut.com/en/product/brut-grotesque/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Brut Grotesque,</a> a workhorse neo-grotesque chosen for both its modernist pedigree and its practical efficiency. Designed by <a href="https://bureaubrut.com/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bureau Brut,</a> Brut Grotesque takes inspiration from the “bland” aesthetic of Helvetica and Arial, while nodding to type classics like Akzidenz-Grotesk, Folio, and Neue Haas Grotesk. But don’t let the word “bland” fool you — this typeface thrives on neutrality, allowing the brand’s ideas (and structures) to take center stage. Bureau Brut describes it as a typeface that will “never let you down,” and in the context of Merus, that reliability is a perfect fit. The branding doesn’t rely on typographic flourishes or personality-packed letterforms — Brut Grotesque is here to do a job, and it does it with quiet confidence, reinforcing Merus’ balance of technical precision and practical functionality.</p>

<p>That same philosophy carries over into the design of the internal rebrand rollout materials—including the teaser booklet, rebrand launch binder, business cards, folder, and new employee welcome kit. These materials are refreshingly free of gratuitous decoration, focusing instead on clean layouts, strong typography, and the power of white space. The gridlines — a foundational design element of the brand — are thoughtfully integrated but not overused. A standout example is the folder cover, where the debossed gridlines subtly create a structured backdrop for the foil-stamped logo, reinforcing the brand’s architectural precision without feeling heavy-handed. The entire system is a masterclass in “less is more,” proving that when a brand’s foundation is strong, it doesn’t need embellishment to make an impact.</p>

<p>Used across Merus&#8217; construction banners and OOH advertising, the gridlines aren’t just a design embellishment; they serve a functional role, reinforcing the brand’s structured, technical nature while acting as a framing system for juxtaposed messaging. The identity’s core concept of convergence is fully realized in these applications, with pairings like “Design-Build” opposite “Development” and “Architecture” opposite “Investments,” visually reinforcing Merus’ multidisciplinary expertise. This approach transforms what could have been generic corporate signage into an intelligent expression of the brand.</p>

Keeping with the empathetic brand positioning strategy, the new Merus website needed an overhaul to serve its audiences better. It needed to tell a clearer story about Merus’ business structure and offerings, create an inroad for subcontractors, and make it easy for the comms team to update the site and create case studies with less content.
<br /><br />
We developed a new site powered by the user-friendly Craft CMS, and updated the information architecture, content strategy, and page nomenclature to help audiences find what they’re looking for. New CTAs and a contact form specifically for subcontractors work with—and explain Merus’—subcontractor workflow. We also designed a flexible case study template to accommodate different photo sizes and scale up or down for quick or in-depth case studies.</blockquote>

<p>The updated Merus website is a seamless extension of the brand — precise, structured, and refreshingly unfussy. The animated hero section sets the tone immediately, bringing the brand’s modular, grid-driven design system to life, while the animated footer section (with enormous, on-trend logo) echoes that same energy, ensuring the site feels cohesive from top to bottom. The color system provides excellent contrast, allowing key content to stand out while maintaining a sense of balance and refinement. Navigation is clean and intuitive, with a strong hierarchy and visual flow that makes it easy to digest complex information without feeling overwhelming. And there’s no unnecessary ornamentation — just a confident, well-executed digital presence that reflects Merus’ expertise and clarity of vision.</p>

<p>The Merus swag lineup is exactly what you’d expect from a brand such as this — straightforward, and, for the most part, not trying to reinvent the wheel. Most of this falls squarely in “logo on stuff” territory, which is fine because it aligns with the brand’s practical, no-nonsense approach. A standout exception is the split enamel pin — a clever play on the duality of logomark that, but, let’s be honest, will probably never see the light of day beyond a mockup. The real gem (also, most likely only a mockup) is the nameplate with its wooden holder, a sweet 3D extrusion of the “M” logomark that subtly reinforces the brand’s structured, architectural nature.</p>

<blockquote>
Two of the most impactful touchpoints of the pre-launch campaign included a suite of stakeholder gifts featuring the new branding along with a letter announcing and explaining the name change; and an internal brand launch event that featured a brand reveal video, new swag, and brand positioning collateral to introduce, document, and make actionable the new Merus personality.</blockquote>

<p>Merus’ brand rollout wasn’t just about slapping a new logo on a website and calling it a day — it was an orchestrated unveiling that made sure employees, investors, and stakeholders felt invested in the change. The launch event swag, including branded hard hats, quarter-zips, and Heritage-branded ball caps, leaned into the company’s practical, no-frills identity while reinforcing a sense of team unity. One of the investor/stakeholder gifts — a custom-branded bottle of bourbon — was a refined nod to the company’s 130-year heritage, pairing well with the message of longevity and craftsmanship. And then there’s the brand reveal video, which smartly bridged the past and present, explaining the rationale behind the name change, showcasing the brand’s new identity, and making it clear that this was an evolution, not an erasure. It’s one thing to roll out a new name and logo; it’s another to make people care about it, and Merus nailed that balance.</p>

<p class="end">In the end, the Merus rebrand is a rare example of a corporate identity overhaul that actually feels meaningful. Every element — from the name and logomark to the structured layouts, website hierarchy, and architectural use of the grid — reinforces the company’s positioning as a precise, multidisciplinary, and employee-driven organization. This isn’t just branding for the sake of branding; it’s branding that builds something. And while so many corporate redesigns meander through vague themes and arbitrary design rationales, Merus makes its intentions crystal clear. The brand’s gridlines, typography, and structured framework all lead to a sharp, singular conclusion — everything comes together, everything converges, everything comes to a point. And that’s exactly the point.</p>
