                                            <p><strong>Opinion</strong><br />
                                            The old logo was not horrendous but I would say it was fairly bad with its cell-signal-bars icon and half-of-the-corners-rounded sans serif wordmark. It looked cheap and not very trustworthy. The new logo is better by comparison but it's almost too presumptuous in its status in the world of telcos and its ability to adopt such a minimalist identity where its name is so strong and has so much equity that all it needs is a deadpan sans serif wordmark and a green dot to represent it. I mean, kudos for taking that leap of faith-slash-confidence and, to a certain degree, it works in conveying their own perceived level of confidence and market dominance but, at the same time, it's a fairly vacuous logo without much of a story to tell to the point where it ends up feeling like a knock-off brand. This may all sound (and actually be) a little harsh and unfair given that, in the end, it's a decent logo.<span></span> The identity doesn't offer that much more in terms of concept, story, or reason to cheer for the company. It's kind of everything and nothing at the same time. Polished and presentable but also looking like a template waiting for something more visually meaningful or interesting to be replaced with the placeholder elements. You might look at this and think “Hey, it's not bad” and, indeed, it's not bad at all but “Not bad at all” isn't a high bar to clear these days if you follow just the right trends as this identity does, from the deadpan sans serif to the minimalist layouts to the Brat green to the hard flash photography. The one cool thing in all of this is the icon set but that's because it looks like it belongs in another project altogether, one where someone is having a little more fun. Overall, this is a perfectly serviceable identity that looks professional and that choosing Telgea will be a good cost-saving solution (and maybe that's more than enough) but it's devoid of any kind of human emotion or reason to actually care about it.</p>

<p style="margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;"><a href="https://www.instagram.com/apolo.casa/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Apolo</a> is an interior design store in San Pedro Garza García, Nuevo León (near Monterey in Mexico) offering a curated selection of objects and furniture and named after the Greek God, Apollo, who is the deity for many things, including but not limited to healing, archery, music and arts, light, knowledge, truth and prophecy, healing and diseases, light, poetry, and more. By “more” I mean he was also the Greek god of the sun, so, yeah, a big deal. The identity, designed by Guadalajara, Mexico-based <a href="https://www.behance.net/monotypobydanielb" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Monotypo Studio</a>, goes for a Mid-Century aesthetic with a sprinkling of <em>Clockwork Orange</em> for a groovy, space-age-y visual language led by a wordmark and matching typeface with a dramatic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse-contrast_typefaces" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reverse stress</a>. Accompanied by a <a href="https://www.google.com/search?sca_esv=54fcc75b4f72cd60&#038;sxsrf=AHTn8zoQenceY0Q0pQSxqbm_7oPT8FIljw:1739490523413&#038;q=alexander+girard&#038;udm=2&#038;fbs=ABzOT_CWdhQLP1FcmU5B0fn3xuWpA-dk4wpBWOGsoR7DG5zJBsxayPSIAqObp_AgjkUGqemmTG2DFZE7tmKcXVp5H8R-V4YHYjALBdV_9Tsa56rtMh_Al2UzM32Gjxz67FlJtxmknd9AbsZ4JqwdznTAANfptaWHRmkgy9IjGiV14HPq-iVxJm8mlgk22zjP_ssk8P-EvCwGDgBwkmtyJx2GtJPqlSAHiQ&#038;sa=X&#038;ved=2ahUKEwiP3POV68GLAxUMrYkEHeOmCsEQtKgLegQIJxAB&#038;biw=1532&#038;bih=813&#038;dpr=2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Girard-esque</a> sun icon and a handful of Sun God illustrations, the identity is drenched in an optimistic orange that becomes the sole color of the identity, which even spills into <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DFN7eTuSssJ/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the floors, walls, and ceilings of the store</a>. <span class="pagination_divider"></span><span class="small_caps"><a href="https://www.behance.net/gallery/216677107/Apolo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">See full project</a></span></p>

<h1 class="friday_likes">Moodly by The Woork</h1>
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/friday_likes_moodly.jpg" alt="Moodly by The Woork" />

<p style="margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;"><a href="https://moodly.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Moodly</a> is a brand of high-performance natural products using CBD and nootropics that focus on enhancing four different lifestyle aspects: Beauty, balance, calm, and readiness. The packaging, designed by Madrid, Spain-based <a href="https://thewoork.eu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Woork</a>, introduces a quartet of shapes that can be modularly expanded horizontally or vertically to create bigger patterns and compositions that can then serve as backgrounds or holding shapes for typography. The resulting compositions on the boxes, bottles, and tubes, make the products feel science-y and appear like they are going to get the job done affecting those moods in a positive way. Can one fill a bathtub of the Calm oil and soak in it for hours? Asking for a friend.<span class="pagination_divider"></span><span class="small_caps"><a href="https://thewoork.eu/project/moodly" target="_blank" rel="noopener">See full project</a></span>

<h1 class="friday_likes">Volta by Toormix</h1>
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/friday_likes_volta.jpg" alt="Volta by Toormix" />

<p style="margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:30px!important;"><a href="https://www.miirohotels.com/hotelborneta/eat-and-drink" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Volta</a> is a bar and restaurant serving Mediterranean fare as part of Hotel Borneta in Barcelona, Spain. The identity, designed by local firm <a href="https://toormix.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Toormix</a>, takes a strong cue <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DAq9c73IX45/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">from the arches that front the hotel&#8217;s building</a> and effortlessly typesets the short name — which, the restaurant&#8217;s website explains “takes its name from the word for an architectural curve” — into an arch shape. Certainly this treatment isn&#8217;t new but with only five letters in the name, there is a very pleasant symmetry to the logo which also allows the “L” to show up perfectly straight. The identity is fairly straightforward but the boldness and simplicity of the mark, along with the rich green color across the various applications — from menus to coasters to rugs — is very well suited for this chill-yet-elegant restaurant and hotel. <span class="pagination_divider"></span><span class="small_caps"><a href="https://toormix.com/en/project/volta" target="_blank" rel="noopener">See full project</a></span></p>

                                            <p><strong>Relevant quote</strong><br /><em>After holding focus groups with current V&amp;A employees and volunteers, ‘being a part of something more purposeful’ was a consistent theme that people mentioned when asked why they apply – and why they stay.<br /><br />The need to articulate the V&amp;A’s unique culture and values between the museum and its people has never been more important. Building on the V&amp;A’s existing Employee Value Proposition ‘Together, we make it V&amp;A’ Wonderhood Design looked to bring the proposition to life by putting the staff at heart of the identity and creating a simple, bold graphic device that would link such a diverse range of roles together.<br /><br />A graphic ribbon runs over, behind and through imagery of employees and volunteers, and weaves in and out of different spaces and locations, but all connected by the line ‘Together, we make it V&amp;A’.<br /><br />A key part of the identity toolkit was a bespoke animation generator that enables the V&amp;A team to create their own custom animations in almost limitless variations and creating more longevity and ownership of the identity. The visual identity will roll out across the V&amp;A’s print and digital recruitment, website, event dressing, social media and staff collateral.<br /><br />The visual identity was created by Wonderhood Design and shot by photographer Jessica Eliza Ross and features employees and volunteers at the V&amp;A South Kensington and V&amp;A East across two days, capturing a candid day in the life of the museum and its staff and a look behind the scenes of what it’s like to work at this unique organisation.

                                            <p><strong>Opinion</strong><br />
                                            Projects like this one, to me, are some of the most difficult briefs to solve… when an internal and/or external initiative needs its own identity to function separate from the main identity so as to not create public confusion but that it still needs to retain the DNA of the main identity so that the two feel related. It's about finding an interesting way to sort of twist and adapt existing brand assets and equity into something different but the same. But different. But — you surely get where I'm going with this — the same. In this case, as an outsider that is aware of V&amp;A's brand and legacy but not intimately familiar with how it shows up on the daily, there are three core elements that I understand make a jump from the parent brand to this employment initiative: The famous V&amp;A logo, naturally; the organization's proprietary typeface, <a href="https://commercialtype.com/custom/spiller_for_the_v_and_a" target="_blank">Spiller</a>; and the existing Employee Value Proposition of “Together, we make it V&amp;A”.<span></span> From there, the identity's main graphic element is what Wonderhood Design is describing as a “ribbon”, which, I don't want to get too hung up on semantics but that is not very ribbon-y, which is fine, it doesn't have to be. In fact, given the resulting angular, non-twisting shapes of the <em>ribbon</em> I might have been more satisfied if they had taken tight crops of the logo's “V”, ampersand, and “A” to generate the thick strokes and create a more innate connection to the organization. Also, more than weaving like a ribbon, the compositions feel tangled, which, again is fine… just the description doesn't match with what's happening in the applications. The main message of “Together” does come across, which is, ultimately, what matters. <span></span> The color palette, in a range of pastels and a couple of brighter pops looks pretty good when used in graphic-only compositions but I feel like it competes with the photography or, maybe the other way around… the color photography clashes a bit with the colors and I wonder if a monotone or duotone approach would have been better suited. The “Together, we make it V&amp;A” tagline placed inside the strokes is fine for the most part but at times it feels too tight with not enough breathing room and the instances where it's curved gets a little too playful. Overall, this may have been over-rationalized (or properly rationalized just not evidently connected to what's on screen) but, in the end, this has a good attractive energy to it that makes the V&amp;A look like a swell place to work at.</p>

Formed in 2017, Ian Beato and Julian Sacheli chose a name that &#8220;satirizes the notion that artist have to ‘fit in’ to certain sub genres and gimmicks&#8221;. Since then, Black V Neck has made a name for themselves in electronic dance music by, <a href="https://edm.com/features/black-v-neck-retail-records" target="_blank" rel="noopener">as edm.com shares</a>, “weaving their Cuban heritage into their tracks” that “represents a melange of cultural richness and sonic innovation”.

<blockquote>
Born from the underground pulse of Miami’s club scene, BVN emerges—a rebrand from Black V Neck, now stripped to its essence, refined yet raw. This identity isn’t just a look; it’s a rhythm, a movement, a constant merge—like basslines colliding, synths folding into each other, beats locking into grooves.

<p>The old logo was a fair attempt at making a symmetrical logo, but it wasn&#8217;t meant to be. The central &#8220;V&#8221; overpowers the &#8220;BLACK&#8221; and &#8220;NECK&#8221; to either side, and I could see how it might be misread as &#8220;V BLACK NECK&#8221;. An unfortunate result of the forced symmetry meant that the &#8220;BLACK&#8221; lettering needed to be compressed and the &#8220;NECK&#8221; lettering extended. This pairing leads to an odd mismatch that feels worse the longer you look at it. Specifically, the matching pairs of &#8220;CK&#8221;. And, the particular choice of sans serif typeface also exacerbates the inconsistent feeling with its odd blend of sharp and rounded points. Put together, it feels like a hollow attempt at a generic performance brand, something along the lines of vacuum cleaners, golf clubs, or athletic undershirts.</p>

<p>Thankfully, we don&#8217;t need to keep talking about the old logo, because the new logo comes in strong. First off, it feels like music. The new &#8220;BVN&#8221; lettering offers a concise tight wordmark. The logo is now rendered in an italic liquid lettering that allows the individual letters to feel hydrophilic, connecting rather than overlapping. I love everything about this rendering except for one small quibble. On the joint between the two bowls of the &#8220;B&#8221;, the top bowl feels too straight. Regardless, the overall read is far more interesting, active and impactful.</p>

<p>The logo animation then turns the liquid letters into a sticky beat. Each letter hits and falls creating a nicely mesmeric animation.</p>

<blockquote>
Every element leans into the next, a seamless fusion, a hypnotic repetition, just like the driving rhythm of a club track at peak hour. BVN isn’t just a name change. It’s a visual echo of the sound itself—alive, pulsing, and always merging.

</figure>

<p>The typography keeps the beat going with two morphing fonts that change between a simple italic sans serif and a rounded sans serif. Both typefaces have some pleasant moments. I particularly like the &#8220;Q&#8221;, &#8220;J&#8221; and the entire numerals. While the alphabet is well made, I think the best part about the typeface is that is serves as a strong bridge from the old identity to the new. Since BVN will need to be written out periodically, this typeface feels like a youthful child of the former identity.</p>

<p>The icons bring forward two more pieces that put motion into the identity: the spinning peace handsign and [what I can only describe as] walking sunglasses. While I don&#8217;t really know what to call them, I quite like them. The movements, particularly with the walking sunglasses, connect to shapes that are similar to the counters in the logo. And, it captures the confidence of two men in Speedos in Miami Beach.</p>

<p>The photography is a collection of single image photography. The straight-on point of view also simplifies each image and  allows the limited color palette to pop. The red, green and yellow work really well against black and white.</p>

<p>The Instagram posts and stories bring together all the elements into some really interesting compositions. I always love when the whole is greater than the sum of the parts, and I see that here. Limited colors, a few shapes and some simple effects create a really nice collection of posts. A simple system that can easily be expanded. While they might not take your breath away, they are solid. And, notably, each is built from the same set of parts.</p>

<p>While sufficient, the posters are simultaneously the most direct and least exciting part for me. As we move from a digital to print format, the compositions also change. Instead of isolated photography mixed with overly excited motion that bleeds off the edge, now text and images start to feel like generic music posts with center-aligned compositions. The posters are simple, straight forward and well made. They just don&#8217;t capture the &#8220;constant merge—like basslines colliding, synths folding into each other, beats locking into grooves&#8221; that was described earlier.</p>

<p>The large scale digital graphics bring us back to the best of the identity, something that feels big. Here we see a return of edge-to-edge visuals that fill the screen and vibrate with excitement. This is also where I think some smart copywriting could provide a voice to the identity, but overall these hit all the right notes.</p>

<figcaption>Merchandise.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The merch is also pretty direct and to the point. I do like how the the &#8220;BVN&#8221; is rendered on the back of the shirt. However, I would also love to see something that feels more Miami-inspired here.</p>

<p class="end">In the best way possible, the redesign takes us from zero to nine. BVN now looks like house music. What I like is that it has accomplished this without feeling overdone or over-touched. It is intentionally loose, which feels right for this project and means that the designer knew what they were doing. Certainly there are a few things that can be developed further. The good news is, there will be opportunities for the redesign to find its rhythm as the shift from Black V Neck to BVN continues to take form.</p>
