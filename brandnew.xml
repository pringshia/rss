                                            <p><strong>Relevant quote</strong><br /><em>After a competitive pitching process, Upwork appointed NOT Wieden+Kennedy to evolve its visual identity. The goal of the project was to enhance global brand awareness and differentiation through a more cohesive and consistent brand and product experience for its customers, where everything - from social posts to the click of ‘project completion’ in the product - would feel uniquely Upwork.<br /><br />‘A new dimension of work’ is the concept at the heart of Upwork’s refreshed visual identity. This concept reflects a world where work works for everyone—where companies gain agility through access to top talent and ideas globally, and where work fits into people’s lives, rather than the other way around. <br /><br />To capture this vision, the new visual identity is sleek, minimalist, and purposefully designed to convey a constant sense of forward momentum and growth. This is done through a new typographic system with dimensional treatments, created with a purpose-built fluid grid system that allows endless permutations of shape and image - appropriately embodying the flexibility of the future of work.<br /><br />The visual update strengthens cohesion across customer touchpoints by refining the brand colours. The palette has been streamlined to increase brand awareness and create a more unified experience while adding depth and dynamism that differentiates Upwork from its competitors. Touches of glimmer have also been added for additional invigoration and energy.<br /><br />To reflect a world of work that never stands still, motion behaviours are also present throughout the new visual identity. The grid system animates to react to content and messaging, and the typography creates a sense of looking into the future. Meanwhile, the colour is now on a gradient rather than a static colour, so that it’s always in motion itself.

                                            <p><strong>Opinion</strong><br />
                                            The previous identity, <a href="https://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/new_logo_and_identity_for_upwork_by_porto_rocha.php" target="_blank">designed by PORTO ROCHA three years ago</a>, was a significant maturation point — visually speaking — for Upwork as it finessed its logo and built a warm and friendly visual language and tone of voice through some charming illustrations, soft focus photography, and a slightly rounded serif to complement a deadpan sans serif. This new identity goes for a more edgy and less warm-and-fuzzy vibe as it abandons the illustrations, the serif, and the secondary colors that helped soften the green and black combo. (Acknowledgment: The website still features some spot illustrations but it's hard to tell where the website lands in the time-space continuum of the identity evolution as not much of the new stuff here is evident there.)<span></span> Now, the deadpan-est of deadpan sans serifs, <a href="https://pangrampangram.com/products/neue-montreal" target="_blank">Neue Montreal</a>, becomes the center of attention as it brings to life the new brand idea of “A new dimension of work” as it skews, tilts, and scales in angular, jerky movements to deliver a more confident (perhaps even a little <em>over</em>-confident) tone of voice with bolder proclamations. Despite one of the headlines being “Grow teams, not cubicle farms”, the identity is almost literally compartmentalizing as it introduces a boxy, interlocking, grid of holding shapes that split and divide imagery and messaging, giving layouts a boxy, cubicle-esque feeling. It also almost looks like floor plans making it feel like a real estate brand. The ooze-y green gradients are odd and don't add much to the identity, other than some additional visual noise. Nothing here is necessarily wrong but nothing is particularly clicking either. Overall, this feels like an attempt at making Upwork feel younger, hipper, edgier, and more dynamic, which, in a way, it does but it's also now more generic and hard to tell what kind of talent it's trying to attract and what kind of companies it's trying to connect with.</p>

<blockquote>Mayda’s name is derived from a mythical isle that mysteriously appeared on maps at various points throughout history. Many have searched for it but few have ever found it. The metaphor of stepping into the unknown to search a distant horizon for an intangible destination, is at the heart of Mayda’s creative process. Our identity builds on that metaphor and puts the perspective point of the horizon at the heart of the brand.</blockquote><h3><a href="https://www.studio-kiln.com/project/mayda" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Studio Kiln project page</a></h3>

<p>The old logo was not good. Conceptually, it&#8217;s hard to tell what they were going for with the drifting of the baseline — maybe “going with the current”? — and execution-wise, those were some uncomfortable transitions from straight into curved beziers on letters that were simply not meant to extend and bend like that. The new logo is drastically better not just by comparison but also by its own merits of interpreting the “Y” in a completely novel way for a very unique wordmark. I love how the “M” and “A”s support and complement the construction of the “Y” by having the same super thin, barely-touching gesture at the point of intersection in their angled strokes. The “Y” then becomes the primary graphic device in the identity and while this could be problematic with it being the third letter in the name of the company and taking the job away from the “M”, it&#8217;s such an abstract design that it doesn&#8217;t feel as awkward as it could be to make it the hero.</p>

<blockquote>With the best talent, the brightest ideas and the newest technology, Mayda is always looking to tomorrow, propelling us to something just out of reach. We communicate this by expanding the central Y of the logo into a dynamic portal that leads us into the creative unknown. From energetic adverts to pioneering products, the portal adjusts and reconfigures to guide us through the unique creative destinations that the team arrive at.</blockquote><h3><a href="https://www.studio-kiln.com/project/mayda" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Studio Kiln project page</a></h3>

<p>It also helps that the motion behaviors of the “Y” are slick and exciting, whether it&#8217;s animating within the wordmark or expanding into the “portal” in a kind of kaleidoscopic approach, spinning and zooming to interact with imagery and footage behind and inside it.</p>

<p>The identity elements are relatively simple: Lots of <a href="https://www.weltkern.com/shop/detail-typeface/everett" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Everett</a> and <a href="https://www.weltkern.com/shop/detail-typeface/everett-mono" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Everett Mono</a> in small, medium, and big sizes; some funky wavy backgrounds; the portal motif; and the wide range of imagery, animation, and live footage Mayda has produced over the years. Nothing particularly original or earth-shattering in the elements but they all work cohesively together and allow the individual directors and the combined projects to stand out.</p>

<blockquote>Exploring the horizon line is a theme that continues to play an important role in the design and navigation of the website. Horizontal divisions combined with the use of depth and perspective create the feeling that the user is pushing forever further into Mayda’s world.</blockquote><h3><a href="https://www.studio-kiln.com/project/mayda" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Studio Kiln project page</a></h3>

<p class="end">Overall this strikes a good balance that many creative agencies struggle with as they either employ little to no design where it becomes impossible to tell they are actually creative or they go completely bananas and overboard with their own identities where it becomes impossible to appreciate their work or navigate their websites. This sits comfortably and confidently somewhere in between.</p>

                                            <p>Last week, the <a href="https://www.aee.gob.es/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Agencia Espacial Española</a> (“Spanish Space Agency”) introduced a new logo designed by <a href="https://mywayspain.es/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MyWay Spain</a>. For fear of pointing out the obvious, it&#8217;s not good but that&#8217;s the least interesting part about this. Turns out that in 2022 and into 2023, the Space agency, through Spain&#8217;s Ministry of Science and Innovation and the <a href="https://designread.es/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Spanish Network of Design Associations</a>, went through an RFP and pitch that attracted 75 proposals with three of them being asked to deliver a paid design pitch. From those three, a winning proposal by <a href="https://www.instagram.com/cruzmascruz/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cruz más Cruz</a> and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/rubioydelamo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rubio &#038; del Amo</a> was selected and work began on the project until it came to a halt in 2023. Then in September of 2024, the Cruz más Cruz and Rubio &#038; del Amo team were told by the Space Agency they would soon be discussing next steps on the project only to be told a few weeks later and three days before the unveiling that they were not going to use their logo as the agency had contracted someone else. You can see a video of the proposed identity <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FsnvEZiHHbE" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a> and a video of the official logo <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwEymG6jhlM" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>. Such a shame.

                                            <p><strong>Relevant quote</strong><br /><em>Full Pin is a gourmet mushroom farm founded by two former engineers. They grow 10 varieties of world-class mushrooms in their Montréal facility, which feels more like a high-tech racing garage than a traditional farm. Their quest for speed and repeatable perfection has earned them the respect of the city’s most prestigious restaurants, who rely on Full Pin every day.<br /><br />Full Pin needed a visual identity that reflected their unique approach.<br /><br />Inspired by their name – a Quebecois expression meaning ‘full speed’ – we transformed Full Pin’s identity to embody the boldness and bravado of a motorsports team. From a custom logo and set of icons that would look right at home on a pit crew, to sharp photography and race-ready merch. And with plans to break into supermarkets, we took Full Pin from a chef’s secret weapon to a champion on the shelf.

                                            The old logo had a good idea and perhaps with a better and more integrated execution of the mushroom's cap with the typography, it could have been pretty great. Without the “Urban Mushroom Farm” descriptor on the top, it might have been hard to know what the logo was for but once you knew what Full Pin was about, it instantly read as a mushroom. The new logo drops the descriptor and the only subtle indication that this is about mushrooms is in the tittle of the “i”, which is kind of clever but easy to miss for anyone seeing the logo out in the world on its own, which, in its defense it will rarely happen, as this is a hyper local B2B brand so most people will know that this is about mushrooms.<span></span> Making the logo (and identity) look like a motorsports team is a little odd at first, when one thinks of mushrooms as being earthy, organic, and grown in soil but seeing their facility, it definitely gives high-tech, high-performance vibes so I'm happy to get on board with the race car look, especially since it's so well done and since it yields such an unexpected typographic solution. The crossbars of the “F” and “P” add a fun, speedy flair while also interlocking perfectly in monogram form and the “i” definitely brings a smile to my face.<span></span> The almost That Blue color may be pushing this too far out of food territory but, seeing one of Full Pin's founders wearing the blue cap inside their mushroom humidor, certainly makes a good case for the color choice as the blue stands out from the product and the environment. Also, the pit crew overalls are fire. In the case of the retail packaging, the blue once again really stands out as it wraps around the earthy-colored mushrooms and containers. The few applications shown are bold and engaging, continuing the racing aesthetic but I wonder if it will quickly turn into a gimmick that only works on a short run and whether the photography — which is fantastic — actually pairs well with it.

København</a> (Football Club Copenhagen) or FCK for short is, as the name suggests, a professional football club based in Copenhagen, Denmark. While the club itself was founded in 1992, it was formed as a parent organization for some of the oldest sports clubs in continental Europe when <a href="https://www.b1903.dk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Boldklubben 1903</a> (The Ball Club 1903, founded 1903) and <a href="http://www.kb-boldklub.dk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kjøbenhavns Boldklub</a> (Copenhagen Football Club, founded 1876) joined forces. The club boasts a record 15 Danish Superliga championships and 9 Danish Cup wins, after the 2022–23 season saw them win both titles. A new visual identity for the club was unveiled in July 2024 and designed by the Copenhagen, Denmark-based office of <a href="https://www.kontrapunkt.dk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kontrapunkt</a>.</p>

F.C. København isn&#8217;t just a football team; it&#8217;s a cultural icon of Copenhagen. It captures the hopes and dreams of an entire city. We&#8217;ve created a brand platform that embodies the club&#8217;s spirit and legacy. From the refinement of the primary logo to the iconic use of the lion, from the symbol-rich emblem and custom typefaces inspired by Copenhagen&#8217;s street signs to a new color palette including colorways for the new women’s team and a new communications concept, every element tells the story of the city — the story of FCK.

<figcaption>Logo, before and after comparison.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>When trying to dig up an SVG of the new logo to make the comparison GIF above, I kept stumbling across &#8220;new&#8221; versions of the logo from unofficial sources that were just the old logo in the new colors. Much like the fans who were bootlegging them, I was entirely unable to distinguish the new and old lions from the thumbnails alone. (Special shout-out to Jonas from Kontrapunkt who submitted this case all the way back in September, and who was kind enough to respond to our last-minute request for an official vector version of the logo yesterday).</p>

<p>It isn&#8217;t until you get very close that you start to see the refinements. A stronger chin, a thicker brow, and a wider eye all give the lion a sturdier overall character. It&#8217;s an extremely subtle improvement, possibly by necessity. Football club logo changes have historically been the source of some of the biggest branding backlashes (see: <a href="https://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/new_logo_for_premier_league_by_designstudio_and_robin_brand_consultants.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Premier League</a> 2016, <a href="https://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/new_logo_and_identity_for_juventus_by_interbrand.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Juventus</a> 2017, <a href="https://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/new_crest_for_leeds_united_fc.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Leeds</a> 2018, etc.) but with tweaks this minor and a rollout strategy so slow that isn&#8217;t slated to be complete until the 2025-26 season, you&#8217;d be hard pressed to find an FCK fan who noticed the logo change at all, let alone one with hurt feelings about it. The updates made here are well within the margins of error of your typical tattoo, so no one is going to wake up tomorrow with a freshly outdated leg.</p>

<p>The wordmark started out as a nondescript condensed sans serif. The refresh keeps the same basic construction and condenses it even further. There&#8217;s been a real effort made to match the type on a path curve better, from big changes like rounding the periods and trimming the stroke of the <em>Ø</em> to small ones like bending the stems of the characters to meet the baseline. It&#8217;s exactly what a logo refinement should be &#8211; it changes nothing and tidies up everything.

<figcaption>Typography.</figcaption>
</figure>


<p>FCK Sans and FCK Serif are custom-made typefaces which carry forward that same condensed type energy into the rest of the identity. The design of the glyphs are informed by the typographical styles found on Copenhagen street signs, giving it that extra bit of local flair that you wanna see your hometown sports team rocking. I&#8217;m a little  obsessed with the solution to the two-story ( 1 &frac12;-story?) lower case <em>g</em> they&#8217;ve found here. The counter is allowed to be as tall and stretched as the rest of the set by just cutting its legs off, which is truly an inspired choice. I love the dramatic thick/thin contrast in FCK Serif as well. It has an extra layer of meta-contrast with the uniform stroke weight of FCK Sans and allows for a fun interplay between the two typefaces. As they say in football, it really covers all the bases.</p>

<p>The crest is a thing of beauty, overwrought but not overcooked. Taking inventory, we&#8217;ve got four Danish flags, two knight helmets, two cannons, two drums, lions in two genders, a crown, a chest plate, the city skyline of Copenhagen, and an assortment of ropes pulling double-duty as border and drapery. Despite being one partridge in a pear tree short of a carol, the whole thing comes together through the magic of consistent spacing, styling, and shading which naturally-occurring crests so often lack. What&#8217;s possibly even more remarkable than how it all looks together is how well it works in pieces &#8211; the icons are compositions all to themselves, making the crest something akin to a functional illustration palette that directs the rest of the visual identity its very heart. I can&#8217;t imagine any industry except European football pulling something like this off, and I&#8217;m so glad to see it realized here.</p>

</figure>

<p>The layouts are peak 2020s sports branding &#8211; big fast type on blocks of color on sports photography. It lacks that extra oomph that <a href="https://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/new_identity_and_on_air_look_for_fox_summer_of_stars_by_thru.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FOX Sport&#8217;s Summer of Stars</a> campaign brought to the genre earlier this year by arranging their big fast type into star shapes, but it is undeniably the same philosophy which results, here, in a competent execution of the same trend.</p>

</figure>

<p>The social and signage applications drop the color blocking for a more subdued look, relying on the type and crest as watermarks over photography. If you&#8217;ve got a brand based around heraldry, you&#8217;ve gotta throw in at least one approach where you&#8217;re using the crest as a stamp. It&#8217;s the rules.</p>

<p>I dig the apparel even if &#8211; as they say in football &#8211; it isn&#8217;t taking any big swings. It&#8217;s just the team iconography on the team colors, but as a result it does look very team. The icon layouts kind of make a return here? I&#8217;m not seeing any of the crest elements broken free of their voltron, but the 1992 designs are of the same vein and it&#8217;s not hard to imagine them making appearances further down the fashion line.</p>

<!-- JAY: for now I commented this out so that I could publish by 7:00 you can remove the exclamation mark and hyphens to make live again and there is two more hyphens at the end of the paragraph p>The one choice where they lose me is the design of the numerals on the uniforms. The sports jersey is a logo for the team unto itself, and in this specific case the digits are custom made. These numbers could not possibly be appearing in a more FCK-owned context, yet they all still have a little lion head on the base, furry little registered trademark symbols, lest you forget who owns that particular <em>2</em>. Frankly, I don't get it, and I had to skim back through quite a bit of the Brand New backlog before I could be sure that this wasn't some European football jersey convention I had somehow missed. But I can now say with 80% confidence that this is just a weird choice Kontrapunkt made with no discernible justification.</p -->

<p class="end">Just looking at the logo, it would be easy to see this campaign as a refresh. Indeed, the DNA of the FCK brand remains intact but what Kontrapunkt has added to the F.C. København landscape is a remarkable illustration system that functions in a truly unique way, a flash sheet of elements that works as an element all its own. Add to that a few excellent typefaces, a very serviceable motion system, and an elegant set of layouts and you&#8217;ve got, as they say in football, a home run.</p>
