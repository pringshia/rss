                                                                    <img src="https://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/wp/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/2025_05_21_Speakers_Announced_BN.png" alt="2025 Brand New Conference: Speakers Announced" />
                                
                                
                                
                                                                                
                                        
                                            
                                            <p>Speakers, details, early-bird registration, and more are all now live for the <a href="http://www.underconsideration.com/brandnewconference" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2025 Brand New Conference</a> in Pittsburgh, PA, on October 23 &ndash; 24.</p>
<p>A few things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Early-bird pricing will end June 27.</li>
<li>Unlike all previous conferences, there will NOT be a live webcast — we will be switching to our post-event remote access model.</li>
<li>If you are considering attending, get your <a href="https://underconsideration.com/brandnewconference/hotels.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hotel</a> sorted ASAP! Prices have gone up quite a bit over the course of 2025.</li>
<li>After a successful 2024 without sponsors, there will be no sponsors in 2025 either.</li>
<li>2024 was also a great first run of <a href="https://underconsideration.com/brandnewconference/the_fan_zone.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Fan Zone!</a> and we will keep iterating on it for 2025.</li>
<li>An explanation of this year&#8217;s steel-beam-inspired identity can be found <a href="http://www.underconsideration.com/brandnewconference/about_the_identity.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</li>
<li>Customized stencil version of Stringer Thin and optical refinement of the glyphs that will make up our hero logo compositions by <a href="https://order.design/otf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Order Type Foundry</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Hope to see many of you there!</p>

Best known for its aphrodisiac chocolates, Tabs comes in squares that are easily split in half (one for each of you and your partner) that delivers a specific vibe through ingredients like maca, L-theanine, and caffeine, turning functional benefits into genuine indulgence. (They contain ZERO illicit drugs or substances.)</p>

Their aphrodisiac bars had generated viral buzz, but the brand leaned too heavily on raunchy innuendos and AI-generated imagery of intimate couples with extra thumbs. The result felt more like a gas station impulse buy than a premium mood-enhancing product.<br /><br />We landed on a simple truth during our explorations: people don't want less of anything good. "More vibes, more feelings, more everything" became our mantra. Why choose between productivity and pleasure when you can have both? We worked towards a brand that could grow beyond bedroom benefits into a full spectrum of emotional states.<br /><br />The visual identity draws unexpected inspiration from vintage cigarette advertisements and matchbooks — that perfect blend of forbidden and familiar. We crafted a lo-fi system that feels both premium and playful, with illustrations that embody the specific mood-boosting properties of each product variant. The imagery is deliberately imperfect, hand-drawn rather than Bezier-curved, capturing the human quality of the emotions Tabs enhances.<br /><br />For the verbal identity, Tabs understands what you need to elevate your day and delivers it with confidence and charm. Inspired by the effortless allure of Lenny Kravitz and the cool edge of Christopher Walken, Tabs strikes the perfect balance between being coveted and approachable.

                                            <p><strong>Opinion</strong><br />
                                            The old logo was typeset in the Latin version of the free <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Laila" target="_blank">Laila</a>, a curvy, swashy, semi-serif that was first designed as a Devanagari script where those curvy, swashy gestures feel more at ease and at home, which is a roundabout way of saying I don't like the old logo as it's quite generic and lacks any kind of distinctive trait. The new logo is all distinctive traits and while I would like to say they are all welcome, I am quite baffled by the italic “t” as I have no idea what conceptual purpose it serves and visually, it's just plain awkward.  The choice of <a href="https://www.frostype.xyz/typeface/lambert" target="_blank">Lambert</a> was actually a great starting point, given its quirky terminals and exaggerated slabs but by using the italic for the “t” it almost looks like it's from another typeface altogether.<span></span> To the logo's credit, it establishes early on a predilection for the weird and a desire to tiptoe on the edgy, best exemplified by the hand-drawn illustrations that are actually quite cool, fun, and quirky on their own but somehow seem like they lost course somewhere and ended up in this project. Then there are the floating 3D packet illustrations that I am also not sure what purpose they serve… at first I thought they were crude mock-ups on purpose but after seeing the real packaging, there is no clear connection between the two and even for case-study purposes, as a means to jeuje it up, it feels at odds with the rest of the aesthetic.<span></span> The real packaging for the new line of tongue tabs is actually kind of cool and where all of the weird, myriad elements perhaps make sense as the illustrations land on top of the repeating type treatments for each mood variation on the front of the pack while, on the top, the type is stretched in any way necessary to make it fit the lid, all as the logo sits there amidst some relatively generous white space.<span></span> The website, advertising, and socials all then beat to their own drum with a mix of condensed and wide <a href="https://mckltype.com/owners/" target="_blank">Owners</a>, all of which is fine to be fair, just on a slightly different wavelength than the packaging. Overall, this is clearly going for an edgy look and trying to shed the Valentine’s-y-red-roses-“sex chocolate” persona it was known for (that led <a href="https://loox.app/happy-customers/tabs#:~:text=%E2%80%8D,t%20your%20ordinary%20chocolate%20company." target="_blank">to tremendous financial success apparently</a>) so it certainly succeeds in that regard but perhaps now it ended up in cannabis brand territory where it can't compete as strongly with no THC to offer.</p>

<p>The previous identity for Kongernes Samling took its main inspiration from the crown of King Christian V, a baroque masterpiece crafted in 1670 for his coronation. It’s one of the most historically significant and visually striking pieces in the Royal Danish Collection — an ornate emblem of monarchy, power, and craftsmanship. The resulting logomark distilled that visual grandeur into a thin, monolinear icon that managed to preserve just enough detail to remain recognizable without feeling fussy.</p>

<p>Overall, it was a strong identity — one that embraced a sort of Modernist Scandinavian Minimalism. The logomark was clean and elegant, paired with a monolinear grotesk logotype that emphasized sleek functionality. That said, the system leaned a bit too heavily on its modularity. The sprawling logo architecture — with a dense thicket of crown-topped institution names, all typeset in modern serif stencils — started to feel overwhelming. And while I liked the stencil serif in isolation, it didn’t feel totally at home next to the core identity’s minimalist aesthetic. Layouts, too, sometimes felt disjointed, with three distinct typefaces jostling for attention layered over photography. But despite those gripes, the overall effect was refined and contemporary — seemingly very much how Kongernes Samling wanted to be positioned at that time. This is one of those cases where the rebrand isn’t solving a design problem so much as it’s setting a new tone.</p>

<p>The new logo simplifies things dramatically — and smartly. By abbreviating “Den Kongelige Samling” to “KGL Samling,” Kontrapunkt introduces a bit of visual shorthand that improves usability while giving the logotype a more commanding presence. The stacked and linear lockups are clean, confident, and regal, thanks in large part to the use of <a href="https://mckltype.com/trust" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trust,</a> a flared serif typeface by <a href="https://mckltype.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MCKL Type Foundry</a> that brings just the right amount of ceremony to the proceedings. It’s a fitting tonal shift, trading the sleek minimalism of the previous identity for something with more historic weight and pageantry.</p>

<p>OK, let&#8217;s talk about the elephant in the throne room: that wild, customized, interlocked “M-L-I” combo — a move that almost dares you not to have an opinion. The “M” and “L” are fused into a custom ligature, with a superscript-style “I” nestled neatly between the “L” and the “N.” I gotta be honest here, I&#8217;ve stared at this thing for hours, and I&#8217;m still vacillating between loving and <em>not-so-much-loving</em> this solution — and I truly wish I wasn’t so Libra sometimes, so I could make an official declaration about how I feel, but… here we are. There’s something about the ligature’s unnatural shape and awkward flow that can make legibility a struggle, especially if you’re unfamiliar with the name. But the more I look at it, the more I <em>think</em> I&#8217;m buying what it&#8217;s selling. It&#8217;s like I&#8217;ve got a devil on one shoulder whispering, &#8220;Don&#8217;t like it, don&#8217;t like it, <em>don&#8217;t you dare like this,</em>&#8221; and an angel on the other whispering, &#8220;Go ahead and like it. It&#8217;s ok.&#8221; It invites a longer look, a slower read — not unlike how one might move through the ornate, artifact-filled halls of these royal institutions. And that little “I,” tucked delicately into its nook, is a typographic flourish that makes me think of some tiny treasure in a velvet-lined display case. Overall, it&#8217;s a treatment that&#8217;s unexpected, a little strange, but… memorable.</p>

<blockquote>
At the heart of the new visual identity are two key elements: the shield and the crown. The shield functions as a marker and flexible frame for imagery, color, and text, while the crown serves as a distinctive symbol of royal heritage. Together, they create a visual language that bridges royal tradition and contemporary life. These graphic elements scale seamlessly from favicon to full layout systems.
<br /><br />
The logotype blends traditional ligatures with contemporary precision, while the color palette is drawn directly from the collection’s own artifacts. Both the visual identity and tone of voice form a sensory treasury, where tactile experiences and language leave physical impressions of history’s resonance.

<p>The core identity system builds beautifully on the logotype with a set of supporting elements that feel both refined and deeply intentional. The crown — now even <em>more</em> simplified — is a marvel of minimalism, somehow managing to shed even more detail while still preserving the silhouette and symbolism of Christian V’s original. It now plays a quieter, secondary role, serving as a small, elegant graphic accent. The introduction of the shield element is a particularly smart move. It adds historical weight and heraldic flair, while also functioning as a dynamic container for both static imagery and video. I especially love how content feels both held by and breaking through the frame, lending the system a sense of dimensionality. The color palette is a study of contrasts, striking a regal balance between heavy, saturated tones (deep olive, forest green, navy, burgundy) and soft, gossamer pastels (sky blue, pale yellow, mint green, and pink). And anchoring it all is the repeated use of <a href="https://mckltype.com/trust" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trust</a> — the brand typeface — whose lighter weights add elegance and cohesion without competing with the boldness of the logo.</p>

<p>The applications are where the restraint of the visual system really shines. With only a handful of core elements — the logotype, the crown, the shield, the Trust typeface, and that lush color palette — the layouts manage to feel sophisticated, considered, and fully dimensional. The shield in particular is put to excellent use across formats: on posters, it acts as both frame and stage, with objects gracefully overlapping or receding behind its shape; on banners, it stretches vertically to accommodate tall imagery, reinforcing its adaptability without breaking form. But it’s the color that truly steals the show — bold when it needs to be, soft when it wants to be, and always working to elevate the layouts. It’s proof that when you have the right ingredients, you don’t need many of them to make something rich and memorable.</p>

<p class="end">The website is a perfect digital embodiment of the brand. It&#8217;s beautifully designed, effortlessly elegant, and a joy to navigate. With generous white space, striking photography and video, and just the right touch of motion, it offers a premium user experience without ever feeling overdesigned. The minimal brand elements maintain structure and hierarchy without getting in the way. And all personal logo ligature wishy-washiness aside, that sizzle reel showcases just how flexible and cohesive this system really is, proving that when every element is doing its job, even a restrained toolkit can feel like a royal treasure trove.</p>

                                            <p><strong>Opinion</strong><br />
                                            The old logo was not particularly interesting or memorable and the vertical line on the left was unnecessary as it didn't seem to serve any conceptual purpose but at least the chosen typeface was kind of fun, if a little wonky. I also kind of liked the old name… there was something charming about the idea of “fresh-cut foods” as a business but I guess it was limiting in contrast to all the things the company did to food that went beyond cutting them. The new name is fine but perhaps a little long and maybe one step removed from food… meaning that a “natural innovation” could be an innovation on anything in nature: sheep, orchids, spiders, rocks, et al but, then again, I have sometimes been faulty of taking things too literal so let's move on.<span></span> The logo introduces an icon that is meant to symbolize “natural growth and future focus” which I guess it does given that it's green, it's shaped like a sideways tree, and it's pointing right so it's hard to argue against it as it's a rather nice drawing too but it also feels somewhat generic and not as relevant or specific to what the company does. The wordmark is fine but it's trying a little too hard with the curved diagonal stroke of the “N” and because there are so many “N”s in so many different places along the long wordmark the curved strokes become rather distracting and stand out amidst the rest of the “normal” letters. Nonetheless, it's an okay, harmless logo.<span></span> Perhaps chosen for its name alone, <a href="https://www.thedesignersfoundry.com/tomato-grotesk" target="_blank">Tomato Grotesk</a> is a good choice for the identity as its accentuated contrast (especially in some of the counterspaces) nicely matches the icon in the logo. The photography is quite good and showcases the journey that food goes through with the company, from raw and unfinished to being processed in heavy machinery to being cooked to being served, all with a juicy, high-contrast sheen that is a couple of degrees less bright (in a good way) than the trendy hard flash style. Not much in actual application, which maybe the company doesn't actually need given its B2B nature and the website does offer everything needed to understand what they do in a clear, crisp, and concise manner but other than the green colors, some rounded corners throughout, and lots of Tomato Grotesk, there is not much else going on. Overall, this is a fairly safe identity and it doesn't take any big swings — not that big swings are always needed but with a name like “Natural Innovations” perhaps one small innovative swing would have been welcome — but that nonetheless manages to convey a methodical, almost scientific approach to treating food ingredients with just enough of a hint that all of this will eventually to a yummy dish somewhere.</p>
