                                            <p><strong>Relevant quote</strong><br /><em>The Orangetheory workout was created to increase metabolic rate and burn more fat. But after spending time with dozens of members, coaches, and employees, we saw the magic of Orangetheory was in helping all fitness levels feel better, for longer. So we refocused the brand’s positioning: Orangetheory is the antidote to today’s expensive, exclusive and exhausting fitness landscape — a brand designed to energize everyone.<br /><br />The Orangetheory brand identity needed to represent and amplify these Pillars. We began with a system of cards, connected by an embedded spark of energy. These cards allow the brand to present the essentials, guide members on their journey, and showcase insight and inspiration.<br /><br />The Orangetheory symbol was used to inspire key assets and create a unified look and feel. We combined the symbol’s curves with sparks of energy to build bespoke frames used to house community content. A new type system and new iconography also reflect the icon’s curves, and brings a warmth and approachability to the system.

                                            <p><strong>Opinion</strong><br />
                                            Other than the clever adoption of orange in the name and branding, making it the clear owner of said color in the fitness center category, I have always found the Orangetheory identity to be… not great. The logo is kind of terrible and their materials were always on the cheesy side. I've never been a member myself but my wife was and we have about a dozen different little towels from them in our house gym… all very wicking but butt-ugly. Anyway… <a href="https://www.orangetheory.com/en-us/our-commitment" target="_blank">if you visit some pages outside of the top-level pages</a> (which are the only ones that have been redesigned) you can get a sense of how ho-hum everything was. I've also included a before/after comparison of the home page because that really puts it in perspective of what a big impact this new identity can have.<span></span> Leading the charge is a signature DesignStudio move of a swirly, groovy, wildly-colored gradient that looks like an aurora borealis at a Phish concert — in other words, what's not to love? Light sarcasm aside, it's actually a cool graphic. A new type system built around <a href="https://pangrampangram.com/products/right-grotesk" target="_blank">Right Grotesk</a>, replaces the outdated <a href="https://processtypefoundry.com/fonts/klavika/" target="_blank">Klavika</a> — <a href="https://fontsinuse.com/uses/5673/facebook-logo" target="_blank">once famous as the Facebook font</a> and was so stiff and cold in its use by OT — for a far more contemporary, engaging, and friendly look. In a bit of a literal stretch, some holding shapes have been extracted from fractions of the silhouette of the icon. To their credit they are cool if perhaps a little bit of a personal, harsh reminder of my own love handles. The “card” system with the “embedded spark of energy” in the negative space between is also interesting and works great to establish a relatively unique layout system.<span></span> The tone of voice is solid too, with bold and encouraging claims but never getting too cringey or overly motivational where it becomes annoying or preachy. Overall, this has a lot of moving parts, not all quite well related to each other but that manage to come together in an energetic, slightly chaotic way, which is actually quite in tune with the OT workout experience.</p>

The team plays their home games at the massive Cotton Bowl, a municipally-owned stadium  with a 92,000 capacity, located in the Fair Park neighborhood of Dallas, Texas. With the first half of the inaugural season concluding recently, Trinity stands in 2nd place with 6 wins, 3 losses, and 5 ties.

<blockquote>Since the 1930s, a red neon Pegasus has illuminated downtown Dallas from atop the 29-story Magnolia Petroleum Building, standing as a steadfast symbol of the city’s progress, pride, and persistence. We reimagined this iconic figure from Greek mythology in our crest, tying the team’s identity to the rich history of Dallas. This enduring symbol embodies the city’s unyielding spirit—whether you call it grit, entrepreneurial drive, or plain stubbornness, there’s simply no quit in Dallas.</blockquote><h3><a href="https://monikersf.com/project/dallastrinityfc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Moniker project page</a></h3>

<p>I&#8217;m not going to spend too much time on the logo today <a href="https://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/new_logo_and_identity_for_dallas_trinity_fc_by_modestworks_and_moniker.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">as I already wrote plenty about it in May</a> and the polls and comments have spoken: It&#8217;s GREAT. The icon is just beautifully done, the typography around it is great (now we know where it comes from too… see below), and the gold and maroon color palette is to die for.</p>

<blockquote>To bring the visual identity to life, we drew inspiration from the team’s inaugural home: the historic Cotton Bowl. Located in Fair Park just east of downtown, the stadium is surrounded by one of the world’s finest collections of art deco architecture. Custom typefaces were designed to echo the bold, timeless forms of the words and letters etched into stone across Fair Park’s iconic buildings.</blockquote><h3><a href="https://www.modestworks.com/works/dallas-trinity-fc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ModestWorks project page</a></h3>

<figcaption>Trinity Flare.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Taking inspiration from the inscriptions of the various buildings that make up Dallas&#8217; Fair Park — a 277-acre cultural and entertainment district constructed in 1936 with a National Historic Landmark designation with the largest collection of 1930s Art Deco exposition style architecture in the United States — two custom typefaces have been created for the team. One is an excellent flared serif with a high-waisted structure that gives some characters like the “A”, “M”, and “R” a contemporary edge that looks great against the more classic aesthetic of its chiseled origins. The lowercase is a bit funky, in both good and bad ways… something about the tiny ascenders and descenders in contrast to the very wide, circular bowls of the letters is a little off but, still, it&#8217;s remarkably good. Naturally, the numerals rule.</p>

<p>The bold, high-contrast, condensed sans serif is also great and a wonderful companion to the flared style. The lowercase looks much better here and despite my reaction at the ascender/descender ratio on the flare, I do really like how the two typefaces share the same proportions. Also, and this may be an odd compliment, I appreciate the restraint and self-limitation of using a single weight and width of each typeface — I love me a variable font as much as anyone else but, at times, they provide TOO much flexibility.</p>

<p>Supported by a condensed monospace, <a href="https://playtype.com/typefaces/italian-plate-no2-mono/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Italian Plate No2 Mono</a>, the two typefaces and the various variations of the logo come together perfectly in layouts that feel classic yet contemporary while exuding a bold confidence through the sophisticated, minimalist layouts and strong use of color. Nothing here relies on any fancy trickery or weird backgrounds or textures to get the job done… just good ol’ fashioned typographic hierarchy at its best.</p>

<blockquote>The most defining characteristic of Dallas is its approach to potential. This city doesn’t dwell on limitations or indulge in empty promises—it takes action and delivers results. That same relentless attitude would define the team’s presence on the field and guide our creation of its brand identity.</blockquote><h3><a href="https://www.modestworks.com/works/dallas-trinity-fc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ModestWorks project page</a></h3>

<p>Every bit of motion is great, bringing to life the excellent typography and, again, keeping things simple. I mean, these are all actually quite complex and well thought out behaviors but, like, nothing feels as if it&#8217;s trying too hard or like it&#8217;s gratuitous… there is a purpose to all the movements.</p>

                                            <p><strong>Relevant quote</strong><br /><em>[The] brand wanted to position itself for the future as it sought to branch out into new worlds and categories as it grew its business. That meant Tezza needed branding and a visual identity system that would lend itself to future growth and help separate itself from competitors. What's more, the brand's visual identity was lacking consistency, so they needed a ground-up strategic process to create firm brand guidelines. The new identity reflects the brand's commitment to fostering creativity and providing a platform for users to express themselves without limits.<br /><br />The world of fashion magazines and their impeccable editorial layouts inspired much of the brand refresh. The revamped custom wordmark has a chic, contemporary edge and confident personality that feels both elevated and robust. Additionally, the logo reinforces and emphasizes the humanistic nature of the app. The sharp, square angles echo the app's square photo format. That produces a sense of cohesion, but it contrasts with the photos, which are often more dreamy and organic by nature.<br /><br />Because the Tezza team is also close to their community, they retained the original Tezza face icon designed by Zhenya Rynzhuk. With the brand evolution, human contact—and knowing that there's a human at the other end of the app—was critical for Tezza and its users. The agency embraced the idea of bringing the face to life and incorporating playful elements, as it helped to maintain the artist's hand in the graphics, which helps to separate Tezza from feeling too "tech" as most photo and video editing apps have a cold, clinical feel. Moreover, the branding appears in many of Tezza’s pop-up activations, reinforcing the notion that the work was designed to live in the real world.

                                            <p><strong>Opinion</strong><br />
                                            The old logo was mostly fine, with a fashion-adjacent look that could easily pass as a small designer/retailer of trendy fashion apparel. Execution-wise it was rather clunky, with huge “Z”s and a very narrow “T” that also looked bolder than the rest. The new logo is a drastic shift to the other end of the spectrum across most visual traits, going from serif to sans serif, regular width to condensed, and light weight to black for a bolder, chunkier design. The execution is pretty good, especially with that “A” where its lower bottom angles make a hard turn into straight verticals at the same height as the horizontal strokes of the “E” and “Z”s. Both old and new logos are equally right for the app and brand… just different ways of conveying the lifestyle-y, influencer-y personality.<span></span> Beyond the logo I will have to admit I feel a little alienated by the identity… and in an odd way I think that's a compliment because as a Gen-X dude who feels being on social media constantly is an unfulfilling burden I am clearly not the audience and pretty much everything shown after the logo is an ode to the influencer, with moody photos of young people dressed in cool ways and posing like they have zero fucks to give (except they give SOOO many). Sorry, that sounds bitter somehow. I'll get to the facts now: The typography throughout is kind of nice… the choice of <a href="https://klim.co.nz/retail-fonts/untitled-serif/" target="_blank">Untitled Serif</a> is as deadpan as you can get with a serif, giving it an academic, editorial vibe but that is also too cool for school and it works great as a contrast to the bold, condensed logo. Overall, I'm not exactly sure what the identity actually is or does, which may actually be a good thing (and I don't mean that sarcastically) as it allows Tezza to be more things to more people and adapt its loose, playful visual language to different merch and activations without painting itself into a corner.</p>

To launch its new “NO” line of sneakers, NTW tapped London-based agency, <a href="https://raggededge.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ragged Edge,</a> to craft a visual and verbal identity as unapologetic as the shoes themselves. What began as a campaign to say “no” to inflated prices, compromise, and conformity evolved into a full-scale rebrand, giving NTW a cohesive system that amplifies its defiant attitude, street-level grit, and independent spirit.</p>

<p>The previous NTW logo — an orange, script-like monogram encased in a chunky oval — leaned hard into retro charm. It looked like a patch pulled straight from a <a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/539376492852315336/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vintage service station attendant shirt or jacket,</a> the kind that had a resurgence in the early ’00s. If NTW were a nostalgia-driven sneaker brand, that would be one thing, but for a company so future-focused, it was already running out of road. While the friendly, vintage curves were approachable, the overall execution felt generic and start-up-y, relying on what appeared to be an out-of-the-box font — quite possibly nothing more than a thickened version of <a href="https://housefonts.com/hi/signpainter#" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sign Painter Script</a> from <a href="https://housefonts.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">House Industries.</a> Don’t get it twisted: I love House Industries as much as the next type-and-design nerd, and Sign Painter is a gorgeous type family. But while there’s nothing particularly <em>wrong</em> with this old logo, it lacked the distinctiveness and personality NTW needed to stand out.</p>

<p>Enter the future: NTW’s new logo system ditches the soft, playful orange in favor of a stark, bold red — a color that demands attention and refuses to be ignored. Gone too is basic #ffffff white. In its place is a light gray that feels sharper, more deliberate, and more modern.</p>

<p>The &#8220;NTW&#8221; monogram is a bold, futuristic departure from its predecessor. The letterforms feel less <em>designed</em> and more <em>engineered</em> — heavy, modular, and stripped to their raw essentials. It&#8217;s geometric and unapologetically industrial, like something you’d see stamped on a shipping crate.</p>

<p>The “No Two Ways” full logotype takes that modularity and pushes it further, stretching its letterforms into extended, horizontal shapes that demand attention. The result is deliberate, assertive, and undeniably ownable. What I love the most is the clever use of slash-zero characters in place of the “O”s, turning them into visual metaphors for NTW’s manifesto of “NO” — no Big Sneaker, no inflated prices, no playing by the rules, no compromises, no bullshit. It’s a typographic move so obvious it feels inevitable, and that’s what makes it so good. It’s not just a typographic quirk — it’s a statement embedded in the design itself.</p>

<p>Then there’s the “NO” mark, which began as a campaign element for NTW’s “NO” sneaker line but has since been adopted by the master brand as a visual shorthand for NTW’s manifesto. By extracting the already impactful “NO” with the slash-zero from the full logotype, the mark becomes a symbol of defiance, conviction, and purpose. It’s simple. It’s strong. It’s the visual equivalent of a mic drop.</p>

<p>However, there&#8217;s one (pretty minor) thing I can’t quite wrap my head around, which is the fact that some letterforms touch while others don&#8217;t. In the NTW monogram, none of the letters touch — each one stands firmly on its own. But in the full “No Two Ways” logotype, the “N” and “O” in “NO” are connected, as are the “W” and “O” in “TWO,” yet none of the other letters touch. It’s an odd inconsistency, and maybe there’s an underlying logic I’m missing, but if there is, it’s not obvious from the outside looking in.</p>

<blockquote>
The campaign is a response to No Two Ways turning down an acquisition offer from a major sneaker giant—a moment the brand seized to reaffirm its values. 
<br /><br />
“When No Two Ways came to us, they wanted to use this moment to reinforce everything their brand stands for, in the most impactful way possible,” said Jessica Bong-Wong, Associate Creative Director at Ragged Edge. “The relaunch gave them the platform to say it loud and clear: no compromises, no conformity, no two ways about it.”

<figcaption>Tone of voice, messaging, and typography.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>If NTW’s tone of voice had a sound, it would be the background drone of London’s city noise — cars, buses, and motorcycles whizzing by, the beeping of a construction vehicle in reverse, police sirens in the distance, the rumbling clunk of a trash truck emptying a dumpster, and a host of other nonspecific thuds, clanks, and mechanical echoes bouncing off concrete. It’s bold, defiant, and as street-level as a scuffed-up alley wall. Every message hammers home the brand’s central manifesto of “NO” — no playing it safe, no following the rules, and absolutely no compromise. This energy is made explicit in campaign lines like “Go where you’re not meant to,” “No parking,” “No entry,” and “Wrong turns only” — each one nodding to street signage but with a rebellious twist. It’s not just clever copy; it’s a direct challenge to conformity, perfectly aligned with NTW’s ethos as an anti-Big Sneaker brand.</p>

<p>The typography follows suit, pulling visual cues straight from street signage and industrial wayfinding systems. The primary typeface is a condensed, Helvetica-like grotesque sans serif that I can’t quite identify, but it has a few quirks — most notably, a spurless “G” that stands out in its minimalism. Supporting it is a secondary, unidentified monospaced sans serif that adds a technical, utilitarian edge to the brand’s typographic compositions. The interplay of these two styles is gritty and raw, like a factory label slapped on with purpose. The color palette sticks to this same stripped-down logic: bold red, crisp black, and light and medium gray. It’s a palette that’s as stark and uncompromising as the brand itself, making NTW’s messages feel like directives, not a suggestions.</p>

<blockquote>
Rooted in NTW’s East London origins, the campaign channels street culture with bold visuals and unapologetic messaging, embodied by the line ‘Rats Go Where They Want’. 
<br /><br />
The rest of the identity takes inspiration from the London streets. An unconventional rat icon is supported by type and iconography that references street signage.

<p>As Ragged Edge puts it, “Rats go where they want.” The rat icon — unconventional, scrappy, and subversive — channels NTW’s East London roots and its embrace of street culture. While rats typically get no love aside from Remy from Ratatouille, and some might recoil at the choice (“A rat? Gross.”), I see it as something far bolder: a statement about embracing — and loving — <em>all</em> aspects of the city. The good, the bad, the ugly. I’m from Baltimore, and this reminds me of the <a href="https://atomicbooks.com/products/official-baltimore-rat-sticker" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“BALT” rat sticker</a> — an underground emblem that spread across Charm City and now adorns countless bumpers, car windows, skateboards, street signs, light poles, trash cans, and pretty much anywhere else you can slap a sticker.  NTW’s rat is cut from the same cloth. It’s an embrace of the grit and the grime, a rallying cry for the underdog, and an extended middle finger to Big Sneaker’s gloss and polish. It&#8217;s defiant, unapologetic, and perfectly in step with the brand’s manifesto of “NO”.</p>

<p>The supporting visuals take their cues straight from London’s streets, borrowing inspiration from industrial signage and wayfinding systems. Bold, directional arrows dominate layouts, and the low-res, pixelated quality of NTW’s icons — flickering arrows, running silhouettes, and flashing pedestrian signals — mimic the lo-fi visuals of crosswalk indicators and digital traffic signs. It’s a deliberate imperfection that makes the system feel gritty, functional, and grounded, as though lifted directly from the streets themselves. The rat isn’t just a standalone icon; it integrates into this system, walking across arrows or nestling within grid-based compositions, creating a blueprint-like design language. Together, the rat, signage-inspired icons, and stripped-down design system form a cohesive identity that feels functional, rebellious, and deeply rooted in NTW’s urban DNA.</p>

<p>OK, this has nothing to do with Ragged Edge’s stellar work on the rebrand, but I personally find <a href="https://www.notwoways.com/products/m1-eclipse" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the sneakers</a> themselves to be ugly af. I’m no Sneaker Freaker, but I know a good pair of kicks when I see one, and these NTW sneakers are just <em>not</em> for me. To be fair, I’m a Gen Xer — clearly <em>not</em> the target audience here — and my taste skews old school. Give me OG timeless classics like adidas Originals <a href="https://www.adidas.com/us/stan-smith-lux-shoes/IF8844.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Stan Smith,</a> <a href="https://www.adidas.com/us/gazelle-indoor-shoes/JI2756.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gazelle,</a> <a href="https://www.adidas.com/us/samba-og-shoes/IE3437.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Samba,</a> and <a href="https://www.adidas.com/us/sl-72-rs-shoes/IG4649.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SL &#8217;72,</a> Nike&#8217;s <a href="https://www.nike.com/t/killshot-2-leather-mens-shoes-72M7D1/432997-107" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Killshot,</a> or Puma’s <a href="https://us.puma.com/us/en/pd/suede-classic-xxi-sneakers/374915?search=true&#038;swatch=02" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Suede Classic</a> any day. NTW’s designs, on the other hand, feel like an ironic riff on Nike’s <a href="https://www.nike.com/t/air-monarch-iv-mens-workout-shoes-p8qNlT/415445-101" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Air Monarch,</a> the ultimate “dad shoe” that somehow found its way onto trendier feet. Please tell me these sneakers were designed ironically, because, if so, then I&#8217;d get the joke. Somehow, though, I get the feeling these sneakers were designed <em>earnestly,</em> and there are probably legions of Gen Zers who love these things. And, well, you like what you like. Me? I’ll stick with the classics.</p>

<blockquote>
NTW launched the campaign on the brand’s social channels, with the identity also coming to life across sneaker designs, packaging, in-store activations and wild postings. All supported by a series of stunts that included emblazoning the logo on a football pitch, and even in the skies above Nike HQ in Portland.

<p>NTW’s new identity shines in its applications, where the rebellious, street-level attitude is brought to life with sharp execution and unexpected details. The packaging is a standout — sneakers (seemingly) come in a sweet, vacuum-sealed foil bag that feels equal parts futuristic and premium. Then there’s the rat-themed packing tape, which subverts the polished aesthetic of luxury packaging with a dose of grit and personality. The OOH advertising takes things further with bold, glitchy visuals and type that flicker and shift like a broken street sign, reinforcing the brand’s raw, urban energy. Meanwhile, the b&#038;w lifestyle photography adds a timeless contrast to the bold red and gray system, grounding the brand in a real, no-nonsense aesthetic. Together, these applications create a cohesive visual language that feels functional, rebellious, and unmistakably NTW.</p>

<p class="end">Overall, NTW’s rebrand — powered by Ragged Edge — is a bold, unapologetic move that perfectly channels the brand’s manifesto of “NO.” No compromises. No gloss. No bullshit. From the modular letterforms to the scrappy rat icon and the glitchy, street-inspired visuals, the system feels deliberate, cohesive, and refreshingly self-assured. While Ragged Edge and NTW are just saying NO to Big Sneaker and all its baggage, I’m saying YES to this rebrand. (Just not the sneakers.)</p>
