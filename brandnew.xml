That includes a more refined and authoritative logo, clear and transparent product claims that focus on facts and flavour-specific block colours, offset against the brand black.<br /><br />As a way to help customers navigate the information on pack, inspiration was taken from the raw recipes themselves – each of which is calibrated to Nutriment’s ideal nutritional balance of 85% raw meat, 15% fresh vegetables and superfoods. Robot Food reimagined this 85-15 split as the ‘building blocks of nutrition’ design system, providing the information architecture for the packaging and off pack communication.<br /><br />Along with the ‘building blocks of nutrition’ design system, the experience is tied together across touchpoints with a direct and bold tone of voice that authoritatively leads the category, balancing the emotional and rational messages to meet the needs of each audience.

                                            <p><strong>Opinion</strong><br />
                                            The old logo was not good, with a painful concoction of ligatures in a unicase rounded sans serif. The new logo is not good either as it oddly maintains the equity of the old one by sticking to all the bad decisions previously made and making modifications that don't improve the logo in any way. The painful “nuT” triple ligature remains in place even though it should not exist and while we could at least  breathe a sigh of relief that it's not the quadruple “nuTR” ligature of before, it has been replaced with the smallest “r” possible and if you were feeling cheated on the amount of ligatures from before, they replaced the one in in “nuTR” for one in “Im” and it's as painful to look at as the rest. It brings me no joy to critique this logo so harshly but I really am baffled by it. It's also a good reminder, after so many wordmarks recently that made me question myself, of why I dislike unicase.<span></span> It's too bad that the logo is so awkward because the packaging redesign is actually really good, with some very nice monotone color compositions set against a dark gray in a modular grid that that is easy to replicate and adapt to the different structures. The profile photos of the dogs are a nice deviation from the usual front shot of dogs on pet food packaging and I like how they are looking directly at the bowls of food in front of them, which are also very well composed and photographed. With this being raw food it would have probably been tempting to do a more earthy, organic, grungy aesthetic but this more “clinical” and clean look is beneficial in making the raw food diet more palatable and less radical for human owners. Overall, a great packaging evolution and a strong identity system with a distinctive gray background color that adds a touch of boldness and sophistication but it's hard to get over that logo.</p>

<h1 class="friday_likes">Frukt by Tomi Leppänen</h1>
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/friday_likes_frukt.jpg" alt="Frukt by Tomi Leppänen" />

<p style="margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;"><a href="https://www.frukt.coffee/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Frukt</a> is a specialty coffee roaster and café in Turku, Finland. The packaging, designed by somewhere-in-Finland-based <a href="https://tomileppanen.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tomi Leppänen</a>, is annoyingly simple, with the name of the roastery scaled immensely around the pouches. Part of what makes this more special beyond the dimension (and the fact that, gasp, you can&#8217;t read the full name of the brand on the front of the product) is the playful arrangement of the letters in the logo, rotated and displaced just enough to give the deadpan sans serif (GT America, I believe) some extra personality and create a more interesting tension as the letters parade from the front to the gusset to the back of the bag. The off-white labels on the white pouches is a pretty nice touch too, although it&#8217;s actually <a href="https://www.frukt.coffee/pages/store" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a range of pastel colors</a> beyond what&#8217;s shown in the case study and  that&#8217;s just even nicer. Scandinavian sensibilitity at its finest. <span class="pagination_divider"></span><span class="small_caps"><a href="https://tomileppanen.com/FRUKT" target="_blank" rel="noopener">See full project</a></span></p>

<h1 class="friday_likes">Cantina Mandia by UFFICIO</h1>
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/friday_likes_cantinamandia.jpg" alt="Cantina Mandia by UFFICIO" />

<p style="margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;"><a href="https://www.instagram.com/cantinamandia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cantina Mandia</a> is an Italian restaurant in Buenos Aires, Argentina, nestled in <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C7_yjlTMOY1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a tiny</a> but <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C3SVCnoL8R7/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ever so charming</a> location. The identity, designed by local firm <a href="https://www.ufficio.studio/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">UFFICIO</a>, is inspired by 1960s Italian cinema, employing a vintage aesthetic throughout and sourcing the color palette from a photo of Sofia Loren taking a break on set. Leading the way in Art Deco vibes is the use of 205TF&#8217;s <a href="https://www.205.tf/molitor" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Molitor</a>, which is a pretty great typeface and the handful of applications take advantage of its Roman and Italic styles to make some fun, slanted-yet-straight compositions like the menu cover or the logo where each letter is individually rotated in its Italic style but aligned at the bottom, giving the Art Deco foundation a contemporary (almost literally) spin. The chiseled gold leaf treatment on the window is icing on the cake. <span class="pagination_divider"></span><span class="small_caps"><a href="https://www.ufficio.studio/cantinamandia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">See full project</a></span>

<h1 class="friday_likes">Escape by TUX</h1>
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/friday_likes_escapecoffee.jpg" alt="Escape by TUX" />

<p style="margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:30px!important;"><a href="https://escape.cafe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Escape</a> is a coffee roaster in Montréal, Québec. The identity, designed by local firm <a href="https://tux.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TUX</a>, is a clash of elements  — based on the strategy of “Going Against the Grain” — that perhaps don&#8217;t belong together but they are all delivered with such a confident and bold attitude that it&#8217;s hard to disagree. The logo stacks “ESCAPE COFFEE” in a geometric monospace typeface (or perhaps custom design), which is then paired with an icon that is perhaps an abstract wing, perhaps an abstract coffee cup, perhaps none of those but it echoes the various “E”s in the logo and it works well. There are some grungy, weird illustrations and an Art Deco-ish headline typeface takes things in a slightly different direction than the logo. The packaging is as bold as it gets, with the name printed big and tight in the gusset in some bright colors. The presentation of the project is endearingly chaotic through some of the photos, like the stacked bags of coffee inside a messy car or someone jogging in the snow while spilling coffee from a mug. The grain has been properly gone against. <span class="pagination_divider"></span><span class="small_caps"><a href="https://tux.co/en/work/detail/escape-coffee/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">See full project</a></span></p>

                                            <p><strong>Relevant quote</strong><br /><em>Istorima’s identity bridges distinctive qualities from the worlds of sound and cinema using layout principles that revisit both. Diving into this dynamic fusion, and exploring the different visual languages that developed through decades, we found movie posters and vinyl records. On the one hand, movie posters’ format principles intensify the dramatic character of each story, while vinyl records’ format serves as a reference to Istorima’s mission to bring us closer through listening to each other’s side. <br /><br />Istorima’s logotype is designed to inspire dynamism and disruptiveness, aligning with the brand’s vision to redefine the way we connect both to our history and each other. The idea combines a series of elements and notions that are key to Istorima’s vision and positioning. Primarily, it features the rising volume’s form to represent Istorima’s empowering role in sharing people’s oral stories. At the same time, the logotype’s angle gives a sense of perspective, aligning with Istorima’s promise of sharing stories to offer a new perspective of how we see the world and what we know about it.<br /><br />With the brand’s messaging at hand, our selection for Istorima’s main brand typeface was driven by the need to communicate the intense and immersive character of the platform’s content. Thus, we went for Helvetica Neue, a clean, straightforward and highly legible typeface, that allows strong and direct messaging, while being functional for use in titles and more extended paragraph texts on both print assets and web interfaces. Moreover, the titles’ layout draws upon the central alignment of movie credits and quote extracts, adding an extra distinctive asset to Istorima’s typographic language and achieving consistency with the cinematic concept that crosses Istorima’s identity.

                                            <p><strong>Opinion</strong><br />
                                            The old logo was more or less okay, using what I am assuming are quotes to signify a story being told but they were a little too sharp and aggressive. The wordmark was pretty bad though, with way too much spacing and a “t” and an “r” that had nothing to do with anything. The new logo evokes storytelling in a different way, like a megaphone with the volume (and impact) of a story increasing as it goes out into the world. It's also nicely executed in a quirky, rounded sans serif with proper optical thickening/thinning as the letters grow. It's not the first (or last) time we see this treatment — <a href="https://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/new_logo_and_identity_for_arts_santa_mnica_by_mario_eskenazi.php" target="_blank">Exhibit A</a>, <a href="https://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/new_logo_for_guadalajara.php" target="_blank">Exhibit B</a> — and this demonstrates how fun and satisfying it can be whenever it's employed.<span></span> Things take a drastic turn in the identity as the layouts adopt movie-poster-like treatments with Helvetica Neue as the primary typeface with radically different spacing approaches within the same layout. Headlines are super tight; subheadlines are beyond loose. Oddly, it works. Even the logo, that has nothing to do visually with the typographic arrangements sits comfortably at the bottom as an endorser, like a movie production studio. The moody, lo-fi imagery adds a noir allure to the whole thing and the few instances where display typefaces are introduced for different titles, they feel well integrated and, like, of course some pixelated blackletter makes sense. Overall, this is a fairly unique combination of stylistic approaches and one that deviates from the happier, influencer-esque vibes of most podcasts today, hinting at some juicy, historical narratives.</p>

The museum&#8217;s building, designed by Mexican architect, Pedro Ramírez Vázquez, and Swiss architect, Jean-Pierre Cahen, is spread over five levels, occupying 11,000 square meters and the exterior areas around 12,000 more. Located in Lausanne, Switzerland — home to the International Olympic Committee since 1915 and known as the Olympic Capital — the museum&#8217;s international exhibitions and programs connect people with the stories, art, history, and culture of the Olympic Games and, “through educational initiatives inspired by the Olympic values of respect, friendship and excellence,” it “brings together athletes, visitors, students, artists, and an affiliated network of museums across the world”.

Recently the museum introduced a new identity designed by London, UK-based <a href="https://studioblackburn.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Studio Blackburn</a>.</p>

<blockquote>One of the key aspects of the brief was to provide enough differentiation from the Olympic Master Brand while giving the Museum its own identity. Our goal was to create a strong emotional connection and generate excitement around the experience and its artefacts, in the museum in Lausanne as well as internationally through their website. The majority of the future audience for the Olympic Museum will experience it remotely. It was crucial that we approached this with the concept of a museum that lives locally and thinks globally.</blockquote><h3>Studio Blackburn provided text</h3>

<blockquote>Aided by a rationalisation of the existing brand architecture, there was a clear move away from the Olympic Museum’s previous acronym of ‘TOM’ and a decision to no longer use the word ‘The’ in the logo. The identity needed to ensure that the Museum maintains its influence within the cultural world and emphasises its significance beyond sports.<br /><br />To capture the power and emotion of Olympism, we created an identity system that is expressive and iconic, whether in motion or in static form. It had to work and adapt to the three languages of the Museum: English, French, and German. This was supported by a flexible brand system that stretches from sophisticated to playful. A distinctive feature of the new look is the customised ‘M,’ a subtle contemporary twist on the Olympic Museum Symbol, which has also been refreshed and redrawn.</blockquote><h3>Studio Blackburn provided text</h3>

<p>The old logo felt like a random set of assets that found their way together. Obviously, there is the official rings logo for the Olympics so, so far, so good. The rings are supported by three columns, which I imagine are representative of the three official Olympic values of excellence, respect, and friendship and they also look like Greek building columns, which serves as a reminder of the birthplace of the Olympics. These two elements are admittedly not random but how they are put together in the combination of the colorful rings with the grayed out columns and the addition of the seemingly random and out-of-place serif is what made it look so disparate and cobbled together.</p>

<p>The new logo manages to create a more cohesive unit — under the assumption that the rings and columns <em>had</em> to stay and there was no room to introduce a new visual — that brings the elements together. Equalizing the rings and columns in the same color works wonders to make them feel like they are now playing off of each other and using the rings without their connection notches creates a much cleaner graphic. Losing the “The” in the logo allows the wordmark to be split into two to better match the two icons on the left and the <em>pièce de résistance</em> here is the treatment of the “M”s which serve as a visual bridge with the columns and to give the logo an unexpected edginess but one that feels restrained, elegant, and poised. It&#8217;s a great visual hook for the logo and for the identity.</p>

<blockquote>Using the rebrand to its full potential, we generated an ongoing poster series for use when there are no temporary exhibitions to facilitate advertising space. The posters celebrate a wide range of Olympic artefacts, using the colours of the Olympic rings as a backdrop. They needed to work across Europe, offering a glimpse into the Museum’s many artefacts, we want the world to know that the Olympic flame is for everyone.</blockquote><h3>Studio Blackburn provided text</h3>

<p>The applications are relatively straightforward in their layouts with the simple combination of extra large headlines and logo with cool, historic (and contemporary) imagery and footage. It&#8217;s kind of hard to go wrong with it yet this gets it very right and everything feels bold and energetic. The use of the five colors in the Olympic rings as backgrounds makes sense but I would have loved for this to stick to a black and white color palette and allowing the photography to provide the colors as some of the layouts with the background primary colors start to look informal somehow but, again, it&#8217;s an appropriate route and, to play my own devil&#8217;s advocate, a solely black and white identity may have turned out too drab and not celebratory enough.</p>

<p>I was also a little on the fence about the use of the silhouetted objects that look a little bit weird floating on the bright colors but they do serve as a good reminder that the content of this museum are these actual objects and you can come see them isolated in all their Olympic glory. I also like how the rings and columns can be used on their own… looking almost like they belong together.</p>

<p class="end">The logo and identity also make for some excellent merch, adding <a href="https://olympics.com/museum/visit/shop" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to an already stacked line of products</a>. Overall, this is a great identity that manages to infuse a lot of unique personality into the official International Olympic Committee universe that tends to be more reserved and airtight in what is allowed and not allowed so getting away with so much thanks to so little through the customized “M” deserves to take the gold home.</p>
