Lazy Tan is more than a sunless option – it’s the smart choice for those who know better. With an identity rooted in effortless elegance, its shadow-inspired icon celebrates sun avoidance as something to be proud of. Vibrant yet understated, the design seeks to exude confidence and quality, just like the flawless tan it provides.

                                            <p><strong>Opinion</strong><br />
                                            Using Emigre's <a href="https://www.myfonts.com/collections/base-900-sans-ot-font-emigre?refby=ucllc" target="_blank">Base 900</a>, the logo honors the name with a simple typographic solution that could be labeled as lazy… not in a bad, accusatory way but in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRhTeaa_B98" target="_blank"><em>Lazy Sunday</em></a>, laissez-faire way. The rounded “A”s, the generous spacing, the monospace alignment, the brownish color… it's just chill. Having said that, it might actually be just a tad too simple and the addition of the period to fill in the lack of a fourth letter in the second line might be an easy way out that doesn't actually add any meaning to the logo.<span></span> Taking a relatively bigger swing is the “LT” monogram that plays off of the product's tagline of “Made in the Shade” by casting a “T” shadow from the “L”, which is kind of clever but something about the execution is a little off… it might be the way the two letters are colored in the different instances of the packaging… like, it's never a true, darker shadow, which, granted, may be me being too literal but, still, somehow the effect ever so slightly misses the mark.<span></span> The color palette of yellow and red-ish brown is actually quite nice and I really like how they are inverted in the packaging, with the box using a yellow background with the brown on top and the bottle the opposite way (taking advantage of the color of the bottle itself). The few other applications shown are alright… The extended use of Base 900 is fun, particularly when used in yellow and the attempt at using the bottle as an iconic representation of the brand — a la Tabasco or Coca-Cola — is a valiant if premature effort. Overall, a minimal yet playful solution with some unique design choices to make this more interesting and memorable than expected.</p>

Founded by former J. C. Penney employee Sam Walton with a single location in Rogers, Arkansas, Walmart first grew in its state in 1960s, then nationally in the 1970s, and by 1980 it had reached $1 billion in annual sales, faster than any other company at that time. Headquartered in Bentonville, AR, the company now has more than 10,500 stores in 19 countries, employing approximately 2.1 million associates worldwide — making it the world&#8217;s biggest private employer — attracting approximately 255 million customers each WEEK. This week, Walmart introduced a new identity designed in-house in collaboration with <a href="https://www.jkrglobal.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jones Knowles Ritchie</a>.</p>

<blockquote>Walmart’s brand identity has evolved to reflect what the retailer offers today, while honoring what has always been special about the one-stop shopping destination. Walmart’s business has grown to meet the changing needs and wants of its customers from affordable prices to digital offerings to health services and more. This updated brand identity will better represent who Walmart is today. 
<br /><br />
Some key features of the brand’s refresh:
<br /><br />
• The wordmark is inspired by Sam Walton’s classic trucker hat and brought to life with a modern, custom font that differentiates Walmart from the crowd.<br />
• The spark exudes the energy of Walmart and remains a beacon that guides customers through all facets of the Walmart experience.<br />
• The color palette — True Blue and Spark Yellow — leans on the retailer’s most recognizable tones and its heritage of blue, while ushering in new updates to keep the brand fresh.<br />
• The tone is relatable, approachable and representative of the millions of customers that shop with Walmart, whether conveyed through its brand voice, illustrations or photography.</blockquote><h3><a href="https://corporate.walmart.com/news/2025/01/13/walmart-introduces-updated-look-and-feel-a-testament-to-heritage-and-innovation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Walmart press release</a></h3>

<figcaption>Spark construction.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>One of the key things to understand with this redesign is that the spark icon, on its own, is officially Walmart&#8217;s primary logo. <a href="https://brandcenter.walmart.com/brand/brand-identity/spark" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A new brand center microsite</a> — worth a lengthy visit — specifies that “The Spark can appear alone as a representation of Walmart or with our wordmark in the same composition, <strong>but they should never be placed right next to each other</strong>”. This is a significantly bold move as Walmart attempts to elevate its icon to the same level of recognition (and simplicity) as Nike&#8217;s swoosh or Target&#8217;s target and the goal is not out of the realm of possibility, given the ubiquity of Walmart in the American landscape and the inroad the Spark has already made <a href="https://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/less_hyphen_more_burst_for_wal.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">since being introduced in 2008</a>, becoming a clear and highly recognizable identifier for Walmart.</p>

<p>Created by Lippincott — <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/alex-de-janosi-a830721_walmartlogo-activity-7270444753048023041-rIDn?utm_source=share&#038;utm_medium=member_desktop" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reportedly based on these sketches by Alex de Janosi</a>, employed there at the time — the Spark was a surprise addition in 2008, given the many decades that Walmart had previously relied on bold, no nonsense wordmarks and in my review at the time, I wrote that its introduction was “very questionable”, a statement that was hard to disagree with at the time but that, 17 years later, as with most hindsight, it was shortsighted as the Spark has become quite the effective shorthand for Walmart.</p>

<p>In this new rendition, the Spark feels softer, warmer, and more friendly while being so much better executed with smoother curves and more pleasant individual segments than before, where it looked overly mechanical. The bolder weight of the segments gives the icon more presence and strength to stand on its own as it moves forward as the company&#8217;s primary logo. Godspeed, Spark.</p>

<figcaption>“Waterfall” color treatment.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The old, <a href="https://www.myfonts.com/collections/myriad-font-adobe?refby=ucllc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Myriad</a>-esque wordmark was arguably fine but there was definitely a default-ness to it that made it look cheap and, to this day, I find that “W” to be annoyingly drawn with its weird bottom corners. The new wordmark takes a cue from the 1980s and ’90s logos that had an <a href="https://www.myfonts.com/collections/antique-olive-font-urw?refby=ucllc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Antique Olive</a> influence that is now much more evident in the chunky new letterforms. As a big fan of anything that looks like Antique Olive I love this new wordmark, not only for its aesthetic but its improved impact and renewed sense of bold confidence — it almost feels as if the 2008 redesign was trying to apologize for being Walmart and this redesign is all about re-embracing some dominant Walmart-ness but less evil than than the ’80s and ’90s logo made them look.</p>

</figure>

<p>It probably goes without saying given my appreciation for the wordmark but I obviously like the new custom type family just as much. I could do without the light weight, but I understand its functionality in the identity. Bold and Black all the way, though. Also worth perusing <a href="https://brandcenter.walmart.com/brand/brand-identity/typography" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Typography section in the brand center</a> to peep the Headline, Mono, and UI variations.</p>

<p>Everyday Sans was drawn by Commercial Type’s Christian Schwartz with assistance from Thomas Bouillet. The new wordmark is also based on the typeface but with additional refinements. Miguel Reyes drew Always Script, which is used sparingly, as seen in a couple of the patches and one of the mugs posted further down below.</p>

<blockquote>The refreshed brand identity supports everything Walmart offers — from affordable prices to digital and health services. It emphasizes the role Walmart plays to an ever-evolving customer and their changing wants and needs, while honoring Walmart’s heritage and spirit of innovation. From the famous Spark symbol, now updated to be as dynamic as the people Walmart serves, to a wordmark drawn from Sam Walton’s iconic trucker hat, it all supports a distinctive, digital-first experience, that’s authentically Walmart.</blockquote><h3><a href="https://www.jkrglobal.com/work/walmart" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jones Knowles Ritchie project page</a></h3>

<p>Not much to see in actual application for now but even with the few renders and in looking through <a href="https://brandcenter.walmart.com/brand/brand-identity/layout" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Layout section of the brand center</a>, there is not much actually going on. I mean, there are plenty of rules and options and a clear system but given the amount of online and printed things that Walmart puts out on a regular basis, keeping things simple makes sense. The <a href="https://brandcenter.walmart.com/brand/brand-identity/brand-os" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Brand OS section</a> also highlights the most effusive design element, which are rounded-corner frames that can be used in slightly different ways, all of which can be experienced in the ads above. It&#8217;s all fine if unexciting.</p>

<p>Embracing a vintage Americana aesthetic and attitude, the swag, mugs, and patches are… cool? Like, it never ever crossed my mind that I might want to own a Walmart trucker hat or a Walmart varsity jacket but this stuff is not bad at all and it manages to make Walmart look as hip as it will ever be, which, granted, is not much, but for the past 20 years, Walmart has not been even remotely hip, not even in a forced way.</p>

<p class="end">Overall, this is an amazing improvement for Walmart, takes some of the best traits from its design history that, thanks to Father Time and Design Trends, have aged well and mixes it with the recent success of the Spark icon to establish a bold, confident, and engaging identity for the next 25 years.</p>

The new tagline, "Nature to Explore," expresses the desire to constantly push the boundaries of expertise while staying true to the artisanal product rooted in nature.

                                            <p><strong>Opinion</strong><br />
                                            Having undergone <a href="https://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/new_logo_identity_and_packaging_for_cidrerie_milton_by_lg2.php" target="_blank">a significant rebranding in 2017 when the company changed its name</a>, this evolution maintains the existing logo designed by LG2 but builds a new, illustration-driven identity around it. A minor shift in the logo updates the “CIDRERIE” descriptor to now appear in <a href="https://f37foundry.com/fonts/f37-attila" target="_blank">F37 Attila</a>, that stands out nicely thanks to its angled terminals in letters in the “R” and “X”, giving the new logo just a tiny bit more of an edge and that becomes the primary brand typeface.<span></span> The highlight of the project is the new rugged illustration style and in particular the hero spot illustration of the apple landing inside a stout glass with their overlay rendered in a grungy halftone pattern. An alternate version renders the full glass in the pattern and it's excellent too. The depiction of nearby Mont Yamasaka as a background graphic to frame imagery and text is fine but starts to look a little child-like with a torn-paper aesthetic. Nonetheless, it does work to support the new emphasis on nature.<span></span> The few packaging samples are fine for the most part but feel a little flat and unfinished, like they are trying to make cider be more upscale and elegant. By my own conclusions of this being either too flat or too illustrative, maybe the answer lies in a better balance and integration of the two as opposed to all or nothing on either end of the spectrum. Overall, a responsible evolution that doesn't discard their 2017 effort and infuses the identity with a subtle organic, nature-y touch but, mostly, more cool-apple-in-a-glass illustration please.</p>
