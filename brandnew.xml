In layman&#8217;s terms, people who give a s**t about other people and the planet. We believe the time has come to manage and equip short-term accommodation in ways that better reflect our human diversity and differing needs while respecting and enhancing the natural environment. We believe hosting should always be a force for good, aiming to enrich, showcase and support those in the communities in which we operate rather than take away from them. Fundamentally, we believe everyone should have the ability to get away in comfort and style, regardless of their individual background or circumstances. We&#8217;re striving for a tourism sector where everyone is truly welcome.&#8221;</p>

                                            <p><strong>Opinion</strong><br />
                                            The old logo was mostly fine although perhaps too shy and quiet and looking more like a small restaurant's logo than one aiming to be the Airbnb of more conscientious short-term bookings. The new logo has a much more confident and bold presence with a wordmark typeset in Klim Type Foundry's <a href="https://klim.co.nz/retail-fonts/family/" target="_blank">Family</a> — an apt name for this brand — and customized with a charming “fu” ligature. The icon is a little strange. I mean, it's clearly a heart in the negative space but for the life of me I can not understand what the four shapes around it are: chairs? houses? chimneys? horns? No explanation is given so, yeah, I'm not really sure. I kind of like it but its proportions are a little awkward with it being so tall and in the lock-up with the wordmark it feels too big.<span></span> Still, it's a nice graphic device, especially when used in a pattern or used in a super-tight zoom and crop. The weathered texture added to it has the warm, cozy vibe of a lived-in space. These feels are extended thanks to the lovely illustrations by <a href="https://jacksonjoyce.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jackson Joyce</a> that offer a welcome break from super crisp illustrations — also worth noting the great contrast of the more traditional painting method that makes the scenes depicted look as if they are from 1900s or a 1950s Norman Rockwell but the house has solar panels and the kid in the family setting has headphones. Not much in application, but the visual language is quite pleasant, with the Family type giving everything an approachable, friendly, and warm personality. Overall, this is a great identity that offers what looks like a more tranquil and zen version of Airbnb while still looking the part of a reputable booking platform.</p>

<p style="margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;"><a href="https://www.instagram.com/bamubakery" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BAMU</a> is a bakery in Macau, China, offering everything from loaves of bread to baked goods to coffee to ice cream. The identity, designed by local firm <a href="https://indegodesign.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Indego Design</a>, revolves around a wordmark with one of the funkiest set of ink traps I&#8217;ve seen in some time, putting a fun spin on the trend. One thing I&#8217;m unclear on is whether the wordmark already existed before this new set of packaging as browsing through <a href="https://www.instagram.com/bamubakery/tagged/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">their tagged images on Instagram</a>, the wordmark makes appearances in much older posts and along with a panda icon. What *is* clear is all the new stuff around the wordmark, which includes some delightful one-color illustrations of breads and an eclectic combination of typefaces. The color palette of tan, lavender, orange, and brown is lovely too but, clearly, the main attraction are the caramel egg tarts everyone tags them about. <span class="pagination_divider"></span><span class="small_caps"><a href="https://indegodesign.com/project/56" target="_blank" rel="noopener">See full project</a></span></p>

<p style="margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;"><a href="https://juanapaloma.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Juana Paloma</a> is a restaurant in Málaga, Spain, led by chefs Ana Rollán and Guadalupe Peñalver, that offers as close to a home-cooked meal as possible with fresh ingredients. The identity, designed by local firm <a href="https://tiquismiquis.club/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tiquismiquis</a>, has two key elements that are somewhat unrelated but that somehow work together. The first is a wordmark typeset in <a href="https://nuformtype.com/ozik" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ozik</a>, which will never not entertain me and the second is a white and blue gingham pattern, which is a very unexpected reference to pull into a restaurant. I like how it&#8217;s reminiscent of the classic-if-clichéd red and white checkered Italian restaurant tablecloths but more elegant. I do acknowledge this isn&#8217;t the most exciting of identities but I thought the gingham was a fun twist to restaurant design and how nicely it extended from staff uniforms to decor to design accents. <span class="pagination_divider"></span><span class="small_caps"><a href="https://tiquismiquis.club/juana-paloma-casa-de-comidas" target="_blank" rel="noopener">See full project</a></span>

<p style="margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:30px!important;"><a href="https://eatpep.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pep</a> is a brand of pepper available in Australia made from peppercorns grown in the red volcanic soils of Cambodia. The packaging, designed by Melbourne, Australia-based <a href="https://bennymooredesign.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Benny Moore</a>, also combines two unexpected elements. The first is the wordmark in an extra chunky, octagonal sans serif and the second is a goat. Why a goat? Pep&#8217;s FAQs has the answer: &#8220;Goats are hungry, they’ve got kick, and they go ‘meh’ at sad bland peppercorns&#8221;. I would have also accepted “Just because” since the crude illustration of the goat is so kick-ass. The whole vibe of the packaging is lo-fi with its primary colors palette, cheesy fonts, and basic printing. Under different ownership, this could have been a highly pretentious offering of artisanal pepper presented in high-end packaging with gold foil and rich, textured paper, which, to be honest, I would be all over too.

                                            <p><strong>Relevant quote</strong><br /><em>Audinate, the parent company of Dante, is listed on the Australian Securities Exchange and requires a more defined role as the creator of products and services for exceptional AV experiences. A new brand purpose was crafted to sit alongside the vision: Everyone Should Be Seen and Heard. This purpose emphasizes, rather than hides, that Audinate has a supportive role, allowing others to shine in the spotlight. This positioning gives them more room to explore new ways of redefining AV for the future.<br /><br />The new visual identity had to integrate seamlessly with the updated Dante brand identity; they share the same typeface, allowing smooth transitions between the two brands. Audinate also received a new symbol and wordmark based on the custom typeface used for both brands. This new identity allows Audinate to appear and disappear within the Dante identity as needed across various applications. With this refreshed identity, Audinate can continue its mission to redefine audio and video possibilities with the belief that everyone should be seen and heard.

                                            <p><strong>Opinion</strong><br />
                                            I can't say I like-like the old logo — primarily because of its spurless sans — but there is something about it that I enjoy. It reminds me of <a href="https://1000logos.net/logitech-logo/" target="_blank">the 1980s Logitech logo</a> somehow which, I guess, in principle makes it very dated. The new logo is a notch above fine thanks to the already-nice, existing proprietary typeface designed for its flagship product, Dante. (<a href="https://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/new_logo_and_identity_for_dante_by_bedow.php" target="_blank">Reviewed on Brand New earlier this year</a>.) It's a sturdy sans serif with the subtle yet distinctive blunt tops on the angled letters  like the “A” and “N” that give the wordmark some additional personality.<span></span> The highlight of the project is the monogram “A” even if there is a lack of a clear explanation of it or a meaning behind it — none is given, none is easily implied. Nonetheless, it's groovy AF and it bears some resemblance <a href="https://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/dante_logo_icon.png" target="_blank">to Dante's own icon</a> but it sort of exists on its own frequency in this identity as nothing around it supports its visual language. In fact, I'm kind of surprised — coming from Bedow — at how ambiguous and relatively generic the identity is with the most expressive element being some floating particles we've seen in one form or another a dozen times before. There is a bit of relevance between those graphics and the brand of idea of being “seen and heard” with the particles being a visual manifestation of sound traveling through the ether but… eh, it's a stretch. Overall, to use a sound/music analogy, the monogram is playing a wicked drum solo while the rest of the band is having a beer backstage and can't be bothered to come out. In less metaphorical terms, it's a somewhat unmemorable identity.</p>

Guggenheim Foundation</a> is dedicated to promoting the understanding and appreciation of modern and contemporary art through exhibitions, education programs, research initiatives, and publications. The foundation&#8217;s first foray was the Museum of Non-Objective Painting that opened in 1939 and featured the founder&#8217;s personal collection of abstract, contemporary art and it wasn&#8217;t until 1957 that it opened its most well known location in New York with its iconic building designed by Frank Lloyd Wright. Today, the foundation oversees an international “constellation” — the new key word — of museums that includes the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York; the Peggy Guggenheim Collection, Venice; the Guggenheim Museum Bilbao; and the future Guggenheim Abu Dhabi set to open in 2025. Last week, the Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation introduced a new identity designed by London, UK-based <a href="https://www.pentagram.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pentagram</a> partner Harry Pearce.</p>

<blockquote>Pentagram partner Harry Pearce was asked to create a new single-tier identity system for the constellation of museums that would work seamlessly across all its different activities, establishing it as a leading global cultural brand that provides unique art experiences across three continents. As well as unifying the organisation, it was important that the new identity would create a shared sense of purpose, aligning the Museum’s vision and values.</blockquote><h3><a href="https://www.pentagram.com/work/guggenheim-3/story" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pentagram project page</a></h3>

<blockquote>At the centre of the brand identity, the new Guggenheim logo is simple and authoritative and builds on the brand’s clear heritage of geometric typography. Strong, modern and impactful, it is designed for a global audience while firmly rooted in the Museum’s history.</blockquote><h3><a href="https://www.pentagram.com/work/guggenheim-3/story" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pentagram project page</a></h3>

<p>The old logo could be said, arguably, was as recognizable as the iconic New York building given that <a href="https://static.dezeen.com/uploads/2017/06/solomon-r-guggenheim-frank-lloyd-wright-new-york-150th-birthday_dezeen_hero.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">its design literally comes from the building itself</a>. The first to translate the lettering  etched on the museum&#8217;s facade into a logo was Massimo Vignelli in 1992 and it was developed into a more contemporary form by Pentagram partner Abbott Miller in 2013. (There is a great, detailed article on the museum&#8217;s identity history <a href="https://www.guggenheim.org/articles/checklist/how-the-guggenheim-got-its-visual-identity" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.) So, in one way or another, the Guggenheim&#8217;s identity in New York — and worldwide, as other locations adopted the same wordmark — has been intimately tied to this Mid-century geometric sans serif. Whether because of its own design merits or because of the association to such an iconic arts institution and building, the old logo was a classic. I mean, it wasn&#8217;t fantastic or Earth-shattering but it was perfectly executed and it effortlessly gave “Guggenheim”, which is probably the main reason the new logo takes one small step away from the old one so that the identity for this global institution isn&#8217;t so directly tied to one locale.</p>

<p>The new logo is… fine. The “G”s are interesting enough to make the logo a little unique despite adopting a more straightforward, bordering on the deadpan sans serif approach that fashion brands adopted en masse a few years ago. Design-wise, there is nothing inherently bad or great about it… it&#8217;s just a different-but-same take on the wordmark, which is where I struggle with this evolution. The new logo clearly tries to stick to the DNA of the original but also clearly tries to deviate from it but it doesn&#8217;t go nearly far enough to mark a significant shift, which makes you wonder why even change it at all. I do think there is some benefit in de-New-York-izing the logo and the bolder weight of the primary wordmark and the sub-brands is technically beneficial but I would have also loved to see a more drastic departure that echoes the big architectural swings the organization has taken with its other locations. To be honest, I could sit here all day making arguments both ways, so let&#8217;s move on.</p>

<blockquote>Based on an abstract form of the letter G, the new symbol is a singular and powerful mark that consolidates the different locations in a single unit, ‘holding’ the constellation together and reflecting the Museum’s new unified spirit. The symbol provides a simple, iconic sign-off, echoing the architectural form of the museums, and providing brand recognition across a wide range of varied touchpoints.<br /><br />The symbol can also appear as an outline, and beyond the formal version, a series of free-form iterations of the mark can also appear as animations and static images allowing the museums to have a more expressive side to their visual language.</blockquote><h3><a href="https://www.pentagram.com/work/guggenheim-3/story" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pentagram project page</a></h3>

<p>The bigger story in this identity is the introduction of a new “G” monogram, which is… fine. I realize I am not being overly intellectual in my first impressions here but, yeah, it&#8217;s an abstract, geometric “G” that has been nicely executed and constructed. It&#8217;s not exciting in any way but it&#8217;s also not wrong in any way. I would actually love to have more passionate feelings about it, regardless of whether they were positive or negative but it doesn&#8217;t quite hit any strong emotions. The identity is fine with it but it would also be fine without it. It definitely has a benefit in adding a brand asset that can serve as a shorthand for the foundation&#8217;s relatively long name that is impossible to fit in social media avatars and that could eventually become an instantly recognizable mark.</p>

<p>The one thing I do feel a strong emotion about is the MTV-lite approach to the stylistic variations of the monogram. These are painfully mundane and they are like a late 1990s, early 2000s version of the flexible identity trend. There is nothing visually interesting about these and they have no real relation to the art shown across the museums and are instead just clichéd interpretations of being “artsy”. The monogram in a stroke should be avoided as I think it dilutes the simplicity of the mark and completely changes the impression it makes. These also don&#8217;t seem to appear anywhere in the identity and I really doubt they ever will.</p>

<blockquote>Developed to work in perfect harmony with the new logotype, the primary typeface, Guggenheim Sans is a modern, human-looking geometric Open Source typeface. Adapted from the Open Source typeface Inter, which was originally drawn by Rasmus Andersson, two versions were created, Guggenheim Sans, and Guggenheim Sans Display.  Additionally, a specific Arabic version of the typeface has been created by Debakir and TB.D. Studios to work alongside this. The secondary typeface, Playfair (an Open Source typeface by Claus Eggers Sørensen), provides a refined contrast to the modernity of Guggenheim Sans. </blockquote><h3><a href="https://www.pentagram.com/work/guggenheim-3/story" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pentagram project page</a></h3>

To its credit, it&#8217;s kind of amazing that it made something more interesting out of <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Inter" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Inter</a> but I&#8217;m not sure how effective it is as a distinguishing typographic asset, especially if they are making it open source and anyone can “speak” in the same typographic voice.

<p>The layout system is actually quite nice and the applications end up looking strong and crisp but there is almost a lack of “brand” in all of this — at least for now, while the identity establishes its Guggenheim-ness. The combination of wordmark + icon + proprietary type aren&#8217;t the most cohesive either and when they appear together each one feels like it is doing its own thing for its own different organization. It&#8217;s like they want to share a DNA but they all have slight mutations in the strand that yields a collection of elements that are neither similar enough nor contrasting enough.</p>

<p class="end">Overall, this is fine but the identity for a renowned, global arts organization like Guggenheim should be more than just fine and perhaps there are unknown-to-us limitations about what the museum can or can&#8217;t do (or is willing to do or not do) with its identity as it relates to patrons, donors, media, and other market forces but given the risks it has taken with its buildings — Frank Lloyd Wright&#8217;s contribution included — it&#8217;s hard not to wish the identity would step up to the challenge.</p>
