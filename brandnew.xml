Armed with a ‘we can do this’ attitude, the three cast off from their careers in engineering and biology to pursue their passion for making great beer.&#8221;</p>

                                            <p><strong>Relevant quote</strong><br /><em>This is a 30+ year old brewery with no visual equity to speak of. Out of everything we reviewed, we only found these elements were worth retaining and exploring:<br /><br />– The arched typography <br /><br />– The barn (while not historic, this has been around for a minute (since their previous rebrand), so there is some familiarity in the market place. Plus, it speaks to their broader positioning in a compelling way. More on this in a sec.)<br /><br />That’s it for visual equity. But what Wachusett lacks in visual equity, it more than makes up for in Brand Equity. <br /><br />We highlighted this up top, but the brewery is known for fun outdoor concerts, the beautiful Central Mass countryside (and all the fun activities that come along with that) and Blueberry Ale. <br /><br />Wachusett’s Blueberry Ale is such an important part of their business that this entire project revolved around its packaging. This is a monster brand — comprising ~85% of their sales — so this packaging was every bit as important as their brand identity itself. And the real opportunity at hand is for Wachusett to completely own the blueberry / fruited-beer segment throughout New England.

                                            <p><strong>Opinion</strong><br />
                                            The old logo had a charming, homespun quality to it that was perfectly fine for a then nascent, young, micro brewery but with the brewery's growth and the beer's popularity, it had limited appeal as well as not a whole lot of room to expand to a broader audience through placement in bigger retailers. The new logo isn't particularly innovative and, in a way, it's a little more generic than the old one within the realm of craft breweries but even then its presence is stronger, more confident, and better poised for growth if not necessarily differentiation — the fact that their flagship beer is a blueberry beer does plenty of differentiating. The industrial, gritty aesthetic never not works and it is quite well done in the primary logo and the dozens of secondary marks and taglines that sprinkle in some bonus script typography and wood motifs for a never-ending rustic vibe. It might actually be one too many assets but they are all great so who am I to argue?<span></span> The old packaging was in line with the old logo, with its supporting typewriter typography and etched-style illustrations. Nothing terribly bad but nothing terrible exciting either. The new packaging aims for a much bolder impact on the shelf with strong contrasts in its color blocking, red accents, and in-your-face typography. Designed by CODO, the Blueberry Ale can is by far the best resolved and most interesting given it is the main attraction while the others, designed by the brewery's design team, sort of just fill in the blanks in the main area of the label with a free-for-all approach that wins some and loses some… The Pilsner can is kinda cool but the Summer Ale and Wajuicett IPA are not kinda but a whole lotta not cool. I'm guessing those are seasonal, which is a fine place to experiment and have fun but a more unified and conscious approach would be necessary. Overall, it's undeniably a positive evolution that, while not the most unique, brings Wachusett in line with other popular craft beers and gives it a better chance at competing with them that the old logo and cans would not have been able to.</p>

<h1 class="friday_likes">12 by Base Design</h1>

<p style="margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;"><a href="https://www.instagram.com/12.matcha" target="_blank" rel="noopener">12</a> is a new matcha café in the Noho neighborhood of New York, NY. Founded by entrepreneur Alan Jiang, 12 sources its matcha from <a href="https://hottaen.jp/english/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hotta Katsutaro Shoten Co.</a> in Japan and works with its tea master, Haruhide Morita, as well as with flavor scientist Dr. Christopher Loss to offer the most authentic and sublime matcha possible. The identity, designed by the New York office of <a href="https://www.basedesign.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Base Design</a>, revolves around a stunning “12” logo that is constructed (or more like deconstructed) from “mini particles” that capture “the multifaceted sensations of drinking matcha”, which is a feeling I can not attest to as I&#8217;m not the biggest matcha fan but this logo and the photography of the product make me reconsider my stance because it looks delectable. Supporting the “12” is a simple, single-color green gradient rendered in the same mini particles that can adapt to the various packaging surfaces and other communications with ease and elegance while the main typeface, the rather obscure <a href="https://bold-decisions.biz/Typefaces/Gc-16" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gc-16</a>, adds a touch of New York hipness. Next time I&#8217;m in New York I might stop by just for the ice cream <a href="https://basedesign2.imgix.net/images/31_Base_12_IceCream.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">because look at it</a>. <span class="pagination_divider"></span><span class="small_caps"><a href="https://www.basedesign.com/work/12-matcha" target="_blank" rel="noopener">See full project</a></span></p>

<h1 class="friday_likes">Buzzing by The Click</h1>
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/friday_likes_buzzing.jpg" alt="Buzzing by The Click" />

<p style="margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;"><a href="https://buzzing.world/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Buzzing</a> is a new, 100% electric-powered coffee roastery in Norwich, UK, with a mission to “lead the revolution to decarbonise coffee roasting”. The identity, designed by local firm, <a href="https://theclickdesign.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Click</a>, is built around That Blue, which is probably the most conceptually sound instance of that choice given that That Blue is most commonly known as “Electric Blue” outside of Brand New so it matches perfectly with both the name of the company and its mission. Leading the charge is an extra bold wordmark with the two “Z”s in its name cleverly modified to reveal a lightning bolt in their negative space. We&#8217;ve seen this idea to an extent before with <a href="https://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/new_logo_and_identity_for_bolt_by_koto.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bolt&#8217;s logo by Koto</a> and, from <a href="https://www.google.com/search?sca_esv=8d8d37d839baca63&#038;sxsrf=AHTn8zoAvhTnDFZ7TRJKruztECWoiEGs2g:1743760493393&#038;q=buzz+logo&#038;udm=2&#038;fbs=ABzOT_CWdhQLP1FcmU5B0fn3xuWpA-dk4wpBWOGsoR7DG5zJBsxayPSIAqObp_AgjkUGqemmTG2DFZE7tmKcXVp5H8R-R5rx2cv4LdpyiJ4nHnaj22nzwRLb038fZUcDagzuU5JMvWvtjGNLL7KXZuMGJ8jJcUt7C8AOlnuhFVueytR4tMw9VPc1DLuELRcJx-63pH51AnlFH8SKHOwWLbFKS1gU3p3P7g&#038;sa=X&#038;ved=2ahUKEwj8w6CGjr6MAxXkv4kEHaMpCd4QtKgLegQIFBAB&#038;biw=1620&#038;bih=1158&#038;dpr=2#vhid=FDnHzErwgqoarM&#038;vssid=mosaic" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a quick Google search for “Buzz logo” at least one other logo has taken a similar approach</a>, which I bring up not as an accusation but quite the contrary to point out how nicely and expertly this one is crafted through the modification of the “Z”s. The bolt from within them is used generously throughout the few applications as a fun pattern or as a standalone graphic. The one odd thing might be the supporting typography on the packaging, which looks a little too old-time-y with its woodtype aesthetic and then the type on the website has too much going on on its own that it becomes distracting. Those “Z”s tho. <span class="pagination_divider"></span><span class="small_caps"><a href="https://theclickdesign.com/work/buzzing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">See full project</a></span>

<h1 class="friday_likes">Armin by Aparté</h1>
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/friday_likes_armin.jpg" alt="Armin - Aparté" />

<p style="margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:30px!important;">Disclaimer: This submission caught my attention because, I mean, how could it not with that kick-ass name? And how could I resist posting it when such a bad-ass rooster is its personification? All that narcissism that I probably need to unpack with a shrink aside, it&#8217;s also an excellent project so… <a href="https://www.armagnac-armin.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Armin</a> is an Armagnac — a distinctive kind of brandy produced in the Armagnac region in Gascony, southwest France — aged in 420-liter French oak barrels, with its oldest offering coming in at 12 years old. The packaging, designed by Paris, France-based <a href="https://www.apartestudio.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Aparté</a>, is a charming concoction of elements, starting with the arched, flared serif wordmark and its thick drop shadow that sits on top of a stoic rooster you don&#8217;t want to mess with. (I&#8217;m not sure what the meaning of the rooster is and it might be an obvious answer but, yeah, not gonna question it given how unexpected it is and how bold it stands on the label.) The supporting typography and ornaments are all great and I also quite like the unconventional die cut on the label with a heavy curve at the bottom and a flat top — usually it&#8217;s the other way around. The bottle itself also packs a punch, with the wordmark and ornaments built into the bottle as a raised texture. Not that I endorse heavy drinking but I&#8217;ll take one of each <a href="https://www.armagnac-armin.com/blogs/cocktail" target="_blank" rel="noopener">of their suggested cocktails</a>. <span class="pagination_divider"></span><span class="small_caps"><a href="https://www.apartestudio.com/branding/armin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">See full project</a></span></p>

                                            <p><strong>Relevant quote</strong><br /><em>At the heart of Ninth Edge is a simple yet powerful idea: <strong>Better conversations lead to better leadership.</strong> This belief informs every aspect of the brand, from training sessions to visual identity. Leadership is as much about communication as it is about strategy, and great leaders emerge through meaningful dialogue with their teams. Professional teams that communicate effectively create stronger connections, which lead to better working relationships and improved outcomes.<br /><br />At the heart of this identity is the custom logomark and logotype, both meticulously designed to embody the dualities inherent in effective leadership — bold yet thoughtful, dynamic yet grounded. The logomark, affectionately named “Quip,” is more than a symbol — it’s a direct reflection of Greg and Kyle in action. Inspired by the transformative power of conversation, Quip takes cues from quotation marks and a butterfly, representing the interplay of dialogue, growth, and progress. Its multidirectional form echoes the fluid, responsive nature of great leadership, much like the way Ninth Edge fosters impactful discussions that drive real change.<br /><br />Complementing Quip is the custom logotype, which strikes a balance between geometric precision and human warmth. Designed with expressive details — such as the distinctive forms of the “d” and “g” and the dynamic movement within the letterforms — the logotype reflects the brand’s focus on forward momentum and thoughtful progress. Like the founders themselves, it is structured yet flexible, intentional yet approachable.<br /><br />Supporting graphic elements, including brackets and arrow devices, enhance the visual storytelling by guiding the viewer’s eye and adding layers of meaning. The brackets and arrowheads, inspired by the humanist geometry of the logomark, serve as visual metaphors for the journey of leadership — directional, intentional, and always moving. Together, these elements create a cohesive and meaningful visual identity that not only looks striking but also embodies Ninth Edge’s core values of intelligence, approachability, and impact.

                                            <p><strong>Opinion</strong><br />
                                            The old logo had good intentions, building a cube out of the “NE” initials but its execution was clunky and confusing as the panels in the back stopped short and with its bland color palette it looked too much like a sad office cubicle. The wordmark, all in lowercase and in a lifeless sans serif, added to the drabness of the overall first impression. The new logo is a 180-degree turn with a far more energetic, refined, and dynamic presence thanks in part to the high contrast in thicks and thins in both the icon and the wordmark. With the brand idea of “conversation” fueling all the work, the icon instantly reads as two quote-slash-speech marks — even if you don't know what the brand idea is — and has the clever bonus of also being an abstract “9” and an abstract “e” to loosely echo the initials of the name. The icon looks great solo but I really dig when its placed within the “token” holding shape.<span></span> The wordmark doesn't default into a generic sans serif as normally would be the case and instead follows the cues of the icon with high contrasts, edgy curves, and bold terminals. I feel like the curve-to-stem connections are a little too contrast-y with the curves ending in a super thin point and perhaps could have more closely resembled the thicker transitions from the icon but it's a small complaint in an otherwise great wordmark. LOVE the “g”. The color palette is lovely too, with a blue that sits somewhere between muted and bright and a matching (in brightness and saturation) salmon-y color that are able to work together without creating that vibrating effect that blue and red cause.<span></span> The identity sticks to the high-contrast aesthetic with a fun slab serif, <a href="https://www.myfonts.com/collections/farao-font-storm?refby=ucllc" target="_blank">Farao</a>, as the primary typeface and a series of dingbats that all follow suit. In combination with the icon and logo, there is a fun textural quality to the applications and all of it created by type alone. The one small element that feels off is the monospace type, which could have been bolder and more loosely typeset for better presence. The monotone images work great in the layouts and serve as a nice reminder of how effective this photo treatment can be. Overall, this looks far better and works much harder than probably any other leadership training service and it just goes to show that even the most unlikely industry to have a polished, fun, and lively identity can be leveled up with good design.</p>

<a href="https://www.clubpiscine.ca/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Club Piscine</a> is Quebec, Canada&#8217;s largest retailer of pools, garden furniture, barbecues, spas, and fitness equipment with over 40 locations. Founded in 1991 by Robert Aumont, the company initially specialized in pools and pool equipment before expanding its offerings in 2004 to include fitness equipment, which led to the addition of &#8220;Super Fitness&#8221; to its name. It once again broadened its product range in 2019 to include barbecues. As the company approached its 35th anniversary, Club Piscine Super Fitness returned to its roots and rebranded itself as simply Club Piscine. The rebrand involved a collaboration with Quebec-based design studio <a href="https://www.caserne.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Caserne</a> and strategy agency <a href="https://www.rougecardinal.ca/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rouge Cardinal</a>. The goal was to refresh the brand&#8217;s identity while staying true to its origins and appealing to the expectations of a new generation.

<blockquote>
The main challenge was to update the [Club Piscine&#8217;s] image while preserving its core identity, which evokes both the warmth of summer and the quality of its products. The rebranding process was guided by key elements: a revised color palette, a modernized logo, and a new tagline, &#8220;Le meilleur de l&#8217;été&#8221; (&#8220;The Best of Summer&#8221;), which embodies Club Piscine&#8217;s promise and its expertise in outdoor living. This strategic and creative collaboration led to a refreshed visual language that captures both the brand&#8217;s legacy and its future ambitions.

<p>
If Armin had described Club Piscine&#8217;s new identity to me without any visuals — &#8220;a unicase rounded sans-serif logo in primary colors paired with a giant smiley face&#8221; — I would have begged him to let me review something else. That combination sounds like the makings of an identity fit for a preschool or a temp agency for clowns. But in Caserne&#8217;s hands, the result is surprisingly sophisticated—certainly better than a pool equipment retailer ever needed to be.
</p> 

<p>
While the logo has a slightly juvenile quality, that&#8217;s not the worst trait for an identity meant to evoke the joy of summer. Built from <a href="https://abcdinamo.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dinamo&#8217;s</a> Diatype Rounded, the logo&#8217;s unicase approach is fairly subtle, visually flowing better than an all-uppercase treatment. The circular shape of the lowercase “e” echoes the bubbly quality of the uppercase “B” in a way a capital “E” wouldn&#8217;t. The chosen lowercase letters were all the right call; if the “I”s were lowercase rather than the “N” for example, all sophistication would be lost—send in the clowns. While the typesetting could use some minor finessing (why does the “B” look slightly smaller than the rest of the logo?), it is undeniably a massive upgrade from the heinous clunker that was the old logo.

<p>
You definitely couldn&#8217;t build an identity related to pools without blue, and there are plenty of those hues in this palette. But it&#8217;s not all primaries, with some orangey salmons and soft pinks, which mostly shows up in the photography. The photography itself is bright and fresh, and truly makes me excited for summer. That said, when paired with the word &#8220;Club&#8221;, it almost gives the impression of a kid-friendly all-inclusive resort, which I suppose isn&#8217;t the worst problem for a pool equipment retailer. It&#8217;s aspirational: shop at Club Piscine and make your backyard feel like a hotel retreat.

<p>
The surprise standout for me is the chemical packaging, which, again, has absolutely no right to look this nice. Keep it far away from your kid&#8217;s craft supplies, as it could easily be mistaken for a bucket of Play-Doh, but its bold clarity and smart use of color for organization is not only visually satisfying, it likely stands out among competitors. Not to mention its clear functionality. I imagine myself lost in a cavernous supply warehouse, running an errand for my retired Florida dad (who insists on cleaning his own pool), frantically searching for something to increase alkalinity (whatever the hell that means) and just grabbing the big yellow bucket that says &#8220;ALKA+.&#8221; Perhaps the core audience is professional pool cleaners who already know what they&#8217;re looking for, but for a DIY crowd, the friendly directness could help gain some new customers.
</p>

<p>
But of course, thanks to its clear wayfinding, I wouldn&#8217;t get lost in a Club Piscine warehouse. The signage and advertising pull no punches. The rounded sans-serif and smiley face are playful enough that the rest of the applications just need some simple iconography and photography to stay visually engaging.

Overall Club Piscine&#8217;s new identity balances fun and practicality, making pool supplies feel approachable without going overboard. It proves that even the most utilitarian products can have a visual identity that&#8217;s both fun and modern. The logo is playful, the packaging eye-catching and intuitive, and the overall system is clear and cohesive. It may lean slightly toward youthful, vacation-like branding, but if that makes pool maintenance feel less like a chore and more like a fun activity or lifestyle upgrade, that&#8217;s a win.
