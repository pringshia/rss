                                            <p><strong>Relevant quote</strong><br /><em>With an ambitious directive from leadership, Contentsquare set out to become the ‘go-to platform for understanding people.’ To align with this vision, we helped position Contentsquare as the brand that offers actionable insights into people’s behaviour through effortless analytics. This positioning not only reflects the company’s new direction, but also resonates with what drives and inspires Contentsquare's people.<br /><br />Central to the identity is the graphic language, designed to convey three key principles that the platform promises: Space for Clarity, Customer Journeys, and Human Understanding. Moving away from the blue hues that saturate the tech industry, the design leans into a warm and sophisticated colour palette that sets Contentsquare apart within their category.<br /><br />The identity expresses the feeling of ease and understanding inherent in using the platform. By keeping it simple, the humanity at the heart of the brand can shine through.<br /><br />Contentsquare’s typographic system combines two font families to bring their voice to life with clarity and consistency. New Edge Rounded, a modern grotesque with rounded interiors and angular corners, captures a sense of ease and understanding, while Inter adds versatility, working seamlessly across everything from body copy to user interfaces.

                                            <p><strong>Opinion</strong><br />
                                            The old logo was fine but generic. The monogram-slash-icon did a decent job of putting a “square” inside the “C” to pay off on the name. The lock-up relationship was kind of wild though with the giant monogram looking like it's going to Pac-Man the wordmark. The new logo also takes a cue from the name and wedges a square into the counter and negative spaces of the letterforms, some to more success than others. The “C”, “O”, “S”, and “Q” look great with that treatment but the “E” and the “R” are very awkward. It's a shame the name doesn't have the same amount of letters in both words so that the monospace-ish wordmark could be full-justified instead of leaving the poor “T” out on its own. Still, a good logo that yields a really nice shorthand version where the “CSQ” trio look awesome blended together and with the rhythm of the matching counterspaces.<span></span> The identity gets a little wonky as it adopts <a href="https://www.charlotterohde.de/typefaces/new-edge-666" target="_blank">New Edge 666 Rounded</a> as its primary typeface and while it looks arguably okay at large sizes and in small doses, experiencing it in smaller sizes and higher doses <a href="https://contentsquare.com/" target="_blank">on their website</a> is low-key appalling. It's not just painful to look at but it's actually difficult to read. The gooey, connecting, rounded-corner approach is extended to the supporting graphics and holding shapes that make things feel more complicated than they need to be. I mean, in principle it's fine and it's properly executed but something about those holding shapes with the type indenting them feels forced and awkward and there are too many lines going in too many directions. Overall, this has a strong foundation in the full and shorthand logos but the identity gets too complicated and makes an already unclear platform more confusing to understand at a quick glance.</p>

<h1 class="friday_likes">Acrónimo by Tuux and Bienal</h1>
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/friday_likes_acronimo.jpg" alt="Acrónimo by Tuux and Bienal" />

<p style="margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;"><a href="https://acronimo.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Acrónimo</a> is a spirit producer in the state of Chihuahua in Mexico, where a specific kind of plant (of the genus Dasylirion) grows in its dessert and is the main ingredient in sotol, one of the two spirits distilled by Acrónimo and the other being gin. If I understand things correctly, the bottle has been designed by Mexico City-based <a href="https://www.tuux.mx/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tuux</a> while the logo and other design elements have been created by Mérida-based <a href="https://bienal.mx/en/home" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bienal</a>. The bottle is pretty amazing, with a rough texture echoing the desert and a large, recessed, smoothed out circle that is to signify a window into the soul… sure, it&#8217;s a little woo-woo but it looks so nice. The bottle also has an indentation that goes all around the squared structure where the label neatly wraps around. Looking like an alien inscription, the logo is groovy and unexpected but also a bold contrast to the minimalist design. A brief behind-the-scenes about the bottle can be found <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DCmaPuhp11I/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a> — so well thought-out. <span class="pagination_divider"></span><span class="small_caps"><a href="https://www.tuux.mx/acronimo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">See full project</a></span></p>

<p style="margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;"><a href="https://aguademadre.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Agua de Madre</a> is a water kefir brand brewed in London, UK. In case you are wondering as I was, here is a description of it in layman&#8217;s terms from Reddit:  “water kefir is a better and more potent probiotic than kombucha. Kombucha is too yeasty. Water kefir can be brewed to contain trillions of CFU of bacteria with minimal yeast.” The packaging, designed by UK-based <a href="https://www.chapbook.cc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chris Chapman</a>, avoids the usual earthy and overly healthy aesthetics of most fermented drinks and instead opts for a more soda-esque and fun vibe with a heavily layered concoction of vintage, slightly cheesy typefaces coming together as if they were stickers haphazardly placed on top of each other. Good for the gut, excellent for the eyes.  <span class="pagination_divider"></span><span class="small_caps"><a href="https://www.chapbook.cc/#aguademadre" target="_blank" rel="noopener">See full project</a></span>

<p style="margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:30px!important;"><a href="https://resibo.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Resibo</a> is a skincare and cosmetics brand based in Świdnica, Poland, that recently launched a new range of <a href="https://resibo.com/product/275-105/shower-gel#/26-scent-misty_road" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shower gels</a> and <a href="https://resibo.com/product/273-102/hand-soap#/26-scent-misty_road" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hand soaps</a>. The packaging, designed by Copenhagen, Denmark-based <a href="https://hugmun.studio/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HUGMUN</a>, starts with another great custom bottle that looks like the facade to an opulent Art Deco building. Looking almost like marble or limestone, with its off-white hue, the tone-on-tone effect that results from the tiered grooves is beautiful. The serif typography — which I am sitting here embarrassingly not remembering its name but that I know deep in my heart that I do know it — is a very unexpected choice that makes the bottle look like a vintage book cover, in the best of ways. The color choices are also spot on, especially the red but I would probably choose the brown one because that combo of sandalwood and fig with smokey notes actually sounds to die for. <span class="pagination_divider"></span><span class="small_caps"><a href="https://www.behance.net/gallery/213838849/RESIBO" target="_blank" rel="noopener">See full project</a></span></p>

                                            <p><strong>Relevant quote</strong><br /><em>At the heart of the new Sandisk logo lies a concept that VP of Creative, Joel Davis, has been long inspired by – the pixel. A fundamental unit of data, the pixel represents the power of creation and expansion. Building around this essential unit of data embeds technology in the Sandisk visual from the jump, anchoring the S letterforms and guiding the width of the letters and shape of the serifs. The modular, almost mechanical feel from the angular pixel base combines with more natural and humanistic curves to weave in the exploratory and ephemeral feeling of inspiration. These also suggest an overall adaptability and versatility: essential traits for a brand that enables mobility and evolves alongside its audiences.<br /><br />Another new feature of Sandisk’s new brand is the logo’s fragmented letterforms. “We wanted the logo to have a sense of openness and invitation,” Davis explained. “The iconic open D and the S both symbolize collaboration and partnerships.” These open, unconnected letterforms invite the viewer to engage with the logo and be part of the conversation. Reimagining key elements like the pixel-driven S creates sturdy, geometric forms that reinforce a sense of precision and immediacy, driving Sandisk’s new definition of future-forward and modern expression. Bringing forward the slab serif and broadening the serif forms themselves uplifts and emphasizes Sandisk’s legacy of industry leadership and powerful foundation through strong typography that reflects the company’s robust and resilient nature.<br /><br />The color palette was another key element in the logo’s rebranding. “While the red isn’t the exact same red, we still felt that maintaining this core color is essential,” says Davis. “It’s a little warmer…we wanted something that feels really immediate and hot.”

                                            <p><strong>Opinion</strong><br />
                                            The old logo was pretty good, with an unconventional choice of a thick-almost-slab serif. I don't think the “nD” ligature was resolved as nicely as possible but it was certainly an improvement <a href="https://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/sandisk_through_a_qa_with_bret.php" target="_blank">over its own predecessor</a> whose funky icon shape also found its way into the tittle of the “i” in the before logo. For a technology consumer product it's actually kind of amazing that the old logo had lasted for 16 years. The new logo is… something.<span></span> I'm trying to approach this with a mind as open as I did with Jaguar and try to embrace the new, almost shocking eccentricity that is embedded into every single letter of this new logo but I have such a guttural negative reaction to it that my efforts may prove futile. I actually really like the shape of the “S” and how it looks like it's inserting itself into the “ground”, perhaps reminiscent of an SD card being pushed into its slot. I could potentially rally behind the shape of the “A” with its futuristic look but the “N” loses me. It's one of the most unsightly letterforms I have seen in some time. It's also hard to ignore the lack of overshoots in the rounded corners of both the “A” and the “N”, especially on the latter, which makes the right stem look like it's stepping over a puddle of water. The “D” remains open but then it's the one letter without the forced slab… seems like it would have been easy to add one poking up from the bottom horizontal stroke. By the time I get to the “K” I'm exhausted of trying to like this. I simply don't. BUT I do applaud the risk they took in doing something so far out of the ordinary.<span></span> The intro videos also hint at a visual language that is actually kind of cool and entertainingly unhinged in an original-<em>TRON</em>-meets-original-<em>Blade Runner</em> kind of way that makes me very curious about how this will be implemented in consumer packaging and other communications as it does have quite a lot of potential. The visual language in the videos is like the long lost offspring of The Designers Republic and Attik, with a heavily layered, pixelated, kinetic energy that feels oddly invigorating at a time when everything else on the market, across all categories, is so overly friendly and approachable. In that context, despite my disdain for its shapes and execution, the logo not only works but I would go as far as saying it slaps.<span></span> Overall, I get the sense that Sandisk didn't have too much to lose — as it is not a tech consumer brand that is top of mind for most consumers like Apple or Samsung or even Logitech — so it could afford to take a big, wild swing and perhaps this drastic approach is an attempt at changing that lack of awareness and position Sandisk as a brand that is ready to face the future and command some more public attention.</p>

                                            <p><a href="https://theatre-senart.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Théâtre Sénart</a> was founded in 1986. In 2015, it moved to a new building designed by Chaix &#038; Morel et Associés. It is situated in Lieusaint which nearly touches the southern edge of Paris. The theatre has two performance spaces, one with 843 seats and the other modular space can hold 383 people seated or almost 1,000 standing. The theatre puts on over 60 shows and more than 200 performances across a wide programme of dance, plays, music, and exhibitions, plus workshops meetings and conferences. Théâtre Sénart belongs to Scène Nationale, an association of 77 &#8220;houses of culture&#8221; spread across France. The theatre recently introduced a new logo and identity designed by Paris, France-based <a href="https://www.grapheine.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Graphéine</a>. The branding update was timed to launch with the 2024 – 25 season and the appointment of a new director.</p>

<span id="more-301456"></span>

<blockquote>
Located in the town of Lieusaint, in one of France&#8217;s largest departments, the Théâtre-Sénart is also in direct proximity to the Carré-Sénart shopping centre. Its communications therefore have to compete on a daily basis with the advertising of multiple commercial brands. The theatre is located in a place that is still in search of an identity, situated between suburbs and open fields, with Disneyland Paris as its main attraction.<br><br>Drawing inspiration from the remarkable building designed by the Chaix &#038; Morel et Associés architecture studio, we wanted to reaffirm and strengthen the institution&#8217;s image by proposing a comprehensive brand toolkit that would identify its status as a major cultural institution in the Paris region.

<p><br>So, the logo. Before or after, it makes no sense until you see <a href="https://www.chaixetmorel.com/en/projects/theatre-de-senart" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the building</a>.

	<figcaption>Brutalism is alive and well on the outskirts of Paris.</figcaption>
	</figure>

<p>As used in the old logo, Gotham and the squares look perfectly at home in <em>that</em> building. The original logo leaned into the brutalism with precision. All the letters align vertically. Even the first &#8220;A&#8221; in &#8220;NATIONALE&#8221; is centred under the &#8220;Â&#8221; in &#8220;THÉÂTRE&#8221;. The main feature of the old logo was the shared &#8220;E&#8221;. (Was there a shortage at the time?) I guess it kind of works, but my eyes keep reading &#8220;HEN SEA&#8221;.</p>

<blockquote>
The previous logotype was a wordmark in two lines composed with the Gotham Bold typeface. It contained several visual quirks, which made it both original and confusing. While developing the new logotype, we wanted to create a symbol that could be isolated and used as a central emblem for all of the communications. This was to create a strong identifier in the urban context of the project.<br><br>We redesigned the wordmark to give the letter ‘A’ a central place in the composition. This new graphic asset, which combines the letter ‘A’ and the ‘pixel circumflex accent’, directly evokes the architecture of the building as well as an abstracted lighthouse. Its ‘pixel’ style is directly inherited from the previous logotype and recalls the building&#8217;s perforated metal cladding. The design of the emblem is intended to be ‘futuristic’ and ‘playful’. The identity encapsulates a sense of escapism that aims to resonate with a young audience.

<p>The redesign job seems to have been &#8220;take all the existing elements of the logo and create something new(ish)&#8221;. I get the feeling that Graphéine wanted to use the available elements to represent not only the building but also the humans that perform inside it. It&#8217;s a heroic effort and comes as close to succeeding as is possible.</p>

	</figure>

<p>The shared letter remains. This time it&#8217;s the &#8220;A&#8221;, which allows the two words to align left. Only it&#8217;s not really an &#8220;A&#8221; or a lighthouse. It&#8217;s more like the spaceship in a video game you&#8217;d play on an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atari_2600" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Atari 2600</a>. I mean that in a good way.</p>

<p>Vertical alignment is abandoned, except at the edges. The &#8220;A&#8221; icon is not vertically centred. &#8220;SCÈNE NATIONALE&#8221; is bigger and the tracking is tighter. Overall, the new logo feels more human to me. The grouping of the letters is cosier and more natural. And perhaps the seats have a little more padding and the staff have started smiling more at the punters. One tiny thing annoys me; the stem of the second &#8220;T&#8221; in Théâtre just ever so slightly doesn&#8217;t align with the left edge of the &#8220;R&#8221; in Sénart.</p>

<p>Does it work though?

<p>Yes. It works because they put it all over their assets and because it improves on the previous version and because once you live with it for a few days and the shock wears off you start to accept it for what it is: brutal but friendly, awkward but cool, pixelated but— <em>Can we stop talking about the logo now? I want to get a drink before the show starts.</em></p>

	<figcaption>Icon over images.</figcaption>
	</figure>

<p>The <s>lighthouse</s> Atari 2600 spaceship icon takes centre stage in this identity. You will see there are three ways to use it: 1) slap it on anything and it looks cool, 2) use the top of the bottom half to define the dividing line in the composition, or 3) use it as a frame for video transitions. One off bonus: turn it into a 3D isometric outline graphic.</p>

<p>The photography is as it should be: dramatic shots of incredibly athletic dancers and people in costumes. The stock photos of skies further down are, I&#8217;m sure, a plea for a bigger photography budget.</p>

	<figcaption>The headline font.</figcaption>
	</figure>

<p>The whole vibe of the identity is theatre poster, even when the assets aren&#8217;t posters. A lot of that vibe comes from the headline font <a href="https://fonts.floriankarsten.com/fk-screamer" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FK Screamer</a>. It&#8217;s tall and exuberant and condensed like a poster font should be. It has good accents, little blocky things, which are essential, because French. It has a welcome lack of ink traps and lovely tapers at the end of some strokes. The &#8220;C&#8221; is particularly nice.</p>

<p>Supporting typographic roles are played by <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Inter" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Inter</a>, the current default font of the universe.</p>

<p>I wasn&#8217;t supplied with an overview of the colour palette. Here&#8217;s what you&#8217;ll see as you scroll. The palette starts with black and a coral-ish orange, it quickly adds purple and yellow and then it doesn&#8217;t stop – blue, green, teal, another green, violet, dusty rose. I get the idea that any colour is allowed as long as it&#8217;s not toooooo saturated. And that&#8217;s going to work fine… in the hands of a capable designer. Fingers crossed.</p>

<p>The stage is set. Before we see how the production comes together, here are a couple examples of the old identity:</p>

	<figcaption>Examples of OLD identity.</figcaption>
	</figure>

<p>The old stuff is not very disciplined. The typography is boring and competes with the photography for attention. It&#8217;s more community theatre than &#8220;major cultural institution&#8221;. Théâtre Sénart needed the update.</p>

<p>On with the show!</p>

<p>The programmes look exactly like theatre programmes. They aren&#8217;t groundbreaking or amazing, but they look nice and they are clear. I know what&#8217;s going on and when. This is the way the whole identity goes. The icon provides the uniqueness. Everything else looks fresh, clean and exactly as expected.</p>

<p>I love the inclusion of the black and white programme. This identity works just fine on a budget.</p>

<p>The posters look exactly like theatre posters. Most of the type is rightly moved off of the photography. The logo at the top of the posters works well, except about half the time when it sits uncomfortably over the photo (see especially the jumping people in underwear). There&#8217;s a lot going on in that mark. It does best on a plain background. Maybe they will tweak the approach for the 2025 – 26 season.</p>

<p>The digital applications carry on the clarity and theatre-ness. They also introduce tilted text in a white box over the event title. It gets a lot of use on their <a href="https://www.instagram.com/theatresenart/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Instagram account</a>.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s the icon looking cool on swag:</p>

<p>In summary, the logo is a warm upgrade \ from the previous mark. The icon makes no sense other than it&#8217;s totally ownable and looks cool anywhere you put it. Everything else looks like a theatre identity. I worry that the all-the-colours approach could get out of control. Altogether, it&#8217;s the right mix of interesting and expected for a theatre in a cool building next to a shopping centre in the suburbs. &#x2605;&#x2605;&#x2605;&#x2605;&#x2606; Would see again.</p>
