                                            <p><strong>Opinion</strong><br />
                                            Although not particularly great in any way, I sort of liked the old logo with the angled type stacked and stuffed into a square, leaving very little unused space, which is my main issue with the new logo as the typography feels too small and oddly placed inside the circle. The shift to lowercase is fine but I don't think much is gained and I feel that — if kept uppercase — there was an opportunity to play with the small circle and the “O” in “VON” instead of the current odd alignment that makes my mouse finger twitch. I'll admit that when the logo is spinning like a vinyl album, the odd placement and sizing pays off as they enhance the spinning-ness of it. The choice of Family Type's <a href="https://familytype.co/#bossa" target="_blank">Bossa</a> helps give the logo some personality but I question if enough of it.<span></span> The identity takes a slightly wild turn with a series of devilish illustrations by <a href="https://www.instagram.com/11v151131_m06/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">11v151131_m06</a> — and no, that was not the cat that I don't have walking over my keyboard, that's their username — that are oddly <a href="https://www.google.com/search?sca_esv=78c2cdce3559d586&amp;sxsrf=AHTn8zqGx-VgvsmROl5cR88c73oLu0bYIA:1737718758218&amp;q=krampus&amp;udm=2&amp;fbs=ABzOT_CWdhQLP1FcmU5B0fn3xuWpA-dk4wpBWOGsoR7DG5zJBtmuEdhfywyzhendkLDnhcoz2MIB1dVLatL09WpR-ccvPDXaR5XXyVwe1f5csG_PdUqD9r59QgllDsBsFeTQ8IyDOmkiuJu4xP6LvjdpMdD8Bl-OoBig_umnxkoh1yPNos2D6Lo6XXlR0y78pOWWZW0e5yTTwxdLAEDOt5zVy_LgFuUcQQ&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjwiLbqoo6LAxVgD1kFHVDzHqkQtKgLegQIExAB&amp;biw=1429&amp;bih=1119&amp;dpr=2" target="_blank">Krampus-esque</a>, which seems like an odd vibe for a techno and house label but, then again, I don't know the first thing about either so these might be spot on. I would love to see more rat-based illustrations, though. Those feel more irreverent and rodents come out at night too, so they seem like more fitting ambassadors than goats with horns.<span></span> The applications are pretty straightforward with just the logo on things and some more Bossa when additional text is needed. The one very nice detail is the standalone circle icon on the album covers. Overall, with a name that translates from German as “Style over Talent”, I wish there was a little more style to this beyond a quirky typeface choice and some strange illustrations implemented somewhat plainly but, granted, this could be someone else's idea of great style so no harsh judgment intended.</p>

                                            <p>A fun combination of clients, typography, and illustration this week, with work from Guadalajara, Milan, and Nicosia.</p>

<h1 class="friday_likes">Velvet by Estudio Cariño</h1>
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/friday_likes_velvet.jpg" alt="Velvet by Estudio Cariño" />

<p style="margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;"><a href="https://www.instagram.com/velvetangelato/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Velvet</a> is a gelato shop in Los Angeles, CA, that offers a selection of velvety-textured and relatively eccentric flavors — eggnog! Nutella cereal! Biscoff Cookie butter! — to enjoy at their small location or take to go in pints. The identity, designed by Guadalajara, México-based <a href="https://estudiocarino.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Estudio Cariño</a>, uses an unexpected source of inspiration — the 1987 Wim Wenders film, <em>Wings of Desire</em> that revolves around two angels in Berlin — which explains (although not that an explanation is needed) the two angels in urban garb that appear throughout the applications in a charming thin-line style. These are paired with a deliciously gooey wordmark that brings the name Velvet to life. Those “e”s… drool. Some additional fun bits of typography — like the secondary Velvet logo and a few other hand-drawn words — add up to a small slice of heaven on Earth. <span class="pagination_divider"></span><span class="small_caps"><a href="https://www.behance.net/gallery/216375077/VELVET-Ice-Cream" target="_blank" rel="noopener">See full project</a></span></p>

<h1 class="friday_likes">Piccolo Seeds by The 6th Creative Studio</h1>
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/friday_likes_piccoloseeds.jpg" alt="Piccolo Seeds by The 6th Creative Studio" />

<p style="margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;"><a href="https://piccoloseeds.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Piccolo Seeds</a>, based in Treviso, Italy, offers a selection of seeds specifically for urban gardens, including vegetables and plants that are perfect for growing in pots, terraces, and small yards. Recently, the company introduced a special collection called <a href="https://piccoloseeds.com/collections/botanical-alphabet" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Botanical Alphabet</a> that features 26 plants with names that range from A to Z as their initials — yes even X, Y, and Z. The packaging, designed by Milan, Italy-based <a href="https://www.the6thmilano.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The 6th Creative Studio</a>, takes the concept to its logical extreme by choosing 26 different typefaces, which could have been deployed out of the box and probably been enough to make these little packets stand out but each letter is treated like an initial cap in an illuminated manuscript and adorned with textures, colors, drop shadows, inlines, and more, all in an amazing 26 different color combinations. The supporting typography and layout on the packets are also excellent, leaving no detail untouched. As a bonus, the packets are made from tomato waste fibers so it can be composted and the little booklet that the packets come in uses paper made from corn waste. <span class="pagination_divider"></span><span class="small_caps"><a href="https://www.the6thmilano.com/portfolio/piccolo-seeds-the-botanical-alphabet/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">See full project</a></span>

<h1 class="friday_likes">Johnny Pep Microfarm by Kleanthis Loizou</h1>
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/friday_likes_johnnypep.jpg" alt="Johnny Pep Microfarm by Kleanthis Loizou" />

<p style="margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:30px!important;"><a href="https://www.instagram.com/johnnypep.microfarm/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Johnny Pep Microfarm</a> is a small brand of hot sauces made from the company&#8217;s own peppers grown in Sia, a picturesque village in Cyprus. The packaging, website, and identity, designed by Nicosia, Cyprus-based <a href="https://www.behance.net/KleanthisLoizou" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kleanthis Loizou</a>, are an explosion of flavor all their own with an endless range of spot illustrations (best experienced on the website), some bold typography, and the hero pepper illustration for the logo. With a menacing facial expression, the logo leaves no doubt that these hot sauces are not messing around. On the packaging, the bright colors and pops of white yield some fun labels that also command attention. The website is worth a browse too, as it&#8217;s peppered with a lot of fun details, great typography throughout, and even some excellent copywriting: “Why have it plain when you can add pain?”. Heck yeah! <span class="pagination_divider"></span><span class="small_caps"><a href="https://www.behance.net/gallery/210243475/Johnny-Pep-Microfarm-BrandingPackaging" target="_blank" rel="noopener">See full project</a></span></p>

Soup Drops will be <a href="http://www.progressosoupdrops.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">available every Thursday</a> (while supplies last, which is not long) during January, which is apparently National Soup Month.

The competition begins with a round robin league phase to qualify for the double-legged knockout rounds, and a single-leg final. It is the most-watched club competition in the world and the third most-watched football competition overall, behind only the UEFA European Championship and the FIFA World Cup. It is one of the most prestigious football tournaments in the world and the most prestigious club competition in European football, played by the national league champions (and, for some nations, one or more runners-up) of their national associations.&#8221; (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Champions_League" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wikipedia</a>)</p>

                                            <p><strong>Relevant quote</strong><br /><em>The new brand identity aims to rejuvenate the brand, while keeping it premium and sophisticated. The primary brand elements — the starball and the Ultimate Stage stadium with the starball roof which are the best known properties among fans — have been renewed with a cohesive and flexible look, ensuring they are still recognisable while also have the capacity to adapt to new expressions.<br /><br />The new brand concept features the iconic starball that has been at the centre of the brand since it was first presented, carefully crafted from glass. The starball looks beautiful, delicate and fragile yet precise and crafted with passion and precision.<br /><br />The new Ultimate Stage is an extension of the starball, bringing the glossy glass look and colour refractions into the architecture. Seamlessly integrated into a gorgeous cityscape, the stadium is an invitation for a prestigious and unique experience of an European match night. The concept extends into vector formats, with new 2D graphics, along with new patterns and vector assets for licensing products appealing to all ages.<br /><br />In line with the concept of distortion and colours as a result of the prism effect, a new asset is introduced; the light wave texture. Waves of light that radiate from the shapes of the starball, colourful, expressive and bold.<br /><br />The concept of colour and refraction has also been applied to the bespoke competition typefaces. A special version has been added to the Champions typeface, Champions Display Refracted which is inspired by the refraction concept and which can partially take on different colours per character.

                                            <p><strong>Opinion</strong><br />
                                            The previous identity by DesignStudio was very well received at the time — SEVEN years ago, jeez — and with good reason, as it had a beautiful execution of the “Ultimate Stage” <a href="https://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/uefa_champions_league_old_stadium.jpg" target="_blank">that had already been in use previously by UEFA Champions League</a> and introduced the “Starball”, all in delectable CGI. This evolution maintains the Starball and Ultimate Stage motifs but updates them with a thicker glass composite that refracts colors on its edges, keeping the overall blue tone that UEFA Champions League is known for but imbuing it with a subtle rainbow of colors. I don't think one is better or more appropriate than the other as both are perfectly well crafted executions of a similar idea <em>but</em> I do favor this new thicker and more colorful glass version. One thing that is interesting is that, while it has more heft to it, it also looks more fragile… like, I could see it falling and shattering, which adds some tension to the Starball's existence. The same thoughts extend to the Ultimate Stage, which now feels more vibrant and like a stronger field force.<span></span> The “Lightwave” graphics are a great new addition that extend the visual language and provide an asset that, while still 3D, is not as voluminous as the Starball or Ultimate Stage and this can be applied in a more “flat” manner over imagery and footage for another lovely refraction effect. The custom typeface is pretty clever and looks great when it's used in multiple colors to mimic the effect of color-on-the-edges from the 3D renders. The single color version is not as awesome but still manages to convey the glass effect. In either variation, the motion behavior of the refracted edges expanding is excellent. Not a whole lot in application but it's easy to see how well this will extend to broadcast graphics and social media promos with such distinctive and engaging assets. Overall, this is a fantastic evolution and while some, validly, might favor the old one, this maintains its essence while providing a new, colorful and vibrant sheen to give the identity a visual lift for the next three years.</p>

<blockquote>
From the discovery phase of the project, it was clear the creation of a symbol was key to unifying the organisation and increasing brand awareness.  But how do you create a symbol of belonging for a condition with over 40 different symptoms? 
<br><br>
Following an intense creative phase, a marque capable of reflecting the  organisation and acting as a symbol of belonging for a condition that cannot be easily summed up was created. 
<br><br>
Inspired by the charity’s past, but built for the here and now, it incorporates the Parkinson’s tulip – an international symbol recognised by Parkinson’s communities  around the world.

<p>The old logo had a strong sense of action and urgency, conveyed through its stencil typeface, which was also mirrored in its visual system. I remember the 2010 identity fondly; it felt refreshing for a charity to be deliberately in-your-face and action-orientated. However, I feel like that era has passed for most charities, as shown by the 2019 refresh. You can see how Parkinson&#8217;s UK began to shift toward a more optimistic and warmer tone, making the previous logo feel somewhat at odds with the new identity. The new logo addresses this shift perfectly, coming across as instantly warmer and more approachable.</p>

<p>The most significant change is the new symbol: a lovely combination of a tulip (the official flower of Parkinson&#8217;s Disease) and the letter &#8220;P&#8221;. The use of the negative space is delightful, and cleverly uses the iconic tulip shape. What I like most is the curve in the stem of the tulip as it exits the &#8220;P&#8221;. It could have easily been straight and standard, but instead it has a bit of drama and a sweeping nature to it that feels truly unique. For me, it has the potential to be an iconic symbol for the charity and its community to rally around. The logotype uses the custom brand typeface &#8211; <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Parkinsans">Parkinsan&#8217;s</a> &#8211; which includes some nice details that reflect the curves of the tulip, such as the &#8220;k&#8221;and descenders of the &#8220;a&#8221; (more on that below). It has a bold-friendliness to it which aptly sets the tone for the rest of the identity.</p>

<blockquote>
To better understand the Parkinson’s community, Red Stone ran workshops and interviews, attended events and visited local branches. More than 1,000 people were consulted throughout the process, to ensure the brand authentically reflects their experiences and challenges.
The concept of making tangible improvements today drove the new proposition – that Parkinson’s UK is the charity ‘Pushing for better. Right here. Right now’.
<br><br>
Making the brand accessible was non-negotiable. Red Stone ensured accessible design drove the creative process. 
Step forward Parkinsans – the new brand typeface for Parkinson’s UK. Approachable, flexible and accessible, Parkinsans defines the brand voice. Taking stylistic references from the marque and the realities of living with Parkinson’s, it is human, energetic, imperfect and sprinkled with unexpected quirks. And as an open source typeface now available on Google Fonts, Parkinsans is truly for everyone.

<p>Undoubtably the hero of the identity is the custom font &#8211; Parkinsans. Amongst the tight ink traps, it&#8217;s a font that manages to juggle a few ideas and quirks pretty successfully; incorporating some of the stylings from the symbol into the letters, as well as injecting some distinction through the &#8220;e&#8221;. On paper you might avoid trying too many ideas but the idea of imperfection and unexpectedness is deliberate and, at least for me, balanced pretty well as it doesn&#8217;t harm readability. All in all it delivers on a bolder and more positive experience, full of personality. I also love how it&#8217;s open source on Google Fonts, nice to see a brand truly living its values.</p>

<p>Complementing the brand font is a true-blue colour palette of a cyan and navy. As well as some friendly brand illustrations to add a bit more heart to the overall package. The continuation of blue makes complete sense from a brand equity point of view, so no qualms there, and I think the navy helps ground the system with a bit more seriousness in places. Illustrations are perfectly fine too, nothing ground-breaking (it&#8217;s hard to be these days in the golden era of brand illustrations), but do add a much needed alternative to imagery and continues with the warmer theme across the identity. Also on show, more so in the applications, is a curved super graphic that adds a nice sense of dynamism to backgrounds. If I were to sum it up succinctly, I&#8217;d say it feels inclusive, friendly, and approachable. Spot on.</p>


<blockquote>
The new brand helps Parkinson’s UK regain its gutsy voice. A new brand personality of ‘relentless doers’ brings energy and directness. A flexible colour palette and adaptable graphic system that empowers rather than inhibits users. And a new approach to illustration enables Parkinson’s UK to tell their story and deal with difficult subjects in a more engaging and relatable way.
<br><br>
Easy to implement and flex, packed full of personality, the refreshed brand embodies a step change for Parkinson’s UK. A brand that’s more visible, more accessible and more relevant. A brand that everyone can access and use. A brand built to help the organisation meet the needs of every Parkinson’s journey. Right here. Right now.

<p>In application it&#8217;s exactly what you&#8217;d expect; caring, cheery, and charming. Big hits of the cyan and messaging grab attention as imagery and illustration provide some friendly storytelling. Here&#8217;s where you see the super graphic adding that final touch to backgrounds as a way of avoiding too much flatness. I&#8217;m also digging how typography is starting to become more dynamic as they play with size; adding some more impact and bounce even when static. It&#8217;s a pretty simple system that has enough tricks in the toolkit to keep things feeling fresh and friendly but never losing impact.</p>

<p>Further on we see more fundraising assets and the digital experience. Important to picture some of these assets on the sides of races or in the street asking for donations and how impactful that blue is in grabbing your attention.</p>

<p class="end">As far as charities go, this does everything you&#8217;d expect it to but done so to a very good standard. I&#8217;ve worked with a few charity organisations and one thing that always came up was how easy would it be to actually implement the brand system we&#8217;d give them? Their resources are often stretched and allocated to the most important places, oddly enough graphic design doesn&#8217;t always rank the highest (crazy, I know). So it&#8217;s great to see that the right amount of energy has been invested in the right parts of the identity to maximise the brand message and really sell its spirit, without getting too complicated for the organisation to actually do. It&#8217;s a bolder and brighter future for Parkinson&#8217;s UK which has plenty to play with in their identity toolkit to keep this brand going strong for years to come, hopefully to outlive Parkinson&#8217;s itself.</p>
