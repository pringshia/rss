We serve bakeries, cafes, hotels and retailers, from large franchises to independent stores. Whatever size you are, we’re straight from the farm and into the cup within hours.&#8221;</p>

                                            <p><strong>Opinion</strong><br />
                                            The old logo was simply the name typeset in a slightly customized version of <a href="https://www.myfonts.com/collections/balboa-font-parkinson?refby=ucllc" target="_blank">Balboa</a>, which I was able to identify because it's the headline typeface used on Freshway's website (and in the new logo). Not much to it, with the name placed inside a rectangle and certainly nothing particularly memorable. The new logo steps into a metaphorical phone booth to change into its superhero version with a more dynamic and high-flying interpretation of the same typography. It's nothing Earth-shattering but the length of the name and the combination of letters — particularly that “WAY” trio where all the angles allow for some sweet nesting — plays out really well in this <a href="https://www.google.com/search?sca_esv=4804c780a61df574&amp;sxsrf=ADLYWIITcWpXj9lhTam0VNd5_MNVZHiLqg:1731506069834&amp;q=Batman+onomatopoeia&amp;udm=2&amp;fbs=AEQNm0A-5VTqs5rweptgTqb6m-Eb3TvVcv4l7eCyod9RtZW9874wvsYjTfpwMQKGHqKPG-IB7j9flyfH28tJSLVuVdcT1tesPpIhTR_8sOQ3FQrQWiVTfWhoIplDgGh5JzUv9F4u3riMB636EHR41DrkNY_uSRk347tLZsVeJqqyuWPTyXrtg-EYkFQYZqw6rWM1khGHS26HrYFGhj2QeE1uCS-2MrLbBw&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwig9N_hutmJAxWJk4kEHfGXMRkQtKgLegQIGxAB&amp;biw=1583&amp;bih=1031&amp;dpr=2" target="_blank">Batman-onomatopoeia</a>-inspired style.<span></span> An accompanying “F” monogram attempts to look like a superhero emblem but it falls short, mostly due to the barebones oval stroke but also because of the awkward proportions of the “F”. More charming and evocative are the spot illustrations that give capes and masks to dairy products although, perhaps, they get a little too cutesy with this being a B2B company as opposed to B2C. In the packaging for their private label — Freshways can also supply other brands — I like how the illustrations occupy the bottom right area of the logo while also being able to land right on top of it as see-through drawings.<span></span> As mentioned, the identity relies on Balboa for most of the messaging but pairs it with the aptly named <a href="https://www.myfonts.com/collections/milk-font-hubert-jocham-type?refby=ucllc" target="_blank">Milk Font</a> to add a splash of dairy-ness. To promote their offerings, some rather nice studio photography has been created in the brand's new pastel color palette and, echoing the spot illustrations, these can be accentuated with black strokes for a comic-book-like effect. Overall, a playful identity that adds some levity to a niché industry that probably gets little to no design attention at all.

Turns out, nobody in Salt Lake City cares about salt or the lake for that matter. So we decided to take a scouting trip to figure out what we were going to base the identity on. It was a good trip where we identified three key references.</p>

<h6>No. 1: The Mountains</h6>

<p>The first thing we noticed is that anywhere you look, wherever you are in the city, you will see mountains. Whether it’s the Wasatch Mountains to the East and North or the Oquirrh Mountains to the West, the mountains are a stunning sight. All times of day, all times of year.</p>

</figure>

<h6>No. 2: The City Grid</h6>

<p>Another element that stood out was the nearly perfect, city-wide grid, which has been in place for literally hundreds of years since Salt Lake City was founded in the 1840s.</p>

<h6>No. 3: Street Car Typography</h6>

<p>Found inside <a href="https://isdup.org/dyn_page.php?pageID=11" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Pioneer Memorial Museum</a>, an 1872 street car used by the city’s transportation system, Salt Lake City Lines (still in operation to this day), caught our attention with its hand-painted lettering because, well, look at it.</p>

<h6>No. 1: The Mountains</h6>

<p>For the mountains, we didn’t want to do anything too literal and just show brown, pointy triangles. We wanted to somehow capture the layering of the different heights and depths of the mountains and how they blend into each other as they intertwine in the background.</p>

<p>In previous years we usually solve challenges like this in digital form first before figuring out how to replicate them in print and/or another physical production method months later but this time it was the opposite as we had an inkling of an idea of how we could abstract the mountains.</p>

<figure class="full">

<figcaption>Early experiments to recreate the mountains.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Our idea was to literally layer mountains by dying paper (and eventually fabric) in hues of brown getting progressively darker, along with a touch of blue for the sky, and leaving some paper free of color to represent snow-capped mountains. Playing with liquid and powdered dyes (and a combination of both) we eventually found a winning formula.</p>

</figure>

<p>We then gave these to our third-time collaborator, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/geo.graphicdesigner/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GEO</a>, and asked him to translate them into a digital asset we could use as the identity’s background. The mountains appear at first peaceful but sudden movements are meant to represent exaggerated tectonic shifts that, while we are no geologists and have no idea whether that statement is scientifically correct, it sounds awesome as a design concept. The motion behaviors in the previous two conferences had been fast-paced and very much in your face so this year we wanted to go to the other end of the spectrum and make the motion of the background slow and moody.</p>

<h6>No. 2 + No. 3: The City Grid + Street Car Typography</h6>

<p>As soon as we had seen the hand-painted typography on the street car we knew it would become the cornerstone of the identity in all its quirky glory. We are not type designers and the sample set of letters was very limited so we also knew we needed reinforcements. Enter <a href="https://xyztype.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">XYZ Type</a>, the type foundry run by Ben Kiel and Jesse Ragan. We reached out to them to see if they would want to take on the challenge of creating a full typeface from a mere 13 sample letters. On top of that we added the challenge that we wanted it to be a monospace typeface because we wanted the typesetting to feel like the city grid on the 1850s map. After some healthy back and forth, <a href="https://xyztype.com/fonts/plumbago" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Plumbago</a> was born. You can read a more in-depth take on the design of the typeface <a href="https://xyztype.com/custom/project/brand_new_conference" target="_blank" rel="noopener">over at XYZ Type’s website</a>.</p>

<p>As usual, we don’t have a formal logo or a single lock-up and this year’s grid approach lended itself to a number of compositions and configurations where no space is left unused and grids within grids are created to place smaller bits of text within the name of the event, replicating the map with each lot singled out within each city block.</p>

<p>The supporting typography is also inspired by the same map and its lovely and meticulously hand-drawn typography. We selected a trio of some of the more normal choices available from Taylor Penton’s hefty collection <a href="https://www.taylorpenton.com/fonts" target="_blank" rel="noopener">of hand-drawn typefaces</a> so as not to distract too much from the primary typeface but still capture that early-settler typography from the nineteenth century.</p>

<h1 class="friday_likes" style="margin: 40px 0 12px;">Website and Social Media</h1>

<p>With all of our digital elements in place, the first task was the website. The previous two years we had used the same structure and bones with different skins and while we tried to do the same for a third time in a row, this year’s visual language demanded its own layout and treatment, especially because, perhaps a little controversially, we elected to do every block of text in a centered arrangement, which might be too much for longer paragraphs but once you center one thing, it’s hard not to center everything else.</p>

</figure>

<p>For Instagram posts, we kept things fairly straightforward with the mountains in the background with different executions of the typography and logo compositions on top. Eagle-eyed viewers might notice some colored gradients in some of the assets below that don&#8217;t repeat again on the website or in the print materials. The reason for that is that, once we started with the physical production, we realized it was going to be a nightmare to get those gradients right consistently, so we abandoned them early on and kept the sky blue at all times, which ended up giving us a simpler color palette for a cleaner look. We also tried a flipboard-train-schedule-like treatment on the typography early on but it wasn’t working either. We could have probably edited the gradients out and not shown the flipboard animations but we put both things in here as they were part of the process to help us get to a more cohesive system.</p>

<h1 class="friday_likes" style="margin: 40px 0 12px;">Opening Titles and Speaker Intros</h1>

<p>For the third year in a row, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/geo.graphicdesigner/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GEO</a> designed the opening titles and speaker introductions based on music custom-made by <a href="https://www.x-tet.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Norbert Herber</a>, who is also back for another round of us providing cryptic art direction that he somehow manages to translate into sweet, sweet music. This year’s prompts for Norbert were: <strong>A)</strong> Trent Reznor (but a happy Trent Reznor), <strong>B)</strong> Ennio Morricone, and <strong>C)</strong> something gospel-y but not too religious. We also provided this doozy: “The tempo should be <em>chill chill chill build up build up BUILD UUUPPPPP chill chill chill build up build up BUILD UUUPPPPP</em> and with each build up, the intensity escalates”. This all led to a combination of the sound of Earth cracking, mountains sprouting from the pits of hell, bells tolling, metal clanking, and enough rumble to shake your innards, all made more amenable by some synth beats. You can never <em>not</em> do right with synth beats.</p>

<p>As usual, we tested our limits (and sanity) with the physical applications as we decided that each of the 1,000 programs, tote bags, and t-shirts were going to be hand-dyed to yield completely unique compositions of mountains and sky, each requiring four separate passes to achieve the layering effect. It took a lot of trial and error to find the right approach and formulas for each item and we ended up doing the bulk of the work in an unexpected environment.</p>

<p>Regarding the “unexpected environment” mentioned in the previous paragraph… long story short: After the 2023 Brand New Conference we decided to purchase a moving truck to help us move all of our finished materials from our headquarters in Bloomington, IN, to wherever the conference might be each year. A tough investment upfront but considering the shipping charges we end up paying each year, we figured we would break even after five years while gaining a lot of flexibility of what we can do in the interim. What we didn’t expect was that the truck would become production central for 2024.</p>

<p>The first item we took on was the cover for the programs. One thing to note at this moment is that, yes, we could have easily created 10, 15, or 20 different compositions digitally and then printed those over and over and save ourselves a huge chunk of time and headache but whenever we encounter what would be the simplest solution to something we run away in the opposite direction.</p>

<h1 class="friday_likes" style="margin: 40px 0 12px;">Tote Bags</h1>

<p>Moving from paper to fabric brought on a slew of challenges as the materials behaved very differently and required different dyes. While the papers were relatively easy to dial in using RIT liquid dyes, the tote bags (and T-shirts) required powdered, reactive dyes, along with a few pre- and post-dying chemicals to, first, prep the fabric for absorbing the dye and then, second, to keep dye from coming off after washing it. Also, they were more difficult to handle because of, well, the handles.</p>

<p>One thing that was very annoying about the bags is that they remained wet for a while and if they even barely touched each other, the dye would transfer from one bag to the other so they couldn’t be hung to dry in the yard first because the wind would make them rub so after dripping them in the truck we had to first put them in the garage for half a day <em>and</em> we had to move one in each hand at a time.</p>

<h1 class="friday_likes" style="margin: 40px 0 12px;">T-shirts</h1>

<p>At first we thought the tote bags would be the hardest but the T-shirts were no walk in the park, especially because now we were dealing with different sizes, so dying an XS T-shirt is a very different experience than an XXL but they all still shared the same process, which started with pre-washing all of the T-shirts with Synthrapol, a chemical that helps lock in the dyes. Washing 1,000 T-shirts is not easy so we headed to our local laundromat to make a first dent in the inventory. (Afterwards we did the rest at home.)</p>

<p>After washing all of the T-shirts after the dying process — each load requiring two passes in the washer before going into the dryer — the “ironing” process for the t-shirts was different. We didn’t use the heat press because that thing is unforgiving and any little wrinkle transforms into a crease that will never flatten so they had to be flattened by hand.</p>

<h1 class="friday_likes" style="margin: 40px 0 12px;">Badges</h1>

<p>For the badges we wanted to take a different approach as to how we would interpret the layering effect in part because we didn&#8217;t want to just repeat what we had already done with the program covers, tote bags, and T-shirts and in part because we needed something sturdy that could last a couple of days of wear and tear. We recreated the layering of the mountains through three different colored papers that were laser-cut to match the mountain peaks, and each layer was printed with the logo lock-up in the exact same place so that the final effect would be the same as on the website and the other materials of having the logo “floating” on top of the mountains and sky with the information of each attendee printed on the “snow” part.</p>

<h1 class="friday_likes" style="margin: 40px 0 12px;">Wristbands</h1>

<p>To speed up the check-in process this year — as it usually requires finding each attendee&#8217;s badge as they arrive — we gave people a wristband so that our staff and the venue&#8217;s staff knew that people had checked-in and they weren&#8217;t just random people coming in from the street. Then they could get their badges anytime after that. The process worked wonders and the wristbands turned out slick. If you need a vendor for these try <a href="https://www.arnettcredentials.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Arnett Credentials</a> — not a paid placement, we are just happy customers who found one good vendor among a confusing amount of online vendors.</p>

<p>This year we couldn’t hang things from the sides of the screen, and to be honest, that’s okay because it is very stressful to hang things from theater stages so we committed to keeping things at ground level, which gave us some more flexibility. Similar to the badges, we took a 3D-layered approach and constructed each letter through five separate layers that, when seen from the front, would look like the mountains and sky in the rest of the applications. We used 2-inch insulation foam to cut the shapes and then we painted them accordingly.</p>

<p>tl;dr: Design is a process.</p>

<p>How do you go “Yes! That’s cool, let’s go down that path” and end up with something that actually looks like something? It’s half leap of faith and half stubbornness to get there. It&#8217;s about trusting the process… even when we actually had no idea what the process WAS. There is no guidebook for stuff like this, so for us the underlying process is to test things and troubleshoot them until as many pain points are removed — not a lot in our case as there is a lot of pain involved — and there is a lot of troubleshooting. We went through STACKS of tests.</p>

<p class="end">More than other years, we took a strong leap of faith with each item as the initial “sketches” were far, FAR from perfect but we could visualize in our mind how they would turn out. We are not by any means implying any of this is the best designed and produced thing ever and we are not looking to pat ourselves on the back. This is more a reminder that design takes time, and iteration, and refinement, and the willingness to shift gears when needed.</p>

Intro video at the link, which gets a little cheesy with the Vibes but the static applications are somewhat encouraging.

                                            <p><strong>Relevant quote</strong><br /><em>In designing The Man Cave brand, we aimed to appeal to a mature audience while communicating clearly with young people. To achieve this, we developed a minimal wordmark and typographic system with a flexibility that suits both demographics.Using all lowercase letters removes hierarchy from the words, while the deliberate closeness of the letters conveys a feeling of connection, a core value of the organisation’s work.<br /><br />In our process, we often explore familiar symbols and reinterpret them in a modern ways to reflect a brand’s meaning. For this project, we drew inspiration from the Indalo man, an ancient symbol from the Bronze Age found in Spain, as well as other early human depictions, to understand the simplicity of form and craft our own symbol. The "Caveboy" icon is composed of three elements: a cave, horizon, and sun, symbolising aspiration and growth. The bent legs of the figure subtly indicate youth, representing a boy who is still growing toward his full potential and underscoring the formative work happening at this stage of life.<br /><br />These elements are brought to life through a vibrant colour palette and a soft, inviting graphic style, creating an approachable aesthetic that resonates across all brand touch points. This approach culminates in the website, serving as the centrepiece of a comprehensive digital overhaul for the brand. The updated site not only enhances the visual experience, but also introduces clear pathways for information, resulting in more engaging and accessible navigation for all audiences.

                                            <p><strong>Opinion</strong><br />
                                            The old logo sacrificed too much in order to align the “A” and “V” across the two lines and not gain a whole lot in either concept or execution, looking more teepee than cave and the equal importance of the up and down arrows didn't quite convey the idea of personal improvement. The negative spaces and counterspaces of the whole thing were just too uncomfortable. The organization also used a pair of antlers as an icon, which, to me at least, were a little confusing. First because it's the kind of decoration that would be in a literal man cave with a huge TV where only sports channels load, a poker table, and Bud Light for days. The bold, thorny antlers to me also had more of an “Alpha male” vibe that seems counterintuitive for what the organization is trying to do.<span></span> The new logo is a fairly drastic and more positive departure. The combination of the name and the new simplified, hieroglyph-like human figure that looks like a modern-day cave drawing feels more in tune with the idea of going back to basics and instilling core foundations in young boys to build character. The built-in meanings into each of the shapes all make sense and are a good backstory as, other than the legs looking like a cave, they are a stretch for anyone to interpret them as shown. Visually, it's a great icon, with its giant head, thick arms, and short legs… you just want to let it hug you. The simplicity of the design using only three shapes is really well executed and makes for a surprisingly rich icon; meaning it doesn't look deadpan or like it's too cool for school… it manages to have some personality and even emotion. Or maybe I'm just projecting some subconscious stuff into it.<span></span> The wordmark, typeset very tightly in Dinamo's <a href="https://abcdinamo.com/typefaces/camera" target="_blank">Camera Plain</a>, looks great both when it's placed in the icon's arms or when used on its own stacked in three lines with equally tight leading. Nothing in application beyond the website, which is sad, as I would have liked to see how else the system could expand. One thing I'm not that fond of is the color palette, which feels a little drab. Overall, it's a solid identity with a great icon as its foundation to help shepherd young boys into a man cave where they can be in as much touch with their emotions as with an 80-inch TV.</p>

It was founded as a state-owned business in 1981 as a project of UNIDO, the United Nations Industrial Development Organization with the goal of kickstarting economic and industrial development in the country and was fully privatized in 2007. With one third of the Mongolian population being nomadic and relying on livestock agriculture for their income, the goat-hair textile has become the third largest export commodity in the nation behind gold and copper. Gobi is Mongolia&#8217;s largest single producer of cashmere, processing around 1,200 tons of textiles annually. Despite expanding its export business to East Asian, European, and American markets, Gobi has maintained all of its cashmere production through a single Ulaanbaatar factory. In October 2024, the company unveiled a new logo and visual identity designed by the San Francisco, CA, office of <a href="https://wearemucho.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mucho</a>.</p>

There are several luxury cashmere companies in the world [&#8230;] They come to Mongolia to harvest the raw cashmere but then take it out of the country, back to the U.S. and Europe to manufacture their products. Therefore taking the money outside of Mongolia.
<br>
<br>
Gobi, however, is working with herders in Mongolia to harvest raw material, it is processed in Mongolia, manufactured in Mongolia, by Mongolians and distributed from Mongolia. As a company Gobi are really giving back to the Mongolian people. This is what makes them unique, and it’s the story we needed to tell and build the Gobi brand around.

<p>I find it difficult to criticize fashion brands, even when they&#8217;re making bad decisions. As attuned as I am to trends in the world of graphic design, whenever I&#8217;m confused by a fashion choice I assume I&#8217;m the one who&#8217;s out of touch. And, perhaps unfairly, the benefit of my doubt bleeds into the branding decisions of fashion companies. Set in Times New Roman Bold Italic with a spur snipped off the “G”, the old logo would be a questionable choice in any other industry. But, for a line of cashmere shirts and sweaters? No-frills, neutral, cozy and familiar? This typographic exploration isn&#8217;t exciting or specific or technically competent, but it doesn&#8217;t <em>not</em> work.</p>

<p>Mercifully, the new logo hews much closer to the familiar world of design trends and is therefore much easier to evaluate. The wordmark is constructed with a gentle flow best seen in the underside of the “G”, but which is also present more subtly in the treatment of the transition from stem to serif. The serifs themselves have a distinct sharpness, especially when contrasted against the icon &#8211; a fluffy knot of hearts that forms something akin to a clover or a ball of yarn. It looks very luxe without betraying the down-to-earth Mongolian farmer messaging that Mucho is attempting to cultivate. Certainly moreso than Times New Roman, anyway.</p>

<p>Speaking of things that aren&#8217;t Times New Roman, Andrea Biggio&#8217;s <a href="https://www.thedesignersfoundry.com/tomato-grotesk" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tomato Grotesk</a> is a high contrast geometric sans serif that matches a lot of the flow of the logo type without knocking it off. It&#8217;s got a quietly quirky quality that has a strong personality when viewed large but reads remarkably clean at body copy scale.</p>

<blockquote>
During our visit to the Chinggis Khaan National Museum in Ulaanbaatar, we noticed a lovely installation high above the doors. Featured was a collection of family brands that they used for branding their livestock, dating back 1000’s of years. There was something so uniquely Mongolian about how these were designed that we were inspired by them to create a set of icons, including 4 unique icons to represent the 4 seasons in Mongolia.

<p>I spent more time than I care to admit trying to identify the glyphs on the Chinggis Khaan Museum as some sort of alphabet before I thought to just check the press release. And I&#8217;m glad they thought to include an explanation of what I was looking at, because the characters don&#8217;t look like any of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mongolian_writing_systems" target="_blank" rel="noopener">eight writing systems used in Mongolia</a> and the <a href="https://chinggismuseum.com/en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">museum website</a> seemingly makes no mention of the fact that it features family livestock brands on the façade.</p>

<p>The snowflake representing winter and the logo&#8217;s icon appear to be original compositions which take inspiration from the design language of the brands. However, the spring flower, summer sun, and autumn leaf are all lifted directly from the museum façade. See if you can spot them all. On the one hand, it lends an authenticity to the Mongolian heritage angle &#8211; this symbolism is very present and prominent in the herding culture of the steppe people. On the other, my grandparents were cattle ranchers and I would certainly have some feelings if I learned that the family brand I consented to share with a national museum wound up being used to sell apparel overseas. As appropriate as it looks, without some much-needed cultural context it&#8217;s hard to gauge how appropriate it is.</p>

<p>Very appropriately for a wool company, the identity gives an overall impression of warmth. The colors have a richness that evokes earth and animal fur and a limited palette that matches the simple solid tones of the clothing line. It must have been a daunting decision to limit the entire palette to just four shades of brown, but the glimpse of photography we see above in the design principles image demonstrates how well brown compliments the dusty blue skies and rich green plains of the Mongolian setting.</p>

<p>Even though it doesn&#8217;t need it, I wish there was more to the justification for the icon construction than 4 hearts = 4 components of the production chain. You can see this style of loop and corner show up in places on the museum wall. While that&#8217;s certainly where a lot of the decision making for this icon came from, if Mucho was going to attempt to ascribe meaning to it I&#8217;d appreciate if they didn&#8217;t stop halfway.</p>

<p>The spacious grassy environments dotted with stoic models make for the perfect backdrops for the softness of the cashmere garments. These look like the kinds of windswept plains where you could really use a sweater. In layouts that aren&#8217;t led by the photography, wool-tone color blocks fill the frame. Copy and symbols float in empty space in the kind of sparse layout that is so common in the visual language of luxury clothing, but which takes on a new layer of meaning here.</p>

<p>The copywriting has the same deadpan tone as the imagery, but it pulls a subtle trick with the <em>Go ___. Be ___.</em> structure seen in a few of the social posts, playing on the phonetics of the Gobi name. Again, it feels a little like a half-measure &#8211; Go bolder.

<p>In an identity that has so far struck an excellent balance between agrarian humility and high luxury, the packaging leans in hard to the luxury vibes. The copper foil is a nice touch of texture on the flat bags, tags, and boxes. Where it clicks is seeing the aggressively plain hang tags lying on the richly textured wool of a shirt, delivering on the contrast that&#8217;s otherwise missing from the rest of the packaging applications. Also of note is the expanded symbol set included on the tissue paper, which borrows even more ancestral livestock brands in a way that I&#8217;m just gonna have to assume at this point is culturally cool and above-board.</p>

<p class="end">As a company, Gobi was created over forty years ago as a concerted effort to bring the national cashmere industry to the world stage. In this recent rebrand, Mucho has managed to utilize the simplicity and spaciousness of the Mongolian character to develop a corporate character that meets global consumers on familiar fashion territory without sacrificing the Mongolian spirit and personality deeply interwoven into the fabric of Gobi&#8217;s cultural identity.</p>
