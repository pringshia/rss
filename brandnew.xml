Split shatters the illusion of timekeeping, stripping it to its unfiltered truth. Unapologetic and resilient, Split doesn’t elevate egos or hide behind gold-plated promises. Instead, it’s a reminder: there’s only the now, no past, no future. Just this moment, this collective journey. Time is what we own, and we owe it to each other to make it count. Every watch tells a story and starts a conversation. For every Split watch sold, we fund an hour of therapy for someone in need, in partnership with Anna Freud.&#8221;</p>

                                            <p><strong>Relevant quote</strong><br /><em>With a personal journey rooted deeply in overcoming trauma and fostering open dialogue, [founder Ed Margulies] envisioned Split as a catalyst for meaningful conversations about mental wellbeing.<br /><br />Our brief was to develop a brand strategy centred on honesty, openness, and genuine human connection. Rejecting typical luxury aesthetics, we crafted a visual identity that features intentionally fractured imagery, physically distorted using ink rollers, scrapers, and scalpels. This distinctive visual treatment symbolises the complexities of individual struggles and the power of shared experiences. Typography and visual elements were chosen to reflect Split's core belief in the strength of vulnerability, pairing tactile authenticity with contemporary elegance.<br /><br />To extend this ethos digitally, we designed and built a website that serves not only as an e-commerce platform but also as a community hub promoting empathy and solidarity. Real-world photography, vibrant yet nuanced, captures authentic moments of human connection, reinforcing the brand’s mission. Each element of the Split Watches identity communicates clearly and powerfully that luxury can be meaningful and watches can be symbols of solidarity and mutual support.

                                            <p><strong>Opinion</strong><br />
                                            In my bingo card of things I would cover on Brand New in my lifetime I never had watch-meets-mental-health brand but here we are and, as such, there is no existing barometer to judge this against, which is perfectly fine… just unexpected. Starting with the name, there is a lot to like here — even if at times it's hard to tell exactly what we are looking at — as “Split” can trigger a few interesting associations: split personality, split-second decisions, split attention, that in one way or another can be related to time. It's also simply a catchy name.<span></span> The logo, in an almost-disappearing rounded serif, accompanied by an asterisk, has a moody, ghostly appearance that is very un-watch-like, which is the first hint that this is an atypical watch brand. The wordmark looks pretty good and I really like how the asterisk icon — chosen, as explained in Split's about page, “because it speaks to the power of adding depth and meaning to a story” — is placed on the left side, further botching conventions. Also love how it's used on the crown of the watch.<span></span> The visual language leans heavy on a blurry effect for both type and image along with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-BJkDyCdw0c" target="_blank">SE7EN-esque</a> motion treatments — it's most certainly a mood, a vibe, and a state of mind. The few applications shown are pretty cool and eye-catching and the tone of voice is poignant to the point where I'm sitting here questioning time and space. Overall, there is a kind of magnetic attraction to it and while it's working on me I also find it a little disconcerting as a medium to sell what are mostly “normal” watches. Meaning not that they are boring watches… they are actually kind of cool… but once you get past the dark, mysterious sheen of the brand and messaging, the product experience is no more different than that of a regular fancy watch. </p>

                                                                    <img src="https://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/wp/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/superside_logo_before_after.png" alt="New Logo and Identity for Superside done In-house" />
                                
                                
                                
                                                                                
                                        
                                            
                                            <p>Established in 2015 as Konsus, <a href="https://www.superside.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Superside</a>, as it was renamed in 2019, is a subscription-based, on-demand creative service that offers access to more than 650 designers, creatives, and artists spread all round the world to large consultancies, corporate strategy teams, investment firms and similar, with need for ongoing support on graphic design, presentation design, and other creative tasks. Its service sits somewhere in the middle of a Venn diagram of hiring a temporary freelancer, ordering a specific task on Fiverr, and having an in-house team as Superside is able to accommodate all sorts of tasks — from polishing PowerPoint presentations to generating social media assets to putting together email campaigns — on short notice and with a quick turnaround. Like many other services, it now also touts its AI-powered production capabilities, which, to be honest, I don&#8217;t know what it means and I&#8217;d rather not find out but with 3,000 projects completed in 2024 I guess it means it can do things fast(er). Recently, Superside introduced a new identity designed in-house.</p>

<span id="more-307263"></span>

<blockquote>Our goal with this rebrand was simple: show how much we’ve grown, and how exciting the work we do has become. Superside isn’t just another agency. We’re not a freelance network either. We’re something different—a creative team&#8217;s creative team.<br /><br />In our rebrand, we wanted to bring all of this to the surface. To show how we’re constantly solving for the gap between technology and talent. And how we see AI not as a replacement for creativity, but as an amplifier—another tool in the hands of great creative minds.<br /><br /> The rebrand was executed in just 6 months—down from the typical years—through AI-driven processes and the input of almost 100 creatives.</blockquote><h3>Superside provided text</h3>

<blockquote>Let’s start with the easy part: The Superside logo isn’t new, but it’s improved! We’ve made subtle tweaks, refining our already iconic logo by condensing the signature Superside squiggle. It’s sharper, sleeker and just as fun—especially now that it’s brought to life with motion design.‎</blockquote><h3><a href="https://www.superside.com/blog/new-brand-has-landed" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Superside blog post</a></h3>

<p>The main hook into this project is the logo evolution not because it&#8217;s the greatest or most revolutionary but it was most definitely needed and the result is sufficiently satisfying. I could have sworn I covered the old logo on Brand New but that wasn&#8217;t the case… maybe it was submitted as a tip and I didn&#8217;t act on it but for some reason that old “S” was filed somewhere deep in my memory as I thought/think the squiggly shape was a rather clever way of representing an “S”. In the new version, the “S” shape is now a little bit clearer while retaining the cropped look that makes it feel as if it&#8217;s part of an infinite loop, although the more I stare at it, the more I think I like the old “S” was more convincing in that respect. The rest of the letters is what makes this a better solution though, with their taller x-height and lighter weight… it just feels better balanced.</p>

<blockquote>Perhaps the biggest change we’ve made is moving away from illustrations and leaning into photorealistic AI imagery. But instead of going the stereotypical AI route of neon colors and whimsical scenarios, we’ve grounded everything in the natural beauty of the world around us.<br /><br />Beyond the artistry, photorealistic AI imagery lets us showcase our design sophistication. Any designer knows that getting humans and nature “right” with AI is challenging. One small mishap can completely dismantle an image.‎</blockquote><h3><a href="https://www.superside.com/blog/new-brand-has-landed" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Superside blog post</a></h3>

<p>As we get into the identity elements and application, the “AI-driven processes and the input of almost 100 creatives” that fueled the redesign start to be felt and I don&#8217;t mean that in the most positive of ways. The new color palette is fine but there is nothing particularly memorable about it; the typeface choices — the free <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Inter+Tight" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Inter Tight</a> and <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Instrument+Serif" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Instrument Serif</a> — are fairly generic; the icon set and spot illustrations beat to their own drum; and the AI imagery… well, no matter how much anyone rationalizes it or philosophizes about it, it looks like AI imagery and while that may be attractive to some of their clients, to me and I&#8217;m guessing most here, it&#8217;s a big turn-off and there is nothing impressive about it. The actual photography is okay but perhaps a little cliché-ish. Props though for getting someone in an actual spacesuit to frolic in an actual beach — I would love to see more of that lo-fi surrealist approach that takes actual creativity and energy to make it happen.</p>

<blockquote>When reimagining our brand, we embraced AI as our primary creative tool. Our team developed a carefully crafted prompt architecture that became the foundation of our new visual identity.<br /><br />The approach was comprehensive, letting us define every conceivable parameter—from image elements and color palettes to subject styling, lighting, shadows and camera angles. The result? High-quality, on-brand imagery that precisely captures our desired tonality, texture and narrative.</blockquote><h3><a href="https://www.superside.com/blog/new-brand-has-landed" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Superside blog post</a></h3>

<p>The applications are highly competent and appropriate but far from unique or distinctive. In fact, I was a little taken aback by how close the visual language — particularly the color combos and mixing of serif and sans serif — is <a href="https://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/new_logo_and_identity_for_fiverr_by_koto.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to Koto&#8217;s Fiverr identity</a>. I&#8217;m not implying they copied it directly but, again, somewhere in the “AI-driven processes and the input of almost 100 creatives” approach, some form of direct or indirect influence may have seeped in.</p>

<p>Their <em><a href="https://www.superside.com/reports/overcommitted-report" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Overcommitted</a></em> digital and print publication is actually quite nice as it displays a slightly more evident input of human art direction and execution so, yeah, do more of that.</p>

<p class="end">I am unsure what the general perception from the design industry at large is towards Superside… it seems like they&#8217;ve picked a lane that isn&#8217;t too damaging to freelancers or small design firms or potential in-house employees as they do fulfill a particular production niche that most designers would rather avoid doing but, just for the record, this post is not any kind of endorsement… it&#8217;s simply just coverage of a design that happened within our/your orbit. Overall, this is a decent evolution that is mostly a reflection of the general, mainstream direction most design is going in at the moment so just like the 2019 Superside redesign involved a lot of Corporate-Memphis-y illustration as the style du jour, this redesign adopts AI imagery (and color palette and typography and layout approach) so, in a way, it&#8217;s an actual embodiment of Superside&#8217;s offering — and I mean this is in the least snarky way possible — which is delivering the status quo, fast.</p>

                                            <p>(Est. 2024, previously Utah Hockey Club) &#8220;The <a href="https://www.nhl.com/utah/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Utah Mammoth</a> are a professional ice hockey team based in Salt Lake City. The team competes in the National Hockey League (NHL) as a member of the Central Division in the Western Conference. The franchise joined the league as an expansion team for the 2024–25 season. The team plays its home games at the Delta Center, an arena they share with the Utah Jazz of the National Basketball Association (NBA). The team played its inaugural season in 2024–25 with the temporary name Utah Hockey Club while a permanent name could be determined. The team&#8217;s name, colors, and jerseys for their inaugural season were revealed on June 13, 2024. After playing a full season under the temporary name, a fan vote led to the permanent name of Utah Mammoth, which was revealed on May 7, 2025.&#8221; (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utah_Mammoth" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wikipedia</a>)</p>

                                            <p><strong>Relevant quote</strong><br /><em>As part of today’s announcement, SEG introduced a full suite of brand elements including the primary logo for the franchise – the Mountain Mammoth – along with secondary marks and the Utah Badge:<br /><br />The Mountain Mammoth logo captures the fierce power of the mammoth mid-charge, tusks up, and ready to attack. Within the mark are nods to the state including the Wasatch Mountain Range and snow-capped peaks that form the beast’s crown; the shape of Utah, which is subtly embedded in the mountain silhouette; and the curved tusk to form a bold “U.”<br /><br />The secondary marks underscore the team’s identity and unwavering pride in the state and include the word “UTAH” with the Mammoth tusk embedded into the “U,” as well as the tusked “U” standing alone as a bold lettermark.<br /><br />The Utah Badge is a classic emblem inspired by the UTAH stairstep design from the franchise’s inaugural season – paying homage to the history of hockey in the state and showcasing the club’s commitment to continuing to grow the game.<br /><br />Accompanying the visual identity is a unique custom-designed typeface, Mammoth Sans, which features a 10-degree forward slant that mirrors Utah’s mountainous terrain and reflects the team’s relentless pursuit of progress. Details like the angled crossbars on the “A” and “H” serve as another visual link to the team’s inaugural lettering system and the steepness of Utah’s highest peaks.

                                            <p><strong>Opinion</strong><br />
                                            Even though it was made clear from the beginning that the old logo was a temporary solution, it still felt a little underwhelming design-wise but that was most likely a strategic move to not let fans get too attached to it and to make the permanent logo pop as a stark contrast when introduced. It worked. Building off of the fun new name — the Mammoth — that was the result of <a href="https://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/its_hockey_oclub_somewhere.php" target="_blank">a public vote pitting eight names</a>, the new primary logo takes the well-worn American sports approach of the angry animal to make something relatively unique and surprising within what appeared to be an extinct art form as more and more professional sports team have adopted hipper, lifestyle-merch-ready logos.<span></span> Cleverly combining a mountain range with the profile of a mammoth, the primary mark is bold, dynamic, and striking with its perfectly executed high-contrast style that places shadows and highlights in just the right places to convey depth while mixing harsh, straight angles with swooping, dramatic curves to shape the mountains and the mammoth. The biggest feat here is making the trunk of the mammoth look streamlined and menacing because, let's face it, pachyderm trunks are the silliest, most adorable thing in the animal kingdom. The eye is also just the right amount of angry and very nicely executed in a way that it doesn't feel empty or robotic.<span></span> The wordmark is pretty good too, with a bold, sort of industrial look to it. In the “UTAH” part of the wordmark, the slanted crossbars of the “A” and “H” offer a nice upward motion when the two letters are together but I feel that when they are separated in “MAMMOTH” those same slants look a little distracting but it's a minor issue. The “U” with a tusk is fun as is the hockey stick inside the shape of the state of Utah with the name staggered top to bottom. The uniforms bring all of the elements together in one patch form or another and they look great in the black, blue, and white configurations. The merch, which drops tomorrow, also <a href="https://ksltv.com/local-news/fans-branding-expert-react-favorably-to-utah-mammoth-name-and-logo/772134/" target="_blank">looks quite promising</a> and with so many elements to play with, I am sure it will be a major hit. The one hiccup in all of this might be the intro video, which gets a little cheesy in narrative and visual execution. Overall, an exciting set of logos in the most traditional form of American sports aesthetics that should strike all the right notes for a nascent fan base that seems ready to embrace its hockey team.</p>

With increased competition and evolving expectations in the online retail space, the platform sought to reposition itself as the most accessible, intuitive option for a new generation of entrepreneurs. To help redefine that positioning and reenergize the brand, Big Cartel partnered with London- and L.A.-based agency <a href="https://how.studio/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">How&amp;How</a> on a comprehensive rebrand. The result includes a new logo and a bold visual and verbal identity, all aimed at helping creative founders turn their ideas into income.</p>

There’s a great fallacy in business that all you need is a plan. A plan will see you through, dissolving any fear in your path and paving the way to untold glory. A plan will see you succeed. Well, after two decades in the game, Big Cartel has realised the truth is anything but. And it’s why, with a growing selection of affordable plans and intuitive tools, it’s giving founders a running start rather than a run for their money. All it needed next was a brand capable of convincing people it really is that simple.
<br /><br />
More than a new look, How&#038;How provided Big Cartel with a new lease of life. By breaking down the barriers to getting started, the brand agency positioned it as the go-to for entrepreneurs taking the leap. Now, no dream will ever be deemed too weird, too wild, too big or too small to work – and the brand backs that up.
<br /><br />
Every piece comes together in a world as self-made as those it represents. And the cherry on top? A rabble-rousing, re-thought logo that carries 20 years of noughties goodwill into today, and proves that you don’t have to be picture-perfect to get your creation on the internet.

<figcaption>Logo.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Big Cartel’s previous identity revolved around a logomark known as “The Fletch” — a sharp, chevron-like symbol inspired by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fletching" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fletching,</a> the fins or vanes on an arrow, each individually known as a <em>fletch.</em> While not immediately intuitive — and possibly not even intended — it gives off vibes of precision, direction, and aiming for sales targets. Its shape could also be interpreted as a shield or badge — digital shorthand for trust, credibility, and protection — which makes sense in the context of an e-commerce platform. With a single notch cut out of the right side to suggest a gap in feathers, the mark could even be seen as a very — and I mean <em>VERY</em> — abstract combination of “b” and “c” letterforms. But that&#8217;s probably just me post-rationalizing and giving this thing too much credit. All in all, though, it’s a pretty solid mark.</p>

<p>The logotype, however, didn’t hold up as well. Over-customized and inconsistent, it featured a mashup of conflicting styles: slab serifs and loopy tails, a clunky “c-a-r” ligature, a “t” with an out-of-place angled ascender, and a “g” with no ear that left its bowl looking strangely hollow. The whole thing felt like a collision of three or four different typefaces, stitched together in a way that didn’t quite work. The one-word construction of “bigcartel” added to the visual friction, creating an awkward rhythm that was hard to read and harder to love. It was a product of its time — early-2000s digital branding at its most eager — but ultimately, it lacked cohesion and clarity.</p>

<p>The new logo makes one smart move right out of the gate: it separates “Big” and “Cartel” into two distinct words, immediately improving legibility and restoring some semantic clarity. The logotype is built from a customized version of <a href="https://extraset.ch/typefaces/es-replan-variform/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ES Replan Variform</a> by <a href="https://extraset.ch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Extraset</a> — specifically the “Regular 1” variant, thickened into a chonky custom “Black” weight for this application. It’s a geometric sans with character, featuring eccentric touches like squared-off terminals on the spur of the “G” and the legs of the “A” and “R.” These quirks give the type a slightly offbeat, imperfect quality that reinforces the brand’s ethos of scrappiness, individuality, and anti-polish, though not without trade-offs. While the squared legs of the “A” preemptively solve <em>The Kerning Nightmare That Could Have Been</em> between the “C” and “R,” the squared-off “R” leg actually introduces <em>The Kerning Problem That Never Was But Now Is</em> between the “R&#8221; and “T” — which is why “R” legs typically extend past the bowl. And the squared-off spur on the “G,” while conceptually interesting, edges dangerously close to looking like a mistake at smaller sizes.</p>

<p>But the logo’s real magic comes from the reimagining of the Fletch mark. No longer a single, static symbol, it&#8217;s now a flexible, hand-drawn character — meant to resemble a doodle from a maker&#8217;s sketchbook — that lives between “Big” and “Cartel.” In its default form, it’s a playful sketch, full of personality and imperfection, with just enough visual echo of the original mark to maintain continuity. And because this symbol can be swapped out for a wide array of similarly styled illustrations, it transforms the logo into a modular container for creativity. It’s the juxtaposition of rigid geometry and human spontaneity that gives the new mark its depth and distinction. Rather than aiming for perfection, it celebrates personality, and that feels exactly right for a brand built to serve makers.</p>

<blockquote>
The identity itself is a real scrapper. The central illustration style – inspired by the ideas entrepreneurs scribble into notebooks – hits that bang on the nose, establishing a free-spirited tone the rest of the elements aspire to. Whether it’s the punchy voice that motivates members to market their wares or the headline style that cuts through any doubt. The risograph textures which speak to the indie roots of Big Cartel or the rich bank of colours which herald its new point of difference.

<p>The strength of Big Cartel’s new identity lies in how well it scales — not just across mediums, but across moods. It’s a system that flexes between structure and spontaneity, geometric rigor and handmade charm, flair and intentionality. At its core is a grounded color palette of cream, black, and stippled gray, accented by hits of high-energy color: cyan, tennis ball green, punchy purples, rich burgundy, and deep greens. The neutrals give it structure. The accents give it soul.</p>

<p>Typography plays a central role in reinforcing the brand’s personality, working in tandem with every other element in the system. Primary headlines are set in <a href="https://extraset.ch/typefaces/es-replan-variform/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ES Replan Variform</a>, a reverse-stress sans serif variant that embraces its quirks with unapologetic flair. For subheads and UI elements, Replan Variform Regular 1 offers a more restrained, geometric foundation. And for body copy, Dinamo’s <a href="https://abcdinamo.com/typefaces/marist" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Marist</a> — a contemporary serif rooted in historical forms — adds warmth and literary texture, bridging digital clarity with analog heart.</p>

<p>Illustration reinforces the system’s maker-first mindset. Clean, geometric, pictogram-style icons are softened with risograph-inspired textures, grounding the otherwise digital-native aesthetic in tactile imperfection. Hand-drawn “stickers” — expressive, sketchy visual elements that echo the reimagined Fletch — serve as both alternate brand marks and layout embellishments. And they also inform the aesthetic direction of more hero-based illustrations that you&#8217;ll see further down in the review. These whimsical, rough-around-the-edges <em>illicons,</em> as I like to call them, help to reinforce Big Cartel’s message that there’s no wrong way to make something.</p>

<p>And I just love the lockups: smart, modular compositions that stitch everything together. Whether it’s a type-heavy layout, a symbol-forward moment, or a playful combo of both, the system delivers a toolkit that feels cohesive without being predictable. It’s adaptable, intentional, and definitely made for makers.</p>

<p>Photography has a presence, too, in the form of that trendy, hard-flash, point-and-shoot aesthetic that’s been everywhere lately. To many of us Brand New Stans, seeing yet another use of this style might elicit an eye roll or 20, but I think it works when done right, and for Big Cartel, it is. The shots feel candid, unpolished, and full of character — like old Polaroids pulled out of someone&#8217;s bedside table drawer that smells like cigarettes and/or weed, and spilled PBR and/or Jack Daniel&#8217;s. They celebrate the humans behind the goods in all their eccentric glory, reinforcing the brand’s lo-fi, no-filter ethos without feeling derivative or overly art-directed.</p>

<figcaption>OOH advertising, and a person who&#8217;s probably not a maker not paying attention to it.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The verbal identity is just as dialed-in as the visual one, and as someone who values copywriting as every bit as critical to branding as design, I really appreciate How&#038;How’s attention to narrative and the way it shapes the overall voice and tone of this system. Messaging leans hard into empowerment without ever feeling preachy or saccharine. Lines like “It’s only dumb until you do it,” “Sell your stuff, not your soul,” and “Sell out without selling out” strike a perfect balance of cleverness and sincerity, capturing the voice of the skeptical-but-driven maker. It’s the kind of writing that sounds like your smart, creative friend — the one who finally started their online store and wants you to start yours too.</p>

<p>Visually, the advertising system is where all the ingredients get to mix — type, color, stickers, illustrations, risograph texture — but always with a sense of control. There’s plenty to play with, but the restraint in layout and pacing keeps everything feeling intentional. The expressive headlines, set in ES Replan Variform Medium, land with real presence, while small supporting elements — like sticker-style icons or rough-edged drawings — help tell the story without overwhelming it. There’s a clarity to the messaging, both in tone and in composition, that lets the brand’s voice and values shine through.</p>

<figcaption>More UI components, including some snappy branded merch.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Much like the advertising system, the website shows off just how flexible — and well-balanced — this identity really is. From desktop to mobile, layouts layer brand elements with intention: expressive typography, hand-drawn illustrations, geometric icons, and risograph textures all show up, but never all at once, and never without purpose. There’s an editorial sensibility to the pacing: whitespace is used generously, colors pop in smart moments, and nothing feels crowded or forced.</p>

<p>The base color palette (cream, black, and stippled gray) sets a clean, understated foundation, allowing accent colors to punctuate key UI moments without overwhelming the experience. Type is used with discipline: Replan Variform Medium headlines bring a bit of punch, Regular 1 keeps buttons and subheads feeling tidy, and Marist adds warmth and legibility to longer content blocks. Even in the most utilitarian corners of the site, the brand’s personality still comes through — in iconography, in micro-interactions, in the occasional sticker or sketched shape that shows up in the margins. It’s the kind of design that makes space for creativity, without getting in the way of commerce.</p>

<p>Social and merch act as natural extensions of the system: additional canvases for the same mix of punchy messaging, expressive type, and flexible visuals. From notable totables to scroll-stopping social posts, every touchpoint carries the same confident voice and indie spirit. The sizzle reel ties it all together: a rapid-fire showcase of just how many ways this identity can move, stretch, and adapt without ever losing its personality. It’s proof of a system that’s not only robust, but ready to work.</p>

<p>What How&#038;How has built for Big Cartel is more than just a rebrand. It’s a <em>recalibration</em> that honors the platform’s roots while opening up space for a new generation of makers. Every component — from the logo to the layout system, from the type to the tone of voice — feels intentional, adaptable, and unmistakably self-made. It’s a brand identity that doesn’t just sell the product — it sells the mindset behind it.</p>

<p class="end">And in that sense, it doesn’t just make sense — it makes (lotsa) cents.</p>
