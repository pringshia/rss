Our network works in more than 200 communities and over 90 countries to deliver change through football to young people. With decades of work in the field of football for good, we have seen that real, transformative impact is possible, through the shared joy that football brings.&#8221;</p>

                                            <p><strong>Relevant quote</strong><br /><em>Barkas delivered a refreshed creative position, a rallying brand narrative communicating that the time for change is now, and a new visual and verbal identity — all rolled out across a wide range of digital and physical touchpoints. The new brand reflects the scale and diversity of the global football community, while acknowledging the ever closer relationship between sport, culture and lifestyle in our world today.<br /><br />The brand narrative and identity Barkas developed balanced an inclusive and celebratory humanity with the energetic, edgy language of football. A defiant, characterful font inspired by protest posters was combined with a joyful colour palette and a hand-drawn logo that inspired the supporting iconography. The new identity is designed for everyone to share and enjoy. By injecting more positivity and warmth, culture has become an inherent part of Common Goal’s identity — brought to life through dynamic and emotive art direction.

                                            <p><strong>Opinion</strong><br />
                                            The old logo was okay… there was a slightly clever idea in the “MM” ligature representing “having something in common” or “joining forces” or some other well-meaning intention. The rounded, geometric sans serif approach was perhaps a little too informal and playful for the more serious undertaking of the organization but, in principle, it was a serviceable logo. The new logo introduces a fantastic icon of two people chasing a soccer ball — a metaphorical <em>common goal</em> if you will — and revealing a heart in the negative space of their bodies. The amount of warm-and-fuzzy interpretations anyone can derive from the icon are endless. The execution is so good too, with a wobbly, hand-drawn aesthetic that adds yet another human touch to an already touchingly-human icon. I can't say enough good things about it. It's so great.<span></span> The wordmark and headline typography uses a no-nonsense, bold, condensed sans serif that helps offset and contrast the hand-drawn icon. It starts to feel a little too lifeless at times but the typeface does have enough subtle quirks — like the large period mark or the funky “W” — to keep it interesting and the feel-good photography helps soften the tone. The icon set in a hand-drawn aesthetic that matches the icon is excellent although, as of yet, remains unused in the identity samples or the website (where some other generic icons are still in play). Overall, this arms Common Goal with a bold, confident identity that emphasizes their force-for-good outlook on how far soccer, collaboration, and a little bit of heart can go.</p>

<h1 class="friday_likes">27/4 by Yorgo&amp;Co</h1>
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/friday_likes_274paris.jpg" alt="27/4 by Yorgo&amp;Co" />

<p style="margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;"><a href="https://www.27quatre.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">27/4</a> is a quadruple-threat of gastronomy and entertainment offering a sake bar, a Michelin-starred sushi counter, a tea ceremony capsule, and a secret karaoke lounge, all from inside a stunning, futuristic three-story building in Paris, France. The identity, designed by local firm <a href="https://www.yorgo.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Yorgo&amp;Co</a>, takes a cue from the octagonal window on the facade and the shape of the first floor&#8217;s room&#8217;s ceiling and walls to create an octagon-laden visual language that extends from logo to custom type to signage to menu to even a cat-like mascot. While the premise could be too much of a good thing, the elegance and high-end production of all of the materials offers the right amount of restraint before getting too gimmicky. The simplicity of the typography lends itself perfectly for all the different executions, whether it&#8217;s etched in metal, extruded in wood, or embossed on paper. Just stunning all around. <span class="pagination_divider"></span><span class="small_caps"><a href="https://www.yorgo.co/work_client_27-4_visual-identity-and-signage-342" target="_blank" rel="noopener">See full project</a></span></p>

<h1 class="friday_likes">Mr. Sushi by After</h1>
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/friday_likes_mrsushi.jpg" alt="Mr. Sushi by After" />

<p style="margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;"><a href="https://www.mrsushiperu.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mr. Sushi</a> is a chain of quick-service sushi restaurants in Peru that has been around since the 1990s. The new identity, designed by Lima, Peru-based <a href="https://after.pe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">After</a> (in 2023), introduces a charming cat mascot as its icon that looks as if it could be a maki of its own, all bundled up in a cozy seaweed blanket. Actually that sounds kind of disturbing — a cat in seaweed — but you get my point. I hope. The cat comes with a few different facial expressions that have a cool, manga vibe and the rest of the identity continues to lean on Japanese cues with its various Rising-Sun-like graphics. (It&#8217;s also worth pointing out how generic <a href="https://after.pe/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/COMPARACION-1-2500x1667.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the old logo was</a> and I can&#8217;t imagine the identity around it was any better.) The accompanying wordmark, in an extra chunky design pairs really well with the icon and the headline serif used throughout is a great, unexpected addition — I love the generous use of “M”s to fill in the space. Before you move on to the next project, skimming through <a href="https://www.instagram.com/mrsushi.peru/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">their Instagram account</a> is quite enjoyable to see how the brand has evolved and been applied since it was introduced. <span class="pagination_divider"></span><span class="small_caps"><a href="https://after.pe/antes-despues/mr-sushi/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">See full project</a></span>

<h1 class="friday_likes">Carmel by FAENA Studio</h1>
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/friday_likes_carmel.jpg" alt="Carmel by FAENA Studio" />

<p style="margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:30px!important;"><a href="https://www.instagram.com/carmel.cdmx/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Carmel</a> is a tapas bar in Mexico City that recreates the experience of eating said tapas (and drinking as yet unsaid vermouth) in the streets of Barcelona but with a Mexican twist where possible. The identity, designed by local firm <a href="https://faena-studio.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FAENA Studio</a>, is as hip, as nonchalant, and as too-cool-for-school as the restaurant is… and while that could be misconstrued as a diss, the restaurant does appear to do all of this authentically by doing things their own way. A deadpan sans serif serves as the primary logo, which is bluntly displayed on the entrance in a no-frills sign while the same typeface in the same barebones style adorns the plates. A handful of corny and clichéd typefaces and awkward frames and borders make sporadic appearances, adding a sense of controlled chaos that seems fitting for the bustling restaurant. A bird icon that appears to be random is inspired by the owner&#8217;s childhood, where a bar near his house hosted goldfinch singing competitions. They had me at tapas. <span class="pagination_divider"></span><span class="small_caps"><a href="https://www.behance.net/gallery/209877899/Carmel" target="_blank" rel="noopener">See full project</a></span></p>

                                            <p><strong>Relevant quote</strong><br /><em>How do you reimagine the beloved but often overlooked veggie, honoring a century of farming legacy while appealing to modern consumers? By crafting a brand identity that bridges past and future, celebrating the humble carrot’s versatility and timeless appeal.<br /><br />Bolthouse Fresh’s new retro-modern brand and packaging design tells a compelling story of continuity and innovation. We maintained the essence of the iconic blue from the legacy brand, pairing with a vibrant, future-forward color palette. Custom illustrations and an approachable, playful tone pay homage to the brand’s agricultural roots while adding a contemporary twist.<br /><br />Each element of the design works in harmony to convey core values of freshness, trust, and quality that have defined Bolthouse for generations. The result is a bold, intuitive aesthetic that embodies both tradition and progress, redefining how a classic brand can captivate today’s health-conscious consumers in the ever-evolving produce aisle.

                                            <p><strong>Opinion</strong><br />
                                            The old logo may seem familiar to some Brand New readers <a href="https://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/new_logo_and_packaging_for_bolthouse_farms.php" target="_blank">as it was Spotted last year</a>. I even received a couple of tips saying that Bolthouse Farms had rebranded once again but the reality is that Butterfly, the parent company of Bolthouse Farms, decided to split the company into two, so “Bolthouse” now exists as both <a href="https://www.bolthouse.com/" target="_blank">Bolthouse Farms</a> and <a href="https://www.bolthousefresh.com/" target="_blank">Bolthouse Fresh</a>, which is not confusing at all. Back to the design though… the old logo was fine, in a generic-sort-of-way that signaled fresh-produce-from-a-farm-! but it was also fairly dated with its calligraphic script.<span></span> The new logo is a drastic departure that creates some very beneficial distance from both the old logo and the new Bolthouse <em>Farms</em> logo, with a bold, playful, and energetic wordmark. The chiseled flaring look is pretty cool and unexpected while also helping the carrot in the counterspace of the “O” feel really well integrated with its tapered contour. Even the leaves, which could have been somewhat cheesy work effortlessly and the asymmetry it creates makes for a more engaging wordmark.<span></span> The packaging is solid… well, I mean, it's transparent but it's a solid, simple design that highlights the carrots within with the blue logo as a bold accent on top of them with some charming holding shapes holding all of the elements together. The ingredient illustrations are great, with their grainy textures and simple design that gives them enough personality without going overboard and making them all wacky. I would never choose it for anything but the supporting typeface throughout the project, <a href="https://www.myfonts.com/collections/alber-new-font-moretype?refby=ucllc" target="_blank">Alber New</a>, works really well to sprinkle some additional personality to the brand. As common as it is, the hard flash, highly saturated photography is actually quite appropriate for this, making the carrots look extra crunchy, extra yummy, and extra orange. Overall, while there is nothing groundbreaking or even out of the ordinary here, this is the most excited I've ever been about carrots and the most invested in thinking about how they are branded and marketed, so on a scale from zero to crunch, I think this ranks as high as it gets for this category.</p>

Part of what makes it so exciting is that Grand Prix motorcycles are purpose-built racing machines that are unavailable for purchase by the general public and unable to be ridden legally on public roads, so they are… fast, with riders reaching speeds of 362 km/h (approximately 225 mph). The MotoGP championship is divided into several classes: MotoGP, Moto2, and Moto3, each with bikes of different levels of horsepower and weight and in 2019, MotoE, featuring all-electric motorcycles was introduced. Recently, MotoGP introduced a new identity designed by London, UK-based <a href="https://www.pentagram.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pentagram</a> partner Angus Hyland.</p>

<blockquote>Research revealed that the MotoGP brand was able to evolve on multiple fronts. The current fan base is highly loyal, but the sport wishes to expand. To do so, MotoGP needed a better understanding of each facet of its audience and more effective ways to engage them, as well as strategies to reach new fans across different geographies and cultures. It also needed to tell a single, cohesive brand story that truly fits “the most exciting sport on earth.”<br /><br />The existing branding, which evolved over many years, no longer reflected the core of the sport today. While the logo retained brand equity and recognition, it lacked visual clarity, especially in digital environments. Over time, the sub-brands had also become less recognisably related to the core identity.</blockquote><h3><a href="https://www.pentagram.com/work/motogp/story" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pentagram project page</a></h3>

<blockquote>At the centre of the MotoGP universe, the new logo is directly inspired by the sport itself, taking its rounded form from the lean of the riders as they go around corners at incredible speeds—something which is unique to the track-based nature of the sport. This lean is reflected in the letter ‘M’; the ‘O’s suggest the wheels&#8217; geometry, with the ‘t’ representing the rider between them. The ‘GP’ evokes the track and helps the logo retain a strong, sporty aesthetic.</blockquote><h3><a href="https://www.pentagram.com/work/motogp/story" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pentagram project page</a></h3>

<p>I don&#8217;t follow this sport at all so I would have been hard-pressed to recall what the logo for it is, which I mention to establish that I have no emotional connection to the old logo (or this specific organization or sport) which I bring up because the tips I received about it were… passionate. The old logo had a lot going on with what I assume was an abstracted checkered racing flag (or the long lost sibling <a href="https://www.bahamas.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">of the Bahamas logo</a>) that overpowered a heavily slanted, condensed wordmark, all with softened rounded corners as an evolution of its predecessor (which was cooler). Despite the awkward proportions of graphic-to-name, it was a good logo in that it was easily identifiable for its contour, bold shapes, and color contrast.</p>

<p>The new logo abandons the checkered flag, which is an arguable decision… I think it could have been evolved into a smaller detail or accompanying, standalone mark but, on the other hand, leaving it behind does allow for the name to stand on its own and take up more space wherever it&#8217;s used. The resulting wordmark is technically fine in that it&#8217;s readable, it has the implied speed of the sport through the slanted “M”, it works in a single color, and it reproduces better at small sizes but it also feels like it has one too many ideas and styles going on. There is an evident geometric approach and construction to all of the elements but even then, the “M” feels like it&#8217;s doing one thing, the “oto” part something else, and the “GP” is having a party of its own. The latter element is probably what makes this logo feel so strange because it ends up being such a strong, contrasting visual that it almost looks like an interim merger logo where “Moto” and “GP” were existing marks and had to room together moving forward. To its credit, there is actually a valid reasoning to this contrast…</p>

<figcaption>Sub-brands.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Having a purposely distinct execution for “GP” (short for Grand Prix) helps the brand architecture establish a bolder visual separation between the organization&#8217;s different bike classes — Moto2, Moto3, and MotoE — with their respective power and weight restrictions. Within this context, the very different treatment of the second part of the name, allows for the “GP”, “2”, “3”, and “E” to have their own cohesive language. The previous solution to the class sub-brands was fine and it worked but I do think this new approach is a more interesting and engaging system that appears to have more intention in creating a cohesive family of logos with more flair.</p> 

<blockquote>The visual elements are directly inspired by the sport’s incredible speed and energy. During events, the bikes often blur into a mix of colour and sound as they speed past. This motion, along with the shifting directions and seemingly impossible angles of riders as they take corners, is mirrored in the animated brand elements, creating a series of energetic, vibrant, and adaptable brand moments.</blockquote><h3><a href="https://www.pentagram.com/work/motogp/story" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pentagram project page</a></h3>

</figure>

<p>This one motion treatment in the background is quite nice as it does convincingly evoke the feeling of bikes zooming by around a corner. In other static and motion applications there is also the treatment of the single line of vertical pixels extended endlessly, which cheapens the identity a bit as it&#8217;s an overused technique.</p>

<blockquote>The team’s approach to colour was to keep the masterbrand neutral, sitting outside the rainbow of different colours of the teams, sponsors and track environments. This allows the main MotoGP brand to work alongside any colour combination, giving flexibility and longevity for future seasons. Rather than defining static fixed colour values, different sections of the colour wheel were assigned to the different business areas and sub-brands.</blockquote><h3><a href="https://www.pentagram.com/work/motogp/story" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pentagram project page</a></h3>

<p>The new typeface is technically great and well done but, try as I might, it&#8217;s nearly impossible to not compare this to the one introduced <a href="https://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/new_logo_for_formula_1_by_wieden_kennedy.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in the Formula 1 identity</a> in 2017. Given that MotoGP exists within the same realm of machines going at insane speeds around tracks, it seems like an oversight to design a typeface that is so similar in look-and-feel. Certainly, F1 doesn&#8217;t “own” the style and it would be akin to saying corporations in the same industry can not both use, say, neo-grotesque sans serifs but, yeah, they did this same thing first. Nonetheless, it&#8217;s a slick variable typeface with some groovy ligatures and it&#8217;s perfectly fitting for the sport.</p>

<p class="end">The applications are all mostly fine. Nothing stands out as overly exciting or innovative. The blurry backgrounds and other textures start to feel a little cheesy and dated. The generic photography doesn&#8217;t help either — I think this identity was screaming for some kind of cool photo treatment and one of those fancy generators instead of just some silhouetted people in front of Photoshop effects. Visiting MotoGP&#8217;s website, the new logo and typeface do come together nicely to present a bold and speedy-looking brand and browsing through their most recent social posts, a more purposeful and engaging visual language does begin to reveal itself. Overall, the identity is all technically fine if perhaps somewhat disjointed at times with one too many directions and treatments that, at least for now, don&#8217;t quite come together as convincingly as they should for such a high-stakes organization.</p>
