Already a burgeoning tech and arts hub, the creative district along Great Northern Way is home to Emily Carr University of Art + Design, Vancouver Community College, and the Centre for Digital Media. The area has attracted innovative brands like Electronic Arts, Samsung, Lululemon, as well as Nemesis Coffee, Red Truck Brewing, Nature’s Path, and startups that understand that work—and life beyond it—should be collaborative, inspiring, and creative. This mixed-use area is directly on rapid transit that will connect the western Seawall to East Vancouver’s eclectic neighbourhoods like Commercial Drive, offering a connected epicentre for the city’s flourishing creative economy. In addition to post-secondary institutions, new rental housing, grocery and retail spaces, amenities, and public art, industries like game production, film special effects, fashion, graphics, and other creative fields will thrive here.&#8221;</p>

                                            <p><strong>Relevant quote</strong><br /><em>The district was already home to Emily Carr Institute of Art and Design, Centre for Digital Media, Electronic Arts, lululemon and many more creative businesses. We helped create a unifying story and shape its unique role in the city: to be the global home and local champion of Vancouver’s creative innovation. With this distinctive combination of technology and creative flair, South Flats becomes the place for ‘imagination applied’.<br /><br />The brief was to evolve the South Flats brand into an ambitious identity that puts this district on the map. We needed to find the right tone to appeal to the creative innovation community: future-facing not juvenile, sophisticated not cheesy, welcoming not high-brow. The result is a brand of depth and dimension. It shows how art and technology can transport you, immersing you into new worlds. Playful in its perspective shifts, it speaks to a mindset of finding a different point of view.<br /><br />Our chosen palette is a burst of colour in a grey city. The cherry red — derived from South Flats’ sculptural pavilion — is paired with fresher greens, blues and pinks for greater stand-out. Bold typography opens up like a script, revealing the characters and stories that make this place unique. We show collections of imagery that fill and expand beyond the page, symbolising the way this place stretches our imaginations. With this identity, South Flats adds new dimension to Vancouver’s story, inviting the world to discover its creative side.

                                            <p><strong>Opinion</strong><br />
                                            The old logo was crazy, cooky, wacky, and quirky, all while sporting — with a straight face no less — a “z” at the end of “flats” like if it were a 1990s energy drink. It was actually <em>not</em> bad, conveying a sense of urban density and energy but the “z” really made it hard to take the logo (or the district) seriously. Along with a normal “s” in the name, the new logo tempers the crazy perspective planes of the old one with a single shift in perspective now running along the middle that, while not as exciting as before, is satisfying in its symmetry as the two words now occupy the same amount of space and there is also a very pleasing detail of the two “S”s book-ending the wordmark. It's not the most amazing or exciting logo but it's the equivalent of the old logo adulting. Not sure how tight the guidelines and usage are to always show the logo with “VANCOUVER” underneath but I would say it's a good idea to use it as much as possible and establish a connection between South Flats and Vancouver — it might never achieve something akin to being New York's SoHo or Tribeca but it's a start.<span></span> As a companion to the wordmark but never locked up together is a minimalist rendition of the neighborhood's most notable architectural building, a “<a href="https://www.lowtideproperties.com/property/565-gnw/" target="_blank">striking red sculptural retail space</a>”, which is a very nice rendition and abstraction of it. It's not implemented into any of the applications provided so I wonder whether it came before, after, or if it just spawned somewhere along the design process. [UPDATE: Confirmed that that the icon was commissioned by the client from another designer after the identity had been created.] Would have been nice to see it adapt to the applications, which, instead, favor more play with perspective angles as a series of patterns serve as backdrops and typography is animated along an imaginary axis that conveys the same dimensionality in the logo. I do like the extension of the perspective technique and spinning behavior to the silhouetted photography, which allows the district to easily use royalty-free or tenant-provided photography to speak in its own visual language. Using <a href="https://goodtypefoundry.com/plakat/" target="_blank">Plakat Grotesk</a> throughout, the result is good if not necessarily exciting or unique but it does extend well into the event graphics without being overly repetitive. Overall, a nice maturation from the old logo supported by an identity that can successfully convey the flavor of the district and that can let people know when they've stepped within its boundaries.</p>

                                            <p>Some very effusive restaurant identities this week, with work from Guadalajara, Malden, and Medellín.</p>

<h1 class="friday_likes">Pink Tiger by Estudio Albino</h1>
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/friday_likes_pinktiger.jpg" alt="Pink Tiger by Estudio Albino" />

<p style="margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;"><a href="https://www.pinktigerdc.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pink Tiger</a> is a restaurant in Washington, DC, offering a blend of Asian fare with American flair in what <a href="https://dc.eater.com/2024/12/13/24320160/wharf-retro-glam-restaurant-pink-tiger-kaliwa-dc-openings" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Eater describes</a> as a “Retro-Glam” setting. The identity, designed by Guadalajara, Mexico-based <a href="https://estudioalbino.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Estudio Albino</a>, is pink and has a tiger which is exactly what the name called for. Beyond those two basic must-haves, the applications and range of assets are evocative of the restaurant&#8217;s “Asian fare with American flair” MO but with a heavy emphasis on the flair as a bevy of tiger drawings and a handful of wordmarks and monograms come together in an exuberant identity punctuated by martini glasses and disco balls and a range of printed applications in a lovely color palette accentuated by gold foil. Each of the elements on its own would have made for a great identity but all of them together? Absolutely tasty (and tasteful) all around. <span class="pagination_divider"></span><span class="small_caps"><a href="https://www.behance.net/gallery/207340053/PINK-TIGER" target="_blank" rel="noopener">See full project</a></span></p>

<h1 class="friday_likes">Mr. H by Proportion</h1>
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/friday_likes_mrh.jpg" alt="Mr. H by Proportion" />

<p style="margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;"><a href="https://www.mrhchinese.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mr. H</a>, in Boston, MA, is a “modern Chinese restaurant that weaves a sophisticated reverence for the cuisines of mainland China &amp; Taiwan with the vibrant, intimate energy of a Shanghainese cocktail lounge.” The identity, designed by Malden, MA-based <a href="https://www.proportiondesign.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Proportion</a>, takes a cue from the opulent and dense interiors designed by <a href="https://www.rockwellgroup.com/projects" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rockwell Group</a>, to deliver a rich and layered visual complement to the space. While the logo, oddly, gives some <a href="https://www.benihana.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Benihana</a> that&#8217;s where the similarities end with the mainstream chain or any other Chinese restaurant as Proportion keeps layering and layering bits and pieces on every possible surface, from menus to coasters. The menu in particular is delectable but even the more pared-down applications where just a single spot illustration does all the heavy lifting are quite nice too. Still can&#8217;t get over the interiors though… so over the top in the best of ways. <span class="pagination_divider"></span><span class="small_caps"><a href="https://www.proportiondesign.com/project/mr-h-chinese-cuisine" target="_blank" rel="noopener">See full project</a></span>

<h1 class="friday_likes">Hasta La Pizza Baby by Invade Design</h1>
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/friday_likes_hastalapizzababy.jpg" alt="Hasta La Pizza Baby by Invade Design" />

<p style="margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:30px!important;"><a href="https://www.instagram.com/hastalapizza.baby/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hasta La Pizza Baby</a> is a pizza joint in Medellín, Colombia, serving Neapolitan-style pizza. The identity, designed by local firm <a href="https://www.invade.design/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Invade Design</a>, introduces a custom typeface “Inspired by Italian shop signs, Depero’s futurism, and the expansion of dough” as the primary design element and it&#8217;s all kinds of fun with its funky construction and variable weights that, at its lightest, yields some comically large counterspaces and at its heaviest, it evokes the bulbous crusts Neapolitan-style pizzas are well-known (and well-loved) for. The choice of navy blue as the main brand color is unexpected for a pizza place but it works great on the kraft pizza boxes to create a contemporary vibe. Not shown above, there is also a supporting character, “Mr. Baby”, a chef with chest on his hair, a Machiavellian mustache, and, NGL, a bit of a creeper look, all of which clashes a little with the rest of the identity. Still, great name, great logo, great typeface, great-looking pizza. <span class="pagination_divider"></span><span class="small_caps"><a href="https://www.behance.net/gallery/217404795/HASTA-LA-PIZZA-BABY" target="_blank" rel="noopener">See full project</a></span></p>

                                            <p><strong>Relevant quote</strong><br /><em>Datalily (formerly CXD Studio) is a rare kind of studio. They have a capable team of data scientists conducting original research to create content for clients that is valuable and insightful. And they also have the creative capabilities in writers, designers and marketers who know how to shape that data great looking content that converts. Our whole goal with this rebrand was to highlight this duality of data and creativity, starting with the logo. The custom wordmark features a monoline script with precise rhythm in the verticals and rounds. For the icon, a bar chart blooms charmingly into a lily. To further drive home the story of creative content rooted in research, we developed a unique illustration style of abstract and vivid data visualizations.

                                            <p><strong>Opinion</strong><br />
                                            The old logo — apologies for the low resolution — was fine, with an icon that doubled as a “C” and a pie chart and a somewhat interesting typeface choice (although with an unnecessary “tu” ligature). With the new name, that I am assuming is a play on the idea of letting data bloom, the new logo introduces a charming flower icon shaped loosely like, naturally, <a href="https://www.google.com/search?sca_esv=33dfbfdc183bdef6&amp;sxsrf=AHTn8zq2YjqZxIh-9LAgPAzo9PQFH5T0PQ:1738235641086&amp;q=lily&amp;udm=2&amp;fbs=ABzOT_CWdhQLP1FcmU5B0fn3xuWpA-dk4wpBWOGsoR7DG5zJBsxayPSIAqObp_AgjkUGqekYoUzDaOcDDjQfK4KpR2OINEbsytxZ36uaO6r0lhkH8HZT3VyUrLGI-LDL7xCNLjzuLOgwGLqI_x05fiwoWlEPAjyX0pevgkORPz3K2ilsVPkFBavYiuoNPsZdQA5bjB7E-U4gkvlbO8XysEGDV8qCOZtaog&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiK1rCvqJ2LAxUmE1kFHa4iDrgQtKgLegQIIBAB&amp;biw=1838&amp;bih=1144&amp;dpr=2" target="_blank">a lily</a> as it emanates from a bar chart, which, admittedly, I had not interpreted on my own until reading the design quote. It's a cool icon that could have easily come from one of those 1960s Eastern European logo collections (which is meant as a compliment).<span></span> The wordmark has quite a bit going on… there is obviously the upright script approach, the tall ascenders, the angled stroke of the “D” with the matching tail of the “y”, and the nubby stems on the “a”s but despite all of that there is a fun simplicity and clarity to it. I could have probably done without the open, angled “D” as it's visually distracting and I'm not sure it serves any conceptual purpose. The icon and wordmark are odd bedfellows that work surprisingly well together.<span></span>  For the identity, a series of data-esque illustrations in a lovely color palette serve as the cornerstones and even though none of them are charting anything in particular they are very convincing at conveying the idea that Datalily can make complex data look accessible <em>and</em> bad-ass. The icon set, which I don't often comment on, is excellent, with an aesthetic that is a perfect blend and meeting point of the aesthetic of the icon and wordmark and they feature, as Hoodzpah calls them, “blurpy” corners, which is the best term I have heard yet to describe what I usually call ink swells. The blurpiness extends to the coolest typeface choice in the identity, <a href="https://www.pfa-typefaces.com/" target="_blank">Haben</a> that, sadly, gets the least play as details in the illustrations and that I demand to see more of. I do understand that the wordmark and Haben would be too competing so the choice of the more restrained <a href="https://weltkern.com/typefaces/lausanne" target="_blank">TWK Lausanne</a> makes sense I guess and a mono, <a href="https://signalfoundry.com/typefaces/ballinger-mono" target="_blank">Ballinger Mono</a> in this case, never not works. Overall, a very satisfying identity that blends rigor and effusiveness, just like any good data visualization should.</p>

Over the past 30 years they&#8217;ve served exclusively commercial and industrial clients — large businesses like Snack Brands Australia and large municipalities like the cities of Sydney and Adeliade. As of 2024 the company began to expand into providing residential electricity plans.

Flow Power has entered the residential energy market with a new offer — one that gives discounts to customers who use energy when prices are lower and renewables plentiful in the grid — and needed a brand to cut through a sea of greenwashing and jargon, to resonate with an audience that has historically been price-driven.

</figure>

<p>This logo has been around in more or less the same form since <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvDGfPJQEqU" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the name change from Progressive Green in 2017</a>. It belongs to the core Flow Power business, and the residential campaign identity we&#8217;re covering today isn&#8217;t putting on a new name or logo. So while it&#8217;s important to note that Self-titled didn&#8217;t make this mark, much of the color and shape language of the identity that they did make takes some major cues from it, meaning we still need to take a critical look to kick things off.</p>

<p>The air gap construction seen here is an old industry standard. Make a break in a line as it goes under another line and you achieve the illusion of dimensionality while keeping everything flat and faxable. If it&#8217;s good enough for Coca-Cola, who am I to complain?</p>

<p>The problem is, when used so much in such a short word &#8211; not just between letters but within the crossbar of the “f” and bend of the “w” &#8211; the flow of the word &#8220;flow&#8221; is completely broken. If you stuck around to the end of the 2017 introduction video linked above, you&#8217;ll have noticed that <a href="https://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/FlowPower2025_Logo2017.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this wasn&#8217;t always the case</a>. The hard stencil-like gaps were originally much softer shadows, a technique which is still in vogue with much newer electric company logos (see: <a href="https://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/new_logo_and_identity_for_edp_by_pentagram.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">EDP by Pentagram, Jun. 8 2022</a>). How and why the logo switched to its current form is unknown and outside the scope of this review, so I&#8217;ll just say the gaps bug me and move on.</p>

<p>The orange is nice. Energetic, but not necessarily electrical. It pairs well with the teal. On to new business.</p>

<blockquote>
FP Emotional is a hand-written typeface created specifically for Flow Power. Crafted by our in-house team, it contains 270 glyphs and more than 40 discretionary ligatures to ensure it ‘flows’. It balances out the assertive, bold characteristics of the primary brand font – RB Rational – with a friendlier, human touch. The two typefaces work together in a double-barreled messaging system that forms the core of the Flow Power residential brand.

<p>With the immovable object of the existing Flow logo as a cornerstone, the typographic approach builds upon it masterfully. Rene Bieder&#8217;s <a href="https://www.renebieder.com/fonts/neue-rational" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Neue Rational Condensed</a> in dark navy is the perfect foil to the bright orange logo script, every bit as solid and angular as the wordmark isn&#8217;t. The new custom type, FB Emotional, not only has a delightfully contrasting name but also manages to thread a very difficult needle in taking construction cues from the logo without diluting its presence. It&#8217;s still a script, but much looser. It&#8217;s still a monowidth line, but much lighter. It&#8217;s still made of continuous lines, but without the wordmark&#8217;s gaps. The composite effect is a custom typeface that looks every bit like it belongs with the logo without stealing the thunder of the logo itself.</p>

<blockquote>
Climate change is surrounded by negativity and guilt, but we know it’s not driving behaviour change. We brought some optimism and fun through illustrated characters that celebrate making a difference. Extending the hand-drawn characteristics of the logo and typeface into illustrations, notations and icons, these are further brought to life through animation.

<p>I&#8217;m very enamored with the illustrations. Making mascots of all the key imagery of batteries and solar panels gives a feel-good friendly vibe which jells well with the positive messaging and overall business positioning of doing good by the environment. The tiny faces are adorable, and their sunny dispositions are made all the more lively with simple but effective motion styling. Much like that wind turbine, I&#8217;m a big fan.</p>

<p>When they&#8217;re all plugged in to the layouts, the type and illustrations play nicely together. Having two different typographic moods to dial into between Rational and Emotional allows for the necessary range to tackle both the more serious pieces like the graphs and price efficiency copy and the more playful social spots.</p>

<p>A new element introduced here is the photo styling. It&#8217;s got a nice slightly muted palette &#8211; it&#8217;d be tempting to lean into neon green grass and sky-blue skies to really put the &#8220;new&#8221; in &#8220;renewable&#8221;, but the vibrancy is kept a little more reserved to allow a healthy contrast for the bold pop of white and orange text over top.</p>

<p>Extra special kudos to the &#8220;Change Power, Power Change&#8221; line that&#8217;s a perfect call-to-action for an ecological electricity business which has seemingly, somehow slipped under the radar of every other renewables company for the entire history of the green energy movement. Flabbergasted that that wasn&#8217;t taken, it&#8217;s so perfect.</p>

<p>The printed applications let themselves get a bit wordier than their digital counterparts. What it loses in snappiness it makes up for by utilizing the orange lines once again for a series of edits, revisions, and mark-ups to create some fun wordplay. It&#8217;s not a new idea, but it&#8217;s effectively reused here.</p>

<p class="end">Taking an existing logo and re-purposing all the elements into a new campaign aimed at a new audience is quite the task. While Self-titled definitely had one of the friendlier industrial energy retailer logos as a starting point, they still managed to take what cues were available in a wholly new and effective direction for the company, giving this 8-year old mark on a 30-year old company a new lease on life. All things considered, it&#8217;s amazing that it flows together as well as it does.</p>
