                                            <p>In July, Tropicana introduced a new plastic bottle with a more “normal” contour for easier pouring and a cap with less plastic. You would think this would please people in this day and age with its more conscientious use of materials but, apparently, the old bottle, with its more dramatic contour and big-ass cap, had a sway with consumers who have been very clear they do not like the new bottle: According to sales data by market research firm Circana, Tropicana sales decreased first by 8.3% in July, followed by a drop to 10.9% in August, and bottoming out at 19% less sales by October in comparison to the year prior. It didn&#8217;t help that the new bottle holds 6 ounces less and that, although Tropicana suggested that retailers drop the price by 70 cents, some have stuck to the old price. Tropicana really just has a knack for angering its clientele.

Sponsored by the Department for Energy and Net Zero, it’s part of the Government’s Major Projects Portfolio — and the UK’s flagship fusion programme. Based at a site in West Burton, STEP was established by the UK Atomic Energy Authority (UKAEA)  — but will ultimately be delivered by the wholly owned subsidiary, UK Industrial Fusion Solutions Ltd (UKIFS). Our vision is clear: a world in which fusion energy powers everyday life — for everyone, everywhere. We’re targeting first operations for 2040. Although STEP is currently 100% Government funded, UKIFS — as a private company limited by shares set up by the Government — will establish and lead a public and private alliance to deliver the programme. This will provide an opportunity for future private investment.&#8221;</p>

The identity captures the programme's mission to establish the UK as a leader in next-generation technology.<br /><br />The visual identity defies typical energy brand conventions, using gradients and a vibrant palette of pink, lilac, and dark blue to symbolise fusion, plasma, and space. The bold, all-caps STEP wordmark pairs with an emblem evoking the tokamak – a machine that generates fusion energy. The emblem, an abstract 'S' with graphic waves and a central star, underscores STEP's ambition and nods to fusion science.<br /><br />A custom font, STEP Sans, designed in collaboration with Pangram Pangram, echoes the tokamak shape, conveying a confident, modern style.<br /><br />Drawing inspiration from space exploration, STEP branding includes 'mission patches' – akin to the badges worn by astronauts – representing the organisation's departments. Each patch uses STEP's distinct colours and descriptors to celebrate the teamwork driving this ambitious project.

                                            <p><strong>Opinion</strong><br />
                                            This is a funky one… on the one hand, there is something very engaging about the logo at first glance, from the extended letters to the space-age icon but, on the other hand, there are some questionable inconsistencies. Mainly, it's the “S” for me that keeps the logo from being more stellar (literally and metaphorically). I understand it's the one letter that doesn't have a vertical stroke but I think it really needed some thickening somewhere, anywhere, to bring it in step — see what I did there? — with the rest of the letters, which, as cool as they are, they maybe feel a little too informal for the subject of fusion energy.<span></span> The icon-slash-“S”-monogram is interesting and it definitely looks like something that could be on the side of a rocket but the way the curves emanate from the star is somewhat uncomfortable. To their credit, the vector work is spot on, it's just the actual shapes of the curves and the resulting negative spaces that are the questionable. Despite the grievances I do like the two elements and the ensuing lock-up.<span></span> The identity extends the wordmark into a full typeface, which has some really cool characters but all the letters lacking that flared contrast feel really out of place and break the texture of the other letters. Like in the logo, the typeface doesn't seem quite well suited for the topic nor does the color palette but, to be honest, I am not sure what the correct answer for a government-yet-private, future-facing, energy-supplying think tank is and I do want to acknowledge the leap of faith taken here to imagine something so unexpected.<span></span> Things then get extra funky with some kinetic energy texture <em>thing</em> that does look pretty bad-ass but then that's counteracted with some cheesy outer glows on the typography. The applications have a vibrant presence thanks to the color palette but the typesetting is literally all over the place, going from tightly tracked to enormously spaced and the blocks of longer text feel unnecessarily busy. Overall, this is literally energetic and in that sense it is quite appropriate but it also needs some harnessing into something more cohesive.</p>

Ayoh is described as “mayo with a POV” and as being “Packed with texture, flavor, bits and bobs” to deliver four flavors: Original Mayo, Dill Pickle Mayo, Tangy Dijonayo, and Hot Giardinayo. Packaged in 12-ounce, squeezable bottles the mayos use cage-free, non-GMO eggs; non-GMO high oleic sunflower oil; and no artificial colors or flavors. Launched among plenty of press hoopla, the packaging has been designed by Brooklyn, NY-based <a href="https://center.design/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CENTER</a>.</p>

<blockquote>We worked with Molly to craft a design system that pays homage to the sandwich shops, delis and diners that gave birth to the quintessentially American go-anywhere food. Inspired by menu-boards and vintage ephemera, it celebrates the legacy of the places and recipes passed down through generations.</blockquote><h3><a href="https://center.design/project/ayoh/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CENTER project page</a></h3>

<blockquote>The goal, he says, was to design a brand “that feels like it’s always been here,” just with a few modern touches. Ayoh’s custom wordmark, made in collaboration with designer Alec Tear, is inspired by old diner signage, but it’s also meant to look like it was literally “written in mayo,” Center says, with just a touch of “gloopiness” to really sell it.</blockquote><h3><a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/91229388/molly-baz-new-brand-ayoh-mayo" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Fast Company</em> article</a></h3>

<p>Before reading the quote above, which I found this morning while writing the intro, my first impression of the logo when I saw it last week was that it looked like it had been written by squeezing the mayo out of the bottle, which I know is not a big leap in imagination but it&#8217;s nice to know that that was part of the intention and inspiration for this deliciously gooey, half-script, half-retro, 100% tasty wordmark. Everything about it is so well balanced and resolved, from the overall upward angle to the ligatures to the tapering of the exclamation point — just perfectly executed. I would have personally moved the “oh” part just a hair closer to the “Ay” part but that may have compromised the kerning, which is spot on. The one odd thing, and I&#8217;m guessing this is a legal matter with the name and that it had to be included in the logo, is the “FOODS” bit… it&#8217;s well integrated and as un-distracting as possible but it does look slightly out of place. The monogram is solid and perhaps, in the future, it could benefit from a gooey holding shape of some sort to give it more heft.</p>

<blockquote>Center’s team even created their own mascot for the brand named “Sando Sam,” who’s inspired by ink prints on old diner menus. “Stylistically, Sam is illustrated with an organic feel, using varying line thickness and textured stroke,” Center says. “Each iteration of Sam adapts with unique accessories and expressions to match the flavor they’re embodying. Sam serves as both a storyteller and brand ambassador, adding personality—all with a playful nod to classic brand mascots like Mr. Peanut, the Vlassic Stork and the Morton Salt Girl.”</blockquote><h3><a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/91229388/molly-baz-new-brand-ayoh-mayo" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Fast Company</em> article</a></h3>

<p>The mascot, “Sando Sam”, is delightful with their funky little arms and fine choice in footwear, from sneakers to cowboy boots to pumps. I also love the gender ambiguity in both name and accessories, looking particularly fetching with the little bows on their slice of bread head.</p>

<p>The type family, <a href="https://abcdinamo.com/typefaces/rom" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ROM</a>, with all of its widths and weights, is a great choice that delivers a one-two punch of Gothic-style sans serif and Grotesk in one vintage-y yet contemporary family. The type-on-a-curve animation is a little painful to watch and a bit out of character for the brand as it feels very forced, whereas the rest feels more authentic. I would love to see more of the subtle texture and lovely drop-shadow animation of the stickers, which doesn&#8217;t repeat anywhere again, sadly. The ingredient illustrations are great, with a slightly cartoon-y look that matches Sando Sam.</p>

<p>The packaging is great, looking like it came straight out of a 1950s deli with its lo-fi design and clunky-on-purpose layout with funky holding shapes and cheesy script typography, all in a simple monochrome 2-color combination for each of the flavors. I can&#8217;t pinpoint exactly why but I really like the intersection treatment of the logo and the starburst with the primary box holding shape where they simply knocked it out. It&#8217;s almost like it&#8217;s the wrong solution but it works so well to give it that imperfect vibe.</p>

<p class="end">Not much in other applications and the two samples above feel like they are missing some of the nuance, texture, and flavor that make the packaging work so well… I mean they show the packaging but, still, the two samples could use some extra tang — something like <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DCkk-TPS6_j/?img_index=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">what they have here</a> starts to feel more in tune with the packaging. Overall, a highly satisfying, sandwich-celebrating, feel-good brand to make mayo more exciting and enticing, cementing its role as the cornerstone of a good sandwich. Sincerely, a mayo lover.</p>

                                            <p><strong>Relevant quote</strong><br /><em>With the formula in place the team turned to Earthling Studio to disrupt the already crowded sleep supplement space with an identity that married the credibility and scientific rigour of the formula with an elevated lifestyle aesthetic that would fit seamlessly into consumers nightly wind down routines. Health is after all, the new wealth. The team collectively defined Cuddle’s mission to prioritize sleep health for all by placing science at the centre, ensuring everyone experiences the benefits of remarkable sleep. <br /><br />Four unique rhythmic patterns were created and animated in collaboration with Damon Xart, to dramatize the remarkable activity and hypnotic natural rhythms that pulse through our bodies and minds when we sleep. The four patterns leverage the brands distinctive use of colour and link to the key benefits of the product which helps you to relax, restore, replenish and rebalance, night after night.<br /><br />[From] the get-go we knew a confident use of colour was going to be key to establishing Cuddle as a new benchmark in the emerging sleep supplement category and we were conscious not to follow some of the clichés that have become associated with this new sector. As a result, we landed on a serene yet bold blue. This is used consistently throughout the brand to deliver an ownable balance of calm and authority. We also developed a secondary palate of blue hues that can be dialled up and down depending on the context. A vivid blue to aid performance, a cool blue to deliver more scientific content and deep blue to provide some overall contrast.<br /><br />The product formula itself brings together 11 science-backed natural ingredients which have been added to the identity as reimagined botanical illustrations, delivering a consistent aesthetic for each remarkable active component. Lastly, an elegant custom wordmark, inspired by sleep cycles, was crafted with typographer Rob Clarke and a family of accompanying fonts were selected, to deliver a delicate mix of lifestyle and science.

                                            With a name like Cuddle and the topic being sleep, you would expect (or maybe desire) to see a more literal cuddly logo but since this isn't about mattresses or high-thread-count duvet covers but about the science of sleep, taking a sharper approach makes sense and positions the product as a high-end supplement to enhance your sleep, not lull you to a slumber. Drawn by Rob Clarke, the logo is slick and really well balanced considering the gigantic counter- and negative spaces in the letters and their extra large x-height… this could have gone wrong easily. I keep debating in my head whether the top of the stems in the “d”s and the “l” should also have a flare but I'm sure they tried it and wasn't as good.<span></span> The identity introduces some pretty cool elements, starting with the curvy, flow-y gradients with light traveling along their contours — put that on an IMAX screen and you can hypnotize a whole army. The botanical diagrams of the ingredients are stunning in their blue monotones that, when placed on the dark blue background, almost look like x-rays or like inverse <a href="https://www.google.com/search?sca_esv=f3453ca69a4fb869&amp;sxsrf=ADLYWIJ6903XGqzo882IIzOCKUy4N-qfrQ:1732628879123&amp;q=sunprint&amp;udm=2&amp;fbs=AEQNm0Aa4sjWe7Rqy32pFwRj0UkWd8nbOJfsBGGB5IQQO6L3J03RPjGV0MznOJ6Likin94pT_oR1DTSof42bOBxoTNxGs5h3lx9XX8FU_U5TWi-rTmktahp2w8gbe4IVV2JAg-Fk6-OjNujvWq2IwrQnBNjpYt92weGteEsyZmOT9iLTFpvhZsK1A0TYSL-NY1XHqKo22hF9WBQwpuc2ovZegzFg4LNrmw&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiCpPjGkfqJAxWM8MkDHTbzGHUQtKgLegQIHRAB&amp;biw=1408&amp;bih=1225&amp;dpr=2" target="_blank">SunPrints</a> while the supporting diagrams look scientific AF. Although it didn't need that much extra, the choice of <a href="https://www.myfonts.com/collections/tt-ramillas-font-typetype/?refby=ucllc" target="_blank">TT Ramillas</a> adds some gravitas with its editorial quality and helps make the abundance of That Blue look more sophisticated and less electric.<span></span> The packaging is quite straightforward, letting the blue and the wordmark do all the heavy lifting, which they do, valiantly. Overall, in a market drenched in sleep supplement solutions, Cuddle stands out for its sharpness and its ability to look scientific without it looking or sounding — the copywriting is excellent, by the way — like you are just taking high-end NyQuil full of chemicals as many other science-backed sleep pills are.</p>

                                            <p>Established in 2016, <a href="https://thecoconutcult.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Coconut Cult</a> is a brand of <em>super-live</em> coconut yogurt and coconut gelato that contain billions of active human-strain probiotics in every serving thanks to a blend of 16 strains of probiotics packaged in glass jars to avoid pasteurization after fermentation and allow the bacteria to thrive. Founded by Noah Simon-Waddell who began experimenting with home-made yogurt and probiotics for his own health concerns, The Coconut Cult has literally grown a cult following thanks to its taste, texture, and authentic personality (that, engagingly, leans weird) — it also helps that it&#8217;s available in every Whole Foods in the country. While the product looks like you could eat the full jar in one sitting, the recommended dose is only two tablespoons which provides a whopping <a href="https://ancientnutrition.com/blogs/all/what-are-cfus" target="_blank" rel="noopener">50 billion CFU</a> so unless you want to spend the rest of eternity pooping, heed the serving size. Recently, The Coconut Cult began rolling out a new identity and packaging designed by Brooklyn, NY-based <a href="https://andwalsh.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&amp;Walsh</a>.</p>

<blockquote>Prior to the rebrand Coconut Cult used a changing wordmark and graphic system, while very playful and true to their creative nature, made brand consistency a challenge. As they were expanding their product line, they came to us to solve on this issue. Our goal with the rebrand was to preserve their playful essence within a more unified brand system.<br /><br />The packaging system was designed to enhance shelf visibility while maintaining the fun that only Coconut Cult can pull off in the dairy-free yogurt aisle. We crafted labels for Coconut Cult&#8217;s 16oz, 8oz, and single-serve product. The wordmark and frame system were designed as consistent anchors across Coconut Cult’s different sizes and flavors. We also created a coconut-inspired wordmark to be prominently featured on all packaging.</blockquote><h3><a href="https://andwalsh.com/work/all/coconut-cult/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&amp;Walsh project page</a></h3>

<p>While on the old packaging (below) different wordmarks and type treatments often served loosely as the logo for the brand, one treatment began to overtake the others as the primary logo. With a condensed, flared sans serif approach and a generous drop shadow, it was a wordmark with enough presence and was much better than the predecessor of a flamingo holding a coconut, which had its charm with its Charley Harper-esque aesthetic but was not the best suited for small-use reproduction. Despite the improvement at the time, it wasn&#8217;t the most pleasant of typographic constructions due in part to the amateur lack of overshoot on the rounded letters which made “COCO” look disproportionately small in contrast to “NUT” and even within “NUT” the “N” looked enormous. The drop shadow resulted in negative spaces that were all kinds of wonky. The new logo fixes pretty much everything that was wrong with the old one with proper overshoots, a better balance of widths, and a drop shadow that unifies the letters. It could have probably gone one or two more rounds in perfecting it but it&#8217;s definitely an improvement.</p>

<p>The old packaging was very much all over the place but, to its credit, it established a playfulness and looseness that is still present in the new, more controlled system. The premise to the new packaging is simple: Logo, quirky illustration, funky frame, groovy supporting type. Repeat. What makes this work and feel so rich and diverse is that the illustrations are great and take advantage of the wild flavor combinations and their names to create some fun compositions. The frames are ornate and detailed while being very nicely integrated with the illustrations and, when it comes to groovy type choices, it&#8217;s hard to go wrong with <a href="https://verycoolstudio.com/typefaces/gooper" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gooper</a>.</p>

</figure>

<p>As we move from packaging into other applications we head straight into &amp;Walsh&#8217;s happy place of off-beat illustrations, hyper-colored color palettes, and weird photographic compositions primed for social media engagement and allure. The illustrations are great in both style — Corporate Memphis gone un-corporate — and content… flamingos flanking a toilet, coconuts with a third eye, intestines that blink. It could all be too much but there is a relative restraint that makes it all work quite nicely.</p>
