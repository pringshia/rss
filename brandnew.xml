                                            <p>(Est. 1854) &#8220;The <a href="https://drentsmuseum.nl/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Drents Museum</a> is known in the Netherlands and abroad for its major international exhibitions in the fields of archaeology, art and history and for its daring, special activities and leading exhibitions. With this we attract around 200.000 visitors to the museum every year. The Drents Museum has a beautiful and spacious exhibition wing of 1000 square meters that meets all modern safety, security and climate requirements. We have a diverse collection divided into five main collections: Archaeology, Drenthe History, Painters of Drenthe, Art around 1900 and Contemporary Realism. The collection of the Drents Museum contains almost 100.000 objects. We have been collecting since the founding of the museum in 1854. The Drents Museum is one of the oldest museums in the Netherlands.&#8221;</p>

                                            <p><strong>Relevant quote</strong><br /><em>The renewed visual identity underlines the new direction and programming of the Drents Museum. The museum will become even more accessible to young and old alike with the addition of the collection presentation Labyrinthia. In addition, the museum continues to work on its ambition to be internationally meaningful. This ambition and daring is also reflected in the programming and upcoming campaigns.<br /><br />The new identity fulfills the need to be able to vary in color, layout, image and movement. Without the brand losing its recognizability. The new logo consists of three variants, which can be used according to context and purpose. For example, the public will increasingly encounter the name Drents instead of the full brand name. In this variant, we focus on the unique and distinctive aspect of the name.<br /><br />The new visual identity has been rolled out in phases since last summer. Part of the rollout also includes involving and marketing the new location Drents Museum De Buitenplaats in Eelde. Art Nouveau art is central at this location.

                                            <p><strong>Opinion</strong><br />
                                            It's too bad that the “Drents” typography in the old logo was so default because the part spelling “MUSEUM” with only four letters was amazingly clever and I'm surprised that no one — I think — has done it before. It did require from the viewer putting in some effort into reading it going from left to right then diagonally down then across then back up and across one last time but it works. Or, well, it worked. The new logo maintains the blockiness of the old one with “E”s and “M”s sharing the same glyph, drawn in a square container with all the strokes going edge to edge. The rest of the letters are normal, leaving the final composition caught somewhere in between being weird and being normal, which makes it hard to decode what kind of museum this is: traditional or avant gard? Old or new? Archeology or contemporary art?<span></span> An argument could be made both ways that this is either confusing in that it doesn't send a clear message of what to expect from the museum or liberating in that the museum can flex in whichever way it serves its mission best without being confined. The logo benefits from the very pleasant mix of six letters in each word, so it can stack very neatly and pleasantly but that arrangement then also emphasizes the conflict in the letter shapes and when “DRENTS” is used on its own (as is often the case based on the applications) the “E” stands out like a sore thumb appearing so much wider than the rest of the letters. Nonetheless, in its various configurations, it does serve as a solid logo to anchor the various layouts, which could use from some consistency and/or some form of visual device to tie them better together or give them some more visual interest beyond the slightly generic use of <a href="https://www.swisstypefaces.com/fonts/suisse/#Int%E2%80%99l" target="_blank">Suisse Int’l</a>. Overall, some personal hesitations aside and even if it's a little on the shy and conservative side, this does fit within the visual realm of Dutch museums and that's already a solid starting point.</p>

<h1 class="friday_likes">Room for Milly by Perky Bros</h1>
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/friday_likes_roomformilly.jpg" alt="Room for Milly by Perky Bros" />

<p style="margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;"><a href="https://www.roomformilly.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Room for Milly</a> is a cocktail bar in Denver, CO, that is “inspired by travels and explorations of foreign lands and curiosities”. The titular “Milly” is a fictional character named Milly Parker, a socialite, world traveler, and magnetic personality, upon which Nashville, TN-based <a href="https://perkybros.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Perky Bros</a> built an identity around. As an example, the lovely and intricate icon is a “pair of dancing Brazilian ruby hummingbirds” that represent “the talisman she carried, which was given to her by Mururi during her travels along the border between Peru and Brazil.” (You can take a peek at the non-gold-foil version <a href="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/8314bd_f941beb8aefe4e419588122c09ece6ba~mv2.png/v1/fill/w_500,h_500,al_c,q_100,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,enc_avif,quality_auto/RFM_Symbol_RGB_Gold.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.) Carrying on the playful yet elegant quirkiness is the wordmark, typeset in <a href="https://www.charlotterohde.de/typefaces/calyces-inc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Calyces</a> by Charlotte Rohde, which looks particularly nice in all of that generous gold foil, whether it&#8217;s on the thick leather menu or the cotton-y coasters. A series of spot illustrations that look as if they were drawn with watercolor on a travel journal complete the identity, which is all kinds of delightful. Just like Milly. <span class="pagination_divider"></span><span class="small_caps"><a href="https://perkybros.com/work/brand-identity/room-for-milly-cocktails-and-color/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">See full project</a></span></p>

<h1 class="friday_likes">Garden Pizza by Requena Office</h1>
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/friday_likes_gardenpizza.jpg" alt="Garden Pizza by Requena Office" />

<p style="margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;"><a href="https://www.instagram.com/gardenpizza_/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Garden Pizza</a> is a small pizza chain in Spain dishing Neapolitan-style pies from five locations across Barcelona, all of which honor its name with <a href="https://gardenpizza.cat/restaurantes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">locales</a> filled to the brim with plants. The identity, designed by local firm <a href="https://www.andresrequena.es/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Requena Office</a>, is built around an unconventional custom typeface aptly called Avant Garden, which is based on, yes, Avant Garde but where the stem of any round letter is offset and curved to (perhaps a little too subtly) evoke the sense of a plant&#8217;s stem sticking out in different ways. I am guessing this will not be to everyone&#8217;s liking or satisfaction and, to be honest, I&#8217;m not sure I&#8217;m completely on board with it but I can definitely appreciate the willingness to do something so out of the ordinary — and the font name alone is worth applauding. In application, a series of abstract plant-shaped graphic starbursts in bright colors serve as backdrops and accents for the typography while the primary green color further builds on the garden theme. It&#8217;s worth noting that each of the starburst has eight “sections” just like the typical eight cuts made on a pizza and I would gladly settle for one or two (or sixteen) slices of these right about now. <span class="pagination_divider"></span><span class="small_caps"><a href="https://www.andresrequena.es/projects/gardenpizza" target="_blank" rel="noopener">See full project</a></span>

<h1 class="friday_likes">APT.20 by Prost Work</h1>
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/friday_likes_apt20.jpg" alt="APT.20 by Prost Work" />

<p style="margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:30px!important;"><a href="https://www.instagram.com/apt20.coffee/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">APT.20</a> is a small but mighty coffee shop in Marseille, France, that also serves food, hosts DJ sets, tattoo pop-ups, and running club meet-ups. The shop is named after <a href="https://www.instagram.com/zee5/p/CPUxGtLhq3z/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Monica Geller&#8217;s — yes, from <em>FRIENDS</em> — apartment number</a> and was started by married couple, Noemie and Enzo, who are literally embodied in the identity by local firm <a href="https://prost.work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Prost Work</a> in the form of two cheeky bears that adorn everything from the economical stickers on the cups to some charming tufted wall decorations. Being a relatively ridiculous (in a fun, ironic way) solution for a coffee shop, the identity doubles down on the premise with an equally corny wordmark using “<a href="https://creativemarket.com/beckymsimps/6387239-Bounce-House-%E2%80%A2-Bubble-Letter-font" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a bouncy bubble letter font</a>” customized with a heart in the counter of the zero. For an edgy balance, the sans serif <a href="https://type-department.com/products/alfredino-semimono" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alfredino Semimono</a> is added to the mix, helping offset the cute overload of the bears and bouncy bubble letters. The merch also goes from cute to trippy <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C9AStBiMLwV/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">as the mascots blend and melt unto themselves</a> for an overall kind of dark Disney vibe that I may not be completely here for but happy to entertain. <span class="pagination_divider"></span><span class="small_caps"><a href="https://prost.work/work/apt-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">See full project</a></span></p>

                                            <p>Earlier this week, Meghan Markle announced the new name of her lifestyle venture — previously known as American Riviera Orchard that was refused of its trademark application by the US Patent and Trademark Office’s — to <a href="https://asever.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">As Ever</a> with a new logo designed by <a href="https://www.instagram.com/madebyarticle" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Article</a> featuring a palm tree (because California) and two hummingbirds. Shortly thereafter, the Mayor of Porreres, a municipality in the Balearic Islands in Spain, with a population of approximately 5,300, declared with the utmost conviction that Meghan Markle copied their crest, which also features a palm tree and two swallows. No legal action has been taken yet and I doubt any will. Also I don&#8217;t think anyone, not even a fraction of the 5,300 residents of Porreres, knew what the Porreres crest looked like before this to make it a valid case of confusion and “brand” damage to the municipality.

                                            <p><strong>Relevant quote</strong><br /><em>In the central London neighbourhood of Bankside, where Tate Modern and Shakespeare’s Globe sit cheek by jowl, a new destination emerges. Our brief was to give it a new name and brand to take it from unknown development to beloved public destination. Revolving around a central public circle, we gave this destination a confident new name: The Round. It not only spoke to the specialness of the architecture, but also the positive power of gathering together.<br /><br />The symbol is a powerful distillation of the story. It conveys a strong sense of togetherness and speaks directly to the name, creating a recognisable asset in its own right. Like a zoetrope, the animated symbol builds momentum and gathers pace, bringing a sense of dynamism to the identity.<br /><br />We devised an energetic typographic system to deliver our new messaging with rhythm and punch. Taking our cues from architecture, lines of type are purposefully offset and staggered to match the unconventional angles of the buildings. We expand our distinctive symbol into a rich visual world. Large-scale patterns, curved panels to frame photography and interiors that embrace softer edges. Graphic elements are constantly in an orbital motion, echoing the active nature of The Round's central public circle.

                                            <p><strong>Opinion</strong><br />
                                            Time will tell how popular a destination this is but it does have a good foundation in the name for it to already have its own shorthand for people saying “Meet you at The Round” or “Go past The Round and make a right”. It's short, memorable, and fairly distinctive when it comes to developments and relevant to its (future) signature central public circle. The logo introduces a rather nice icon with a lot of implied dimensionality that is very well achieved by the simple modulation of line thicknesses and heights. It's low-key bad-ass in how effective it is at conveying the zoetrope-like construction, all in a single color and without a gradient in sight and even without any motion applied, the icon looks to be in movement. This is not an easy feat. The wordmark is simple and gives off a subtle sense of luxury but not pretentious, thanks in part to the playful leg of the “R”.<span></span> Not much in application or even anything overly ambitious in the visual language. The most distinctive element, which at times is hard to even notice is the curvature applied to the photography as it spins around the layouts. The headline typography takes one lateral step away from the one used in the wordmark by choosing <a href="https://www.schick-toikka.com/dia" target="_blank">Dia</a>, which seems like an unnecessary deviation from what was established by the logo. It's not a bad typeface, it just falls in that same-but-not-same void. It has an engaging treatment in motion, with the messaging being repeated and coming together, like a crowd gathering. On the website but not anywhere else it seems, a secondary serif, <a href="https://margotleveque.com/collections/romie" target="_blank">Romie</a>, is introduced, which feels a little too detailed and contrast-y to be used at smaller sizes and doesn't quite pair well with Dia. Overall, this is a well executed identity in terms of establishing the upscale vibe of the development but it feels like one (or two or three) too many ideas spun together.</p>

Founded by a 21-year-old with psoriatic arthritis, <a href="https://tiltbeauty.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tilt Beauty</a> creates clean makeup that is easy to open, hold, and apply, and safe for ultra-sensitive skin. The first beauty company to earn the Arthritis Foundation Ease of Use® certification, the entire brand — from product ergonomics to packaging design to brand typography — is built around making everyday makeup essentials more accessible. Accompanying their February 4 launch, Tilt has introduced a new logo, identity, product design, and packaging designed by New York, NY-based studio <a href="https://establishednyc.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Established</a>.

<blockquote>
Founder Aerin Glazer asked us to create a new brand of beautiful makeup, specifically designed to be accessible to those with various physical challenges, from chronic pain to low vision, but still be coveted by all. Very few brands have tackled this space, and those that have, often sacrifice the aesthetic in the pursuit of practical solutions. In creating Tilt, we wanted to make products that were both “seriously comfy” and beautiful to look at.

<p>
The logo has a nice organicness to it, giving what are usually three of the least exciting letters of the alphabet a healthy dose of playful dynamism and visual intrigue, all without sacrificing legibility. I appreciate how the wordmark plays off the bulbous forms of the product itself and feels almost like it could have been written with some sort of semi-viscous goo of a potentially makeup-y nature, making it feel doubly at home in its environment.
</p>


<blockquote>
The logo was designed to be wobbly, imperfect and still beautiful, perfectly reflecting the ethos of the brand. The secondary packaging is easy to open with large tab tear-off strips, and features Braille product descriptions developed in consultation with The Braille Institute of America. We also used the Braille Institute’s Atkinson Hyper-Legible font throughout the brand, making reading easier for those with low vision.

<p>
The lifestyle photography (by <a href="https://www.instagram.com/stevie_dance/?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Stevie Dance</a>) is simple and straightforward and certainly nothing groundbreaking, but it manages to strike a warm, playful, and welcoming tone all while employing exactly zero frills. I do wonder if they could have done more with photography and video to help convey the accessible nature of their product — using a differently-abled model is a great start, but I’d argue that including one or two older models, who would represent a demographic prone to the challenges of arthritis and low vision, would help flesh out the brand story.

<blockquote>
The products are silicone-coated, for softness and grip-ability, and the curvy shapes are specifically designed to provide a perfectly-placed indent for the finger tips, for those with low grip strength. The mascara wand is shorter than standard as we discovered that the length of a standard mascara wand accentuated instability in people with shaky hands. Each product is refillable, and each refill is equipped with a patented flower-shaped stem that easily pushes through the base.

<p>
This project is unique for Brand New in that the product is such an integral part of the brand that this is going to veer slightly into a product design review… so let’s talk about the product. I will venture a guess that I am not the only gutter-minded heathen whose first thought upon beholding this soft, organic, bulbous, silicone item was that it looks like it could potentially serve a more exciting purpose beyond housing makeup (particularly if equipped with a small motor). But once you’re able to get your head out of the gutter, the attention to detail and simplicity of the design is really nice, and debossing, rather than printing, the wordmark both elevates the product and allows the unique logo to take center stage.</p>

<p>While I like the colors subjectively, I am a little curious about the rationale behind the choice to launch with two colors that have such different energy and tone&#8211; given that they&#8217;re only offering two products, it seems like you&#8217;d want them to feel more evenly weighted, and bright yellow vs subdued navy blue does&#8217;t really strike that balance. It will be interesting to see what new colors are introduced, and how, as the product line expands. 
</p>

<p>
The packaging takes a less minimalist approach to design than the product does, but still with very compelling attention to every detail. The <a href="https://www.brailleinstitute.org/freefont/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Braille Institute’s Atkinson Hyperlegible</a> — a font family designed specifically to be easily read by people with low vision— is used exclusively both on the packaging and the website, really doubling down on the brand’s commitment to accessibility. The addition of braille on the package and a specially designed, easy-open pull tab further prove to the audience that Tilt is more than just talk when it comes to design for “every body.”

At the end of the day, it’s hard to argue that Tilt’s branding, on its surface, is anything particularly groundbreaking. But even with just a small handful of applications to judge by, it’s clear that just about every single design decision was carefully considered to ensure the brand stayed consistent and true to its core values, stripping away anything superfluous while still managing to maintain a unique and playful sense of character that could never be truly owned by any other brand. As we enter an era where an entire brand system can be spat out by AI in a matter of minutes, this level of thoughtfulness and proven authenticity is more important than ever.
