                                            <p>In July, Landor had posted a case study on their redesign of <a href="https://www.tupperware.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tupperware</a>. I remember looking at their website and flagging it for publishing the next day. When I came back to their site later that evening, <a href="https://landor.com/en/our-work/tupperware/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the page was (and still is) a 404</a>. I thought they may have launched a little preemptively and had to retract the case study for a few hours or day but it never came back. I wanted to cover it but something seemed off and I decided to wait. Yesterday, as I was doing my Google rounds I found that Tupperware has just filed for bankruptcy and if I read between the lines correctly at the link, the redesign was part of an effort to position the company to be sold but apparently that didn&#8217;t work out and is perhaps a reason why the case study got pulled. Anyway… at the link, Andrew Tindall has an interesting take on how, why, and when Tupperware failed.

                                            <p><strong>Relevant quote</strong><br /><em>As newcomers in the market, Syenex required a comprehensive visual and verbal identity that exuded tech, innovation, and credibility to attract recruits and establish themselves as a dependable partner to their clients. With this in mind, and the open platform Syenex provides for their users, we created an overall identity concept resembling a modular-based, open framework to communicate boundless possibilities and a stable foundation.<br /><br />A universal grid served as one of the main visual elements as well as a foundation for pattern creation. The interconnected fields symbolised cellular interactions and granted limitless potential for pattern formation giving the brand extensive flexibility when creating different assets.<br /><br />The typeface, with round corners and connections, contributed to the bio-inspired appearance, again picking up on cellular interactions. A palette of black, white, and various shades of grey establishes a neutral, minimalist tone with pronounced contrast. Finally, an abstract 3D interpretation of DNA structure was employed as a distinct brand asset, producing a futuristic, and sophisticated aesthetic.

                                            <p><strong>Opinion</strong><br />
                                            Needless to say, I have NO IDEA what Syenex does and every bit of copy about it went straight over my head but it's all definitely about advanced science stuff. Needless to say as well, the old logo was pretty bad with an overly complicated icon with too many elements, an unnecessary gradient, and varying strokes without rhyme or reason paired with a wordmark in yet another stroke width with notches inconsistently placed and sized. The new logo is a huge improvement, introducing a great, abstract “S” monogram constructed from a minimal amount of elements. I really like how unique the “S” shape is and the pinched circles make me think of <a href="https://www.google.com/search?sca_esv=6d3024b606a56b6b&amp;sca_upv=1&amp;sxsrf=ADLYWIJ3MlTTN1XlAQ1hgfQd4g6Esm0QMQ:1726828320870&amp;q=molecule+microscope&amp;udm=2&amp;fbs=AEQNm0DfIOrc-JVK7JSIXTRypzh1d0Xgc-Qx-MWluXtsBh8oLqezDGS-GBRoVhGkujFN9L89G8OpQ_4dZf-PrNf_f2qsBtQmtLqsm6yxAHTedliasJBB9FQSsYwZnyPqqc5ldCsnkGqLbFClqXddPoG99GG8FOnDSp-qlZzIkKjMKkP9CcmcXuDZxiWgaR1I6cT030OuyH9GGaehPhQtpHoYO4976gklqg&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjb8ZzlqNGIAxUi38kDHdq0BI8QtKgLegQIGRAB&amp;biw=1429&amp;bih=1024&amp;dpr=2.2" target=")blank">molecules seen under a microscope</a>. The wordmark is fine and I understand that there was most likely a desire to not distract from the monogram but, add to it the lowercase approach, and maybe it went a little too far in making it <em>not</em> stand out.<span></span> The squares in the monogram are echoed in the headline typeface choice, <a href="https://neuepixelgrotesk.com/" target="_blank">NeuePixel</a>, which takes me back hard to the rave flyer days of the late 1990s and the rise of pixelated typography so it's a little odd to see it used seriously in this scientific context. I low-key like it and I appreciate how the aesthetic of the typeface is extended into the holding shapes with the rounded corners and gooey connections. If I had to give this style a name it would be Pixelated Bacteria. There is also a groovy 3D hero graphic of an abstract and artsy DNA strand that I'm guessing was part of another design option presented but it was liked and ended up here as there is no clear connection between it and the rest of the visual language. I don't mind it, to be honest. The few applications shown are well executed and balanced although I'm still thrown off a little by the pixel font. Overall, the identity maybe has one or two too many design elements and styles going on at once but it definitely oozes “science” and high-tech.</p>

<h1 class="friday_likes">The Penny Bun by GIRL</h1>
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/friday_likes_thepennybun.jpg" alt="The Penny Bun by Girl" />

<p style="margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;">Named after a type of mushroom that can be found in the nearby woods, <a href="https://pennybunilkley.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Penny Bun</a> is an old English pub in rural Yorkshire that doubles as an inn with five, beautifully-appointed rooms. The identity, designed by Leeds, UK-based <a href="https://www.girl.studio/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GIRL</a>, takes its cues from the rustic appeal of the inn with an elegant yet warm design led by the lovely hand-drawn logo that came from “a note one of the owners had written during the early planning stages”. I appreciate that it wasn&#8217;t just scanned in and beefed up but redrawn by hand and very nicely digitized to achieve a very authentic-looking human touch. A series of alternate logo badges — all of which would have been standouts on their own — appear throughout the applications, which are reproduced in a range of earthy papers and materials that effortlessly connect with the interiors and exteriors while various depictions of mushrooms (illustrated and photographed) add some texture. I could sure use a night (or ten) here right about now. <span class="pagination_divider"></span><span class="small_caps"><a href="https://www.girl.studio/work/the-penny-bun" target="_blank" rel="noopener">See full project</a></span></p>

<p style="margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;"><a href="https://ruffocoffee.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ruffo Coffee</a> is a roaster, coffee shop, bakery, restaurant, and online retailer of coffee-making equipment in Santa Fe, Argentina, and, <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Ruffo+Coffee+Co./@-32.9346476,-60.6564199,3a,75y,90t/data=!3m8!1e2!3m6!1sAF1QipMz-i9Uk0aOnphOroHBlYPxfQ_BB1rY104ALOu3!2e10!3e12!6shttps:%2F%2Flh5.googleusercontent.com%2Fp%2FAF1QipMz-i9Uk0aOnphOroHBlYPxfQ_BB1rY104ALOu3%3Dw203-h152-k-no!7i5712!8i4284!4m7!3m6!1s0x95b7ab2d1758075d:0x31b79bec92287d3d!8m2!3d-32.9347825!4d-60.6564536!10e5!16s%2Fg%2F11rq3hmy69?entry=ttu&#038;g_ep=EgoyMDI0MDkxNi4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D" target="_blank" rel="noopener">judging from this photo</a>, a darn popular spot. The identity, designed by Rosario, Argentina-based <a href="https://www.behance.net/estudioaltillo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Estudio Altillo</a>, features a cornucopia of hand-drawn logos, illustrations, and typographic badges as well as some clunky-on-purpose typefaces that come together in a simple black, orange, and white color palette across the rustic-slash-industrial interiors of the location.  In principle none of the elements are particularly well related to each other — some illustrations have eyes and some don&#8217;t; some illustrations have one stroke thickness and some another; and the hand-drawn lettering goes in way too many styles — but everything shares the same chill attitude and as a group certainly help create a welcoming, cozy mood. <span class="pagination_divider"></span><span class="small_caps"><a href="https://www.behance.net/gallery/173257257/Ruffo-Coffee" target="_blank" rel="noopener">See full project</a></span>

<h1 class="friday_likes">Lalo Lalita by VVORKROOM</h1>
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/friday_likes_lalita.jpg" alt="Lalo Lalita by VVORKROOM" />

<p style="margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:30px!important;"><a href="https://www.instagram.com/lalolalitamx/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lalo Lalita</a> is a small restaurant in Mexico City&#8217;s trendy Zone Rosa specializing in chicken wings. (“Lalita” is a contraction of “La Alita” which translates to “The Little Wing” and Lalo is the name of a dude.) The identity, designed by local firm <a href="https://www.behance.net/vvorkroom" target="_blank" rel="noopener">VVORKROOM</a>, features a wordmark in the same popular style <a href="https://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/new_logo_and_packaging_for_bezi_by_red_antler.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">we had yesterday with Bezi</a> of the odd-shaped letterforms with awkwardly-contrasting counterspaces — even down to the lowercase “i”. Not saying this is a copy by any means as both projects were surely done without the knowledge or existence of the other so it&#8217;s just funny how some similar ideas play out at the same time. I wish the “A”s were a little wider in the logo as I think it&#8217;s a pretty fun and funky design but they definitely feel a little disproportionate, especially when there is three of them in the name. A secondary element is a punk-infused, Keith Haring-inspired chicken illustration that has nothing to do with the wordmark and that perhaps could have been less Adobe-Illustrator-y but it certainly has attitude to spare. There is also a rather generic sans serif thrown into the mix and, at times, the identity looks like three different identities, which is one too many “if”s and “but”s… <em>but</em> for some reason, I dig it. <span class="pagination_divider"></span><span class="small_caps"><a href="https://www.behance.net/gallery/174112165/Lalo-Lalita" target="_blank" rel="noopener">See full project</a></span></p>

At the center of this newfound interest is the great nephew of John Two Guns White Calf, the late Blackfeet Nation chief that was depicted in the logo. This coincides with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfNcj83KL5U" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a new memorial</a> inside the team&#8217;s Northwest Stadium that celebrates Walter &#8220;Blackie&#8221; Wetzel — a former Blackfeet Nation tribal chairman and former president of the National Congress of the American Indian — who drew the logo in the early 1970s. It&#8217;s an unlikely Hail Mary.

                                            <p><strong>Relevant quote</strong><br /><em>Civic came to SYLVAIN to help build their brand foundation. And together, they've refined the organization’s mission, values, and identity system—all to reflect their commitment to providing unbiased and community-focused coverage on the most important issues facing Americans today.<br /><br />Inspired by Civic's local reporting, SYLVAIN leaned into the connectedness of neighborhoods and communities, which manifests in the wordmark and symbol: the tight stacking of the letterforms give the impression of clear pathways created between them.<br /><br />Civic's mission and optimism comes to life in the color palette: bright, tonal greens with supporting blues. The colors convey energy and forward-movement, avoiding the political connotations that saturated reds and blues can bring.<br /><br />SYLVAIN created a flexible identity system that would be adaptable alongside Civic's growth. At the center of the system is an ownable holding shape based on the geometry of the Civic wordmark. The shape can flex to support any new beats that Civic pursues in the future.<br /><br />The identity also takes inspiration from classic Americana and old-school public broadcasting, striking a balance between the familiar and the modern.

                                            <p><strong>Opinion</strong><br />
                                            With a name and logo that sound and look like a 1970s TV news production company, this has a very specific kind of vibe that will be some people's jam and not so much others’. I dig the no nonsense approach of the full wordmark with its thin geometric sans serif and odd justification that is anchored by the stems of the “I”, “N”, and “M” across the three lines. Simple, sturdy, and confident although, admittedly, not particularly exciting or memorable. The shorthand logo, on the other hand, I find infinitely pleasing, interesting, and memorable but I can already read the comments that say “CMC”, which is 100% valid and the only reason stopping me from totally fawning over this. Adding slabs to the “I”s maybe could have helped but then it would kill the simplicity.<span></span> What I <em>will</em> fawn over is its animation as a framing device, where it expands by adding more “CIVIC”s — I absolutely love that idea, the treatment, and the resulting compositions. The typography, mixing <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Crimson+Pro" target="_blank">Crimson Pro</a> and <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Figtree" target="_blank">Figtree</a> (both free on Google Fonts), is pretty good and has just the right amount of editorial flair without breaking the bank. The color palette, with the blues and greens, is a little odd… it starts to feel like an eco-conscious publication. This would have rocked in straight-up black and white with maybe one bright accent and one muted background.<span></span> Not a whole lot of applications but something like the multi-panel advertising is quite satisfying as the word “CIVIC” ties all of the segments together as it changes colors at the “C”s. The Instagram posts are fine too but maybe they are missing some image treatment to help give the company some visual ownership of the journalistic imagery. Overall, a simple and solid identity for an organization trying to do right by the people and not overselling or overhyping or fear-mongering what is mostly not-great-news when it comes to the topics of education, elections, and public health in America.</p>

                                            <p>Launched in 2024, <a href="https://www.eatbezi.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bezi</a> is a new labneh dip available in the U.S.. For the uninitiated, labneh is a creamy, tangy, Middle Eastern spread usually made with strained plain yogurt but Bezi does it differently (and more authentically): by making it directly from milk, cream, and culture. Bezi is co-founded by Ilay Karateke — an Istanbul-raised, New York-based, ex-McKinsey consultant turned cheesemaker — and Hasan Bahcivan — a Berkeley-trained engineer that comes from one of Turkey&#8217;s largest cheesemaking families, with a legacy spanning over 60 years. The latter is able to contribute a cheese factory in Turkey near the Greece border with a capability to produce 300 tons of labneh to deliver a version with no tang, making it more approachable and versatile than other dips out there. Bezi is available in three flavors: Plain, Everything, and Red Pepper. The logo, packaging, and verbal identity for Bezi has been created by Brooklyn, NY-based <a href="https://www.redantler.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Red Antler</a>.</p>

<p>I should start by saying that I LOVE labneh so I am predisposed to like everything about this simply because the product itself looks like a delicious-er version of an already delicious food. It helps that the design is loads of fun, making my job easier. Taking the currently popular approach of oddly proportionate letterforms with thicks and thins in the wrong places and counters that don&#8217;t necessarily match, the new logo is a chunky, playful, and approachable wordmark in a funky combination of uppercase and lowercase (basically reading as “BEZi”). The one design decision I question is the counters of the “B” being oval as they feel too distracting and would have worked really well as plain circles to counteract the big tittle of the “i”. Nonetheless, it&#8217;s a fun, attention-grabbing logo. (By the way, the name “Bezi” comes from “Bez”, the Turkish word for “cloth” that alludes to the traditional use of cheesecloths in the making of labneh.)</p>

<p>Before getting into the packaging, there is a small sampling of the visual and verbal language that accompanies the brand and that plays out on their website and social media. Visually, it is led by some speech bubbles that aren&#8217;t particularly relevant but are also such a broad concept that can be applied to anything, including selling labneh. There is also a mascot that is a labneh swirl with legs, which is kind of amusing and adds a bit of a psychedelic, Grateful Dead aesthetic. Lastly, there are some flower-y starburst graphics to house product highlights. All of them are unified by a loose and wobbly design approach. For the verbal identity, <a href="https://www.thesubtext.online/all/bezi-verbal-identity" target="_blank" rel="noopener">you can read some thinking behind it from Red Antler over at The Subtext</a>. While all the reasoning and approach is spot on, the resulting tone of voice is all over the place and trying too hard to be clever and catchy… “Live. Laugh. Labneh&#8221;… “Can&#8217;t-put-downable labneh”… it&#8217;s a little forced. To its credit, it does have some attitude to it that establishes it as a challenger brand and gives it some confidence out of the gate.</p>

<p>The packaging is pretty great, with an eye-catching design thanks to its bright colors, bold typography, and textured illustrations. Even the shape of the container is kind of unique, especially when contrasted with its main spread rival — hummus — where most brands come in circular containers. The best part of the packaging for me are the illustrations, with their stipple effect for the shadows and highlights, which is an effect that is particularly impressive in the Plain variation as it literally whips up a texture from nothing, unlike the Everything and Red Pepper variations where at least there is an object to play off from. The one thing that my eye keeps being drawn to and not necessarily in a good way is how the logo has been adapted to sit on a curve with the “B” looking like it&#8217;s melting… it&#8217;s a tough challenge for sure so I sympathize with Red Antler and, in the end, it&#8217;s fine. The starbursts and banners and supporting typography all work really well and make each package look like a little party.</p>

<p class="end">Things take a wild turn with the hard flash photography as it completely shifts the tone from fun and good-natured to deadpan and urban. Some photos almost look like crime scene pictures of the victim&#8217;s last meal before they were murdered by a vampire. The candles, the dark rooms, the loose artichoke, the forced posing… it&#8217;s all very odd and uncomfortable. Or maybe it&#8217;s just me… dunno. Overall, lifestyle photography aside, this is a fun, feel-good, yummy-looking logo and packaging that makes this outlier spread look like it deserves a seat at the table.</p>
