That&#8217;s why we use wholesome ingredients, cooked as you would at home, to make truly delicious food for kids. Little Dish has been the pioneer of fresh food for kids for 20 years, and now has an award-winning range of healthy ready meals for children aged one to ten years old, available in supermarkets nationwide.&#8221;</p>

                                            <p><strong>Relevant quote</strong><br /><em>Our goal was to evolve the identity into a narratively driven design ecosystem – a welcoming and relatable draw for kids and a useful tool for parents. This world is formed around a new family of fantastical animals, each elevated with the ‘main character energy’ needed to grab attention and deliver engaging experiences, imbued with unique personality traits and playful props.<br /><br />The foundations of brand recognition and personality have been enhanced by the creation of a literal ‘Little Dish’ icon, carrying a shelf blocking purple brand colour and overflowing with reassuringly vibrant and healthy ingredients. Together, these elements form the basis of a visual identity ready to help families have happier, healthier mealtimes.

                                            <p><strong>Opinion</strong><br />
                                            I'm trying to understand the link of the speech bubble to the name of the brand in the old logo but I'm not sure if there is any relation or maybe I'm just missing something obvious. In any case, as a logo, it was fun and engaging with the circular speech bubble holding the wordmark and both sporting a rugged texture. The new logo maintains the typographic composition — which is quite nice as “little” nestles so perfectly within the ascenders — but cleans up the edges for a smoother finish and places the name within a dish filled with nutritious vegetables. The vegetables are important in this composition as it means that the container that “little dish” lives within is actually a big dish, so there is a nice subtle playfulness to it, aside from being a more relevant choice than a speech bubble.<span></span> The old packaging was arguably fine and perhaps validated the speech bubble as the animal illustration in each variety told you what the product was, which was a little disconcerting in its own right: “Hey, I'm a chicken, you are about to eat me!”. The illustrations were maybe a little old school, like from a classic children's book and the supporting type was maybe too child-like, which, I get it, it's a product for children so it makes sense but as a parent I might be a little turned off by its cliché-ness.<span></span> The new packaging replaces the edible animals with a new crew of animals people don't eat (or at least not regularly) as dinosaurs, elephants, polar bears, and turtles now roam on the packaging and interact with the logo (which cleverly updates the contents of the dish to reflect the ingredients). The supporting typography, <a href="https://www.sharptype.co/typefaces/doyle" target="_blank">Doyle</a> (also used in the logo), works so much better than the old hand-drawn look while providing a much more polished (yet still fun) presence. Overall, this has the right balance of child-like joy and wonder with the understanding that parents are the ones choosing it in the end so it still has to have some level of maturity and sophistication that is satisfyingly conveyed by all of the different elements at play here.</p>

                                            <p>A trio of bottles of all shapes, sizes, and colors this week, with work from Carluke, New York, and Vancouver.</p>

<h1 class="friday_likes">MilHòc by My Creative</h1>
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/friday_likes_milhoc.jpg" alt="MilHòc by My Creative" />

<p style="margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;"><a href="https://www.instagram.com/whiskymilhoc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MilHòc</a> — which translates as “Corn” in Gascon — is a French single-grain whisky distilled in the village of Peyrehorade in the Armagnac region in Southwester, France, where Armagnac brandy is produced (so they are in good company). The packaging, designed by Carluke, Scotland-based <a href="https://wearemycreative.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">My Creative</a>, draws inspiration from the distillery&#8217;s terroir where, among other crop fields and in between ridges and furrows, the whisky&#8217;s corn field lies in the middle and is abstractly represented in the bottle&#8217;s label, highlighted in a copper foil stamp. The serif wordmark, echoes the angular design of the terroir while adding a sense of luxury. Not that it needs much, given the lovely custom bottle with ridges on the sides to allude to the terroir once again but also to the shape of the still while featuring the lovely monogram in raised glass at the bottom of the front of the bottle. A bonus, subtle feature is the lovely paper that the labels are printed on, which has an earthy, rugged texture that further links the product to the soil it comes from. <span class="pagination_divider"></span><span class="small_caps"><a href="https://wearemycreative.com/milhoc-whisky" target="_blank" rel="noopener">See full project</a></span></p>

<h1 class="friday_likes">Edmond’s Honor by Vault49</h1>
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/friday_likes_edmondshonor.jpg" alt="Edmond’s Honor by Vault49" />

<p style="margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;"><a href="https://edmondshonor.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Edmond’s Honor</a> is a new premium bourbon whiskey developed by <a href="https://www.pronghorn.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pronghorn</a>, a company that fosters “the next generation of entrepreneurs, executive leaders and founders within the spirits industry through sustainable investment, incubation and recruitment”. The packaging, designed by New York, NY-based <a href="https://www.vault49.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vault49</a>, features a custom bottle where an abstract depiction of an orchid of the genus Vanilla is raised and a die-cut label in the shape of a hand reaches for it. It&#8217;s not a gratuitous design as the whisky is named after <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmond_Albius" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Edmond Albius</a>, who, despite being born into slavery, at the age of 12 revolutionized vanilla cultivation by hand-pollinating orchids. Abstracting hands is never easy but this one is quite successfully done and the typography and other graphic elements flow naturally within. The contrast of the black hand rising from the white label on top of the copper-colored spirit and accentuated by gold is all kinds of satisfying. <span class="pagination_divider"></span><span class="small_caps"><a href="https://www.vault49.com/work/edmonds-honor" target="_blank" rel="noopener">See full project</a></span>

<h1 class="friday_likes">Vigie by Glasfurd &amp; Walker</h1>
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/friday_likes_vigie.jpg" alt="Vigie by Glasfurd &amp; Walker" />

<p style="margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:30px!important;"><a href="https://drinkvigie.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vigie</a> is a limoncello crafted in California that aims to capture “the essence of European leisure with a dash of revelry and a touch of splendor”. The packaging, designed by Vancouver, BC-based <a href="https://glasfurdandwalker.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Glasfurd &amp; Walker</a>, brings a Mediterranean flair to the U.S. West Coast through a lovely high-contrast, sans serif wordmark and a charming sun illustration. While both elements are excellent in their own regard I think the highlight of the bottle is the contrast of the perfectly chosen green hue and the bright yellow liquid within the stour bottle. It looks criminally refreshing. <span class="pagination_divider"></span><span class="small_caps"><a href="https://glasfurdandwalker.com/project/vigie/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">See full project</a></span></p>

Now with more than 145,000 agents in nearly 9,000 offices and a presence in more than 110 countries and territories, nobody in the world sells more real estate than REMAX, as measured by total residential transaction sides.&#8221;</p>

                                            <p><strong>Relevant quote</strong><br /><em>Why the update? Lee explained that because the vast majority of homebuyers and sellers start their real estate journeys online, it’s important to have a modern design that stands out and is impossible to scroll past. Over 75% of consumers, she added, say they judge a business’s credibility by its design and visual appeal. Refreshing the digital logo is yet another way RE/MAX aims to give affiliates an edge when it comes to securing listings.<br /><br />Taking their creativity even higher, affiliates can place an image between “RE” and “MAX.” The flexibility puts agents “in the center of the conversation,” Lee says.<br /><br />With the strategic digital-first approach, RE/MAX affiliates can download new resources and incorporate them into their social marketing. Physical assets – such as yard signs and other in-real-life branding measures – are not part of the digital-first launch. The refreshed branding and the existing branding will work in tandem to maintain – and increase – the network’s industry-leading positions in brand awareness, recognition and trust.

                                            <p><strong>Opinion</strong><br />
                                            Released in February of this year, I was waiting to see if something else would pop up about the new logo but nothing too relevant has and I keep getting tips about it so I guess it's time to tackle it. (Side note: I also keep getting tips about <a href="https://www.pwc.com/us/en/about-us/newsroom/press-releases/brand-evolution-at-the-forefront-of-change.html" target="_blank">PWC</a> but that one I can confirm will come with a full case study later this year.) The previous logo, introduced in 2017 was the first change for RE/MAX after 44 years of having the same logo so you would have thought it would last a little longer than 8 years and be given some more time to simmer, which it already had begun doing thanks to the omnipresent For Sale signs around the world sporting a RE/MAX logo. The old logo wasn't great by any means and it lost the 1970s-esque exuberance of the original but it was clean, crisp, easily reproducible, and better suited for digital applications. Apparently, though, not enough as the main mission of the new logo is to be even more <em>digital-first</em>.<span></span> The new logo brings together the two well-known elements – the balloon and the slashed wordmark — of the RE/MAX brand together in the reverse hierarchy that it had done so in the past where the wordmark was embedded within a larger balloon rendering (shown in the images above). Now, the balloon has been abstracted into a two-color rendition — five-color if we are being technical (and we should be) — that is actually not bad. Amazingly, it reads effortlessly as “RE/MAX” but also, for those with blurry vision or not paying attention, it also reads as “PEPSI”. The slash has disappeared and is now only implied in the wordmark through the slicing of the “E” and “M” that, paired with the new deployment of it in black, feels oddly aggressive. The super tight spacing also adds to a feeling of discomfort and crowdedness that seems counterproductive to the idea of selling a place to comfortably live in. To its credit, the logo does have a strong, bold, and I guess (I say as I roll my eyes) digital-first presence.<span></span> Here is the crazy part though, this new digital-first logo is ONLY meant to live online on agents' websites and social media but their physical applications — those yard signs — will NOT use the new logo and must use the old balloon logo as RE/MAX has made the strategic decision that the “The refreshed branding and the existing branding will work in tandem to maintain – and increase – the network’s industry-leading positions in brand awareness, recognition and trust.” Having two different logos operating at the same time — ON PURPOSE — is the opposite of building “brand awareness, recognition and trust” but maybe they have figured out a new strategy that has eluded the rest of us for decades.<span></span> There is almost nothing to see in application, which is why I ended up pulling some less than stellar examples from social media. The one image that shows some sample compositions for agents to use in social media are actually kind of okay, with the bold colors and typography and dramatic layouts while the premise that the logo can open up to include imagery between “RE” and “MAX” is lightly interesting. Overall, the logo is technically fine but it strongly shifts the personality of RE/MAX into something more extroverted and in-your-face, which may not be a completely bad thing but the fact that this will coexist with the existing, softer and more demure balloon logo is a literal case of multiple personality disorder.</p>

Established in 1977 as a maker of performance insoles for professional skiers, <a href="https://www.superfeet.com/ " target="_blank" rel="noopener">Superfeet</a> 
now makes a variety of performance insoles for many different activities. In an effort to tap back into their roots of “biomechanical innovation” and attract a younger, more diverse audience, Superfeet has launched a new logo and brand identity designed by New York City-based <a href="https://mltinyc.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MLTI NYC</a>.

<blockquote>
Together with Superfeet, we grounded the brand transformation in a new positioning statement: Performance Amplified. This philosophy elevates Superfeet from a product-first company to a brand-led enterprise that helps people perform their best in everything they do on their feet—starting with the Sport Athlete at the apex and extending to the Industrial Athlete and City Athlete.

<p>
The old logo, up until now, seems to have remained largely unchanged since at least 1996 (the earliest iteration I could hunt down—shout out to that absolutely iconic webpage). While formally, it was pretty bad—the kerning on “feet” is unhinged—it did have a certain solidity-meets-speed-meets-support feel that isn’t necessarily wrong for the product, and I’ll admit that until I saw the old logo and put two and two together, I had not recognized Superfeet in its new iteration for the established brand that it is (one that I had, until now, associated mostly with women in ugly &#8217;80s heels and the elderly). And to that point, the original logo felt truly outdated (and not in the cool retro Y2K way the kids are into these days).
</p>
<p>
The new logo, gratefully, is a complete departure from its predecessor. Set in a bold uppercase italic sans with some <em>Star-Wars</em>-ian ligatures, it feels modern and confidently speedy, immediately drawing associations with big name performance sports brands like Nike or New Balance. While the approach is fairly expected (all caps italic sans in black and bright green doesn’t exactly set it apart in the <a href="https://enertor.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">competitive landscape</a>), the logo itself exhibits a kind of a timeless quality, and the attention to detail—the swash of the “R” dipping below the baseline, the clean corners and edges, the thoughtful kerning—give it a polished edge that makes you think this brand might do more than just make bits of plastic to put in your shoes.
</p>

<blockquote>
The new Superfeet logo features bold italic letterforms that suggest speed, forward momentum, and confidence with unexpected curvilinear details that add warmth and fluidity. Ligatures between letterforms speak to unification: foot and insole, body and product, science and motion. The typography further leans into the biomechanical theme. Secondary and tertiary type treatments use fonts like Fira Mono and adopt a technical, science lab aesthetic with scattered microtype and labeling details that feel like annotations from a research report. 
The color palette introduces &#8220;Super Green,&#8221; a vibrant neon derived from the brand&#8217;s best-selling insole. Now amplified for memorability and energy, it is supported by black, white, and warm neutrals for balance and sophistication.

I always find it tragic when a brand with a multi-decade legacy throws all its history (i.e. equity) out the window, so it’s nice to see that Superfeet has held onto some version of its iconic green (neon-ified, of course, for the 21st century), and the addition of the tan is a nice touch that softens and brings a bit of modern nuance to the identity. The logo variations are exactly what you’d expect but very well executed, the stacked logo pleasantly balanced and the monogram injecting an extra sporty punch (and earning bonus points for the cool repeat pattern). The approach to typography works fine here but generally feels uninspired; Proxima Nova as the primary typeface just feels like a non-decision, and though I am actually still fully on board with the all caps monospace subheader trend that has managed to stick around for what feels like an age, it’s the most obvious solution for conveying “science” and I wonder if they could have pushed it further.

The design language draws from a lab-inspired visual vernacular, with panel backdrops, motion-tracking devices, and reference monitors all inspired by the brand&#8217;s actual testing lab setup, instilling a sense of credibility and precision rooted in real biomechanics. MTLI NYC also introduced a series of graphic elements like grids, dot matrices, and X-ray-style overlays that evoke measurement, data, and anatomical mapping. Taken together, the visual cues speak to the technical process of how Superfeet assesses and enhances movement.

Aesthetically, I like the graphic treatments, and they do a lot to signal “high tech performance” at a glance. Beyond said glance, it starts to feel a bit like fluff — you’re not actually gleaning any real information from the grids and matrices and “x-rays” — but ultimately, the vibes are right. Some of the more lifestyle-focused approaches even start to lend the brand a bit of edgier streetwear flavor, although I get the sense that they’re one misstep away from veering into “how do you do, fellow kids” territory.
</p>
<p>
The product is clean and simple and, well, exactly what you would expect insoles to look like. The logo is where the logo goes. The colors are sporty and subtly gender-coded. They look like bits of plastic you put in your shoes, and no amount of CGI robot hands is going to change that.

<p>
The applications all come together nicely— the billboard is an especially good example of all the elements cohering to build a clear and appealing picture of the brand and the product offering, and the swag and environmental branding are all clean and attractive and perfectly on brand. As far as strategic messaging goes, the “powered by” line makes sense and looks good, but feels a little lacking in depth and creativity. The data-driven, human-related statistics offered up in the wheatpaste example start to put some substance behind the science aesthetics, but I would have liked to see much more of that approach to better shore up the brand strategically.

<p>
(And circling back to building off historic brand equity—huge missed opportunity not to have revived the 2000s <a href="https://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/superfeet_old_ID_2000.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“Do Your Feet Hurt” graphic</a> for that neon green tote.)

<p>
The brand video looks great and does a nice job showing the breadth of uses for the product, but it would have been much more effective overlaid with some snappy instrumental music rather than the cringeworthy, over-emotive fluffy narration that reeks of idealistic late stage capitalistic ick.
</p>
<p class="end">
While there’s no doubt that this new identity represents a massive upgrade for Superfeet, I find myself a little underwhelmed at the end of it. It gets major style points for aesthetics and polish, but for a brand that uses the words “revolutionary” and “innovation” as two thirds of its tagline, there was nothing about the identity that surprised or challenged me, and the overall strategic approach felt underbaked— it’s trying so hard to be inspirational, but never quite established the substance to back up those lofty ideals. At the end of the day, I don’t need to be sold <em>Chasing. My. Best. Self.</em> I just want my feet to hurt less.
