Taking cues from other Walt Disney Company digital platforms like Disney+, Marvel, Star Wars, and Hulu, the resulting animation is particularly reminiscent of the latter but is certainly distinctive thanks to its color palette and subtle inclusion of the iconic <em>SportsCenter</em> “DaDaDa, DaDaDa” theme.

For over one hundred years the Scout Movement has contributed to building a better world through the personal commitment of hundreds of millions of young people living up to their Scout Promise. Scouting’s mission is to contribute to the education of young people through a value system based on the Scout Promise and Law and to help build a better world where people are self-fulfilled as individuals and play a constructive role in society.&#8221;</p>

The iconic fleur-de-lis emblem, the ‘purple thread’ running through Scouting life, which has been unchanged for 54 years, has been sensitively evolved for a more digital age.

                                            Few brands confuse me as much as “Scouts”, with so many local, regional, national, and global organizations carrying the name and some variation on the fleur-de-lis emblem. Case in point: today we are talking about World Scouting which is not exactly the same as the World Organization of the Scout Movement except that it is — but I wouldn't know because, as mentioned, I'm confused — and is definitely not the same as <a href="https://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/new_logo_and_identity_for_the_scouts_association_by_notonsunday.php" target="_blank">The Scouts Association</a>. Further causing me confusion, World Scouting now uses one form of the fleur-de-lis emblem but it's actually one ring lower under the Master World Scout Emblem reserved for the World Organization of the Scout Movement except that when you Google that name and go to the primary website, the World Scouting logo shows up. If you are now as confused as me, my job here is done. Let's get to the actual design in front of us, though.<span></span> The new logo for World Scouting reduces the amount of elements in it for a cleaner and more easily reproducible icon. The drawing is very nicely executed and now existing always in a circle it becomes more iconic literally and is easier to use in different colors whereas previously the logo only worked when used white on dark colors and reversing it <a href="https://prod-cms.scouts.org.uk/media/2135/wordscoutmembershipbadges.jpg" target="_blank">meant exchanging the highlights for the shadows or placing it inside a circle where the knot of the rope got in the way and created an awkward composition</a>. To bring back some confusion, the <a href="https://brand.scout.org/document/1#/master-world-scout-emblem/our-emblem/download-the-world-scout-emblem" target="_blank">Master World Scout Emblem</a> does keep the rope and the two stars (one for truth, one for knowledge, TIL) and follows the new, minimalist approach. Back to World Scouting… the new wordmark has some fun curves and manages to be just the right amount of customization before getting a little too wacky.<span></span> For the identity, a new series of shapes and “stitches” — inspired by knots, patches, and neckerchiefs — enliven the applications with a lot of texture and playfulness that provide ample flexibility for the organization, at all levels, to generate their own communications. I really like the idea of the stitches and it's so close to working really well but something about their applications seems a little timid when used as single strands and a little too chaotic when used as a pattern. The choice of <a href="https://www.grillitype.com/typeface/gt-planar" target="_blank">GT Planar</a> may be a little off as it feels too corporate and stiff and the way it's deployed in the mock-ups is neither consistent nor particularly exciting. Overall, this may be leaning a little too much into NGO, nonprofit, charity territory and is maybe missing some connection to the main audience — the youth — but there is definitely potential here and it's probably a matter of time before the system finds its footing.</p>

Originally founded through Y Combinator and named YC Research — which helped spur OpenAI, among others — the organization operates independently from the well-known incubator and changed its name in 2020 to better make that distinction. Since its founding, it has incubated several notable projects, including Human Advancement Research Community (HARC) led by Alan Kay, Dynamicland led by Bret Victor, and the Unconditional Cash Study led by Elizabeth Rhodes, which is the current main focus of the organization. Partnering with individuals, nonprofits, and institutional partners, their aim is to share findings and insights widely and make their data sets available to benefit the research community. Recently, OpenResearch introduced a new identity designed by San Francisco, CA-based <a href="https://play.studio/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Play</a>.</p>

<blockquote>In developing their brand identity, we took visual inspiration from the multilayered paper trail of the research world. Documents, sticky notes, and messy bulletin boards all informed our design which blends academic rigor with an entrepreneurial spirit. We wanted to capture the inquisitive passion propelling the human search for answers.<br /><br />The OpenResearch logomark symbolizes the diverse, multi-dimensional collection of sources that drive their highly collaborative research. Its upward tilt nods to OpenResearch’s optimism for the future.</blockquote><h3><a href="https://play.studio/work/openresearch" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Play project page</a></h3>

<p>Whether on purpose, by accident, or by coincidence, the icon in the old logo managed to look both like an “R” and like an abstract human figure (head and shoulders) AND its overall shape was an “O” <em>AND</em> it was literally open. The execution wasn&#8217;t great but it somehow managed to tick a lot of correct boxes. The wordmark was fine but too generic. The new logo interprets the word “open” in a slick way through the new icon that renders an “O” through a series of parallel, widely spaced lines. It manages to have plenty of dimension too and present the abstract “O” as en extruded cylinder thanks to the modulation in length of the lines, which is a pretty cool and elegant optical illusion. The concept behind it, that it represents the “collection of sources that drive their highly collaborative research”, is valid and it pays off in the animation. The wordmark, typeset in <a href="https://commercialtype.com/catalog/atlas_grotesk" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Atlas Grotesk</a>, looks pretty slick in its light weight and mildly condensed structure.</p>

<blockquote>The color palette draws on a mix of muted and vibrant hues common in papers, inks and sticky notes. Colors like coral, ochre and honeydew imbue the brand with an exploratory feel consistent with OpenResearch’s work. Black and white bring a sense of rigor and seriousness.</blockquote><h3><a href="https://play.studio/work/openresearch" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Play project page</a></h3>

<p>The identity has a lot of great elements, starting with the dark, pastel-y color palette that stops short of the all-the-colors-in-the-rainbow approach and its muted hues vibe really well together. The primary type choice of <a href="https://klim.co.nz/retail-fonts/national-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">National 2</a> isn&#8217;t the most groundbreaking as it&#8217;s a very popular type family but I really like how they stick to a single, medium weight and the supporting <a href="https://commercialtype.com/catalog/atlas" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Atlas Grotesk and Atlas Typewriter</a> make for great complements. The hero elements are the collages that combine two images — one as a regular photograph or render and one as a posterized duotone — through a torn paper composition. They are simple yet full of texture and they are able to illustrate a variety of subjects in an engaging way while being very cohesive. You can see many of them bigger on OpenResearch&#8217;s website.</p>

<p>The applications are really great, mostly thanks to the perfectly deployed typography and how well it combines with the collages through very straightforward layouts. The website in particular is typographically delicious, especially when there is more of Atlas Typewriter… just some really great typesetting and modulation of sizes to define hierarchy of information. I also like the use of the icon floating on its own in some of the applications. In general, nothing groundbreaking but the ingredients are so good that it doesn&#8217;t need much more design horsepower to work.</p>

The winning design by local, 69-year-old artist Lori Caccamo, displays “the iconic Fox Theatre towers over a smaller building and farmland in front of the Sierra Nevada and rising sun.” Caccamo received $1,500 and a bouquet of flowers. The original logo will still be used when its details can be displayed at the appropriate size. It was a good run for this story.

                                            <p><strong>Relevant quote</strong><br /><em>Taking cues from engineering and heavy industry, a modern three-dimensional logo spells FM in angular, titanium beams that connote engineering and protection. In shades of stone against a dark, rich, yet calming steel background, the letters are accented by orange. Their faceted structure communicates the strength and premium nature of a diamond.<br /><br />The precise, faceted structure was designed to speak to FM’s innovative, engineering-led approach. The combined forms of the “F” and the “M” was designed to demonstrate the organization’s unity and partnership. This new logo effectively connects F and M. Instead of a step denoting the left side of the M, the top of the F transitions into the M shape – as if the M is embracing the F. Because this creates a precise 2:1 ratio, the logo can be scaled without any adjustments.<br /><br />Prophet worked with Commercial Type to customize their fonts Algebra Display, and Review. The new fonts are  FM Algebra and FM Review. FM’s new colors build off the steel of the logo with primary colors Orange, Steel (navy) and Stone (warmer lighter grays).  The orange is used to give depth and warmth to the steel of the logo and in video, animation and signage it backlights the FM. Prophet updated the entire look and feel of the FM brand with guidelines and systems that create ownable 3D Graphics, Iconography, Illustration, Data Visualization and Layouts - used by FM in its marketing, client communications, sales materials, signage and more.

                                            <p><strong>Opinion</strong><br />
                                            The old logo was a vibe, with one mint or pink hue away from screaming 1980s but it was also pretty bad, with three completely unrelated elements, except, arguably, for the fact that they were all condensed. The new logo is a drastic change, making it look like old and new are two completely different companies servicing completely different industries. The new logo is hardcore and industrial, conveying a literal strong sense of solidity in what they do. Before adding the chiseled effect, the structure of the new “FM” monogram is actually pretty cool, clever, and unexpected. While I would normally advocate for a flat design, I do think the volume of the facets helps a lot with the readability of the two letters and without it, the “FM” could have been very lackluster and potentially very awkward. The final rendering is a bit odd though, with the very thin stroke around the letterforms and the white strokes in the apices of the chisels. Both things seem unnecessary.<span></span> For the identity, the typography goes in an unexpected and untrendy direction with the choice of Commercial Type's <a href="https://commercialtype.com/catalog/algebra" target="_blank">Algebra</a>, which is a really nice, editorial-esque slab serif that would probably compete with any other logo but since the titanium FM is so much its own “thing”, Algebra's peculiarities can also shine. It also provides a way of conveying corporate-ness in a more interesting way. Not much in application and what's there is kind of generic but it's arguably fine. In the hardhat and jacket we also get a glimpse at a flat, 2-color solution to the logo and it works mostly well but in the first stroke of the “M” I think the shadow should be on the upper part. Overall, this may lean a little too hard on an industrial, steel-producing aesthetic more so than insurance but it's still good to see a design approach that skirts the edge of the box to think just right outside of it with some unexpected design decisions.</p>

<blockquote>Embracing a dynamic pace of change, anticipating future opportunities, and remaining firmly rooted in a core mission, we brought a full-spectrum brand to life. The strapline ‘full spectrum care, for a full spectrum life’ unlocked creative opportunity for the identity while directly communicating the offering and impact Spectrum.Life has on people’s lives.<br /><br />‘Full spectrum care’ captures the multitude services of care across digital health, mental health, and wellbeing. ‘Full spectrum life’ captures the ability to engage, empower, and transform lives across diverse experiences.<br /><br />Drawing inspiration from the analogy of the spectrum of light – and leaning into their evocative name – a ‘spectrum’ device was placed at the heart of the brand. This prompted a visual identity composed of different colours, frequencies and shapes, but all part of one unified system. Using this metaphor with multiple spectrums, we captured the many ways Spectrum.Life supports a myriad of lives and experiences.<br /><br />The Spectrum.Life logo is a modified wordmark, where a custom ‘m’ mimics the wave and wobble of the ‘spectrum’ device. Using Raptor V3 for the wordmark and main display type conveys professionalism, modernity, and approachability, while providing legibility and versatility across various media.</blockquote><h3><a href="https://unitedus.co.uk/work/spectrum-life/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">UnitedUs project page</a></h3>

<p>The old logo wasn&#8217;t good but it wasn&#8217;t supper offensive either. By trying to minimize the real estate it needed, though, it ended up with a very awkward and unbalanced composition and the large period fought for attention with the small, textured heart. Having written this out, I guess it <em>was</em> sort of offensive. The new logo embraces the length of the name and renders everything in a single, tightly typeset line with a relatively wide icon to boot. The wordmark makes for a friendly and nice first impression but maybe it was customized a little too much. Using <a href="https://www.superiortype.com/fonts/raptor-v3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Raptor V3</a> as a basis, some letters have been trimmed on their terminals, descenders and ascenders shortened, and the “t” given a little extra curve on its crossbar. All of these subtle changes take some attention away from the groovy “m”, which would have been enough of a customization.</p>

<p>The “m” could have also been exaggerated a little more to replace the need for an additional icon altogether and I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if, in an earlier exploration, the icon lived where the “m” is now. Nonetheless, I do like the addition of the icon as it provides a nice balance with the “m” and I really like the various spectrum icons they&#8217;ve come up with and how easily they can switch between them for the logo and for other messaging. Their animation could be just a tad smoother on the curves but it&#8217;s certainly energetic and its upward movement optimistic. The shorthand version is a fun rebus only if you know the name of the company and are familiar with its brand assets, which isn&#8217;t a bad thing, it just means it needs to be deployed &#8220;deeper” in the identity system and user experience vs. being used in first-contact uses like ads.</p>

<blockquote>‘Full spectrum colour’ personifies the vivid experiences, radiant outlook and impactful services that Spectrum.Life deliver. Colour also plays a pivotal role in flexing to specific audiences. Whether using neutral colours for insurer audiences to imagine their own brand being the hero, engaging workplace audiences with a bold purple, or ramping up vibrancy for diverse education audiences, the Spectrum.Life brand is always prepared to communicate across the full spectrum.</blockquote><h3><a href="https://unitedus.co.uk/work/spectrum-life/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">UnitedUs project page</a></h3>

<p>Another interpretation of “spectrum” is an oversize, extra wavy circle that lives in the background, spinning and morphing its contour while a spectrum of colors also do their own dance within and are rendered in grainy, wavy gradients. In principle, I would say it&#8217;s too much but in the opposite of principle, I very much enjoy that treatment and I&#8217;m digging the way they use it with photography by placing it between a subject and a background. The typography uses Raptor V3 out of the box, so there is both synergy and dissonance with the logo given the customizations on the wordmark where they look related but don&#8217;t share the same details. It&#8217;s fine though… the type looks good. It&#8217;s a little serious, a little playful, and it&#8217;s inviting.</p>

<p>The applications are all good. I particularly like the ad with the person swimming and interacting with the messaging and iconography… it literally looks full of life. There is also a good flexibility to the system in using the wobbly, spectrum-y contours as holding shapes in different ways and the grainy gradients do add some welcome texture across touchpoints, from advertising to the app.</p>

<p class="end">If it wasn&#8217;t clear what Spectrum.Life is or does (as it was to me) the long-ish video above does do a good job in giving a better picture of what you actually get from it. Would have loved to see some of the system applied to it. Overall, an optimistic and lively identity that bridges the needs of the corporations and institutions that hire its services with a polished and slightly serious look and the experience and expectations of the end-users with an approachable and relatively fun attitude.</p>
