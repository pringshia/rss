                                            <p>(Est. 2016) &#8220;<a href="https://pienso.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pienso</a> helps connect data and technology in an accessible way for experts who have the subject insights to use both fully. To our team, it’s also a bridge to the AI-powered world that anyone can cross – and to a community where everyone is welcome to experiment, create, and learn. While exploring AI-based content moderation in the MIT labs, Karthik Dinakar and Birago Jones realized that what was most needed was a way to put human expertise back in the loop. They envisioned a simple point-and-click interface that would enable experts in any field to interact with machine learning – without dependence on developers, and without losing any of their hard-won insights. In 2016, they created Pienso, with the aim of becoming the leading machine learning platform for non-programmers. Within one year, the company had raised seed funding from Eniac Ventures, Uncork, Indicator Ventures and MIT E14 Fund. Now headquartered in Arlington, VA / DC, Pienso works with governments, media companies, pharmaceutical companies and all kinds of other knowledge industries to help their specialists use and train language models.&#8221;</p>

                                            <p><strong>Relevant quote</strong><br /><em>The design team created a graphically reductive identity to make Pienso’s features easy to grasp, with striking, colourful elements to engage the audience and communicate the learning-through-play nature of Pienso’s product. At its core the identity is stripped-back, but results in a bold and purposeful design that challenges the notion that AI is just ‘black-box magic’.<br /><br />At the heart of the brand is a visual narrative that tells the story of Pienso’s software platform. The digital product’s features are manifested as interchangeable modular tools, represented by simple geometric blocks in the vibrant brand colours. Throughout the identity these blocks are shown in various totemic combinations, highlighting the adaptable, bespoke solutions Pienso offers.<br /><br />Pienso’s existing logo, consisting of three aligned prisms, was retained but updated to be more cohesive and to create alignment with both the form language of the coloured blocks and the new, bespoke wordmark. All three elements communicate approachability, balanced but purposeful playfulness, and a level of design sophistication reminiscent of mid-century design craft.

                                            <p><strong>Opinion</strong><br />
                                            The icon in the old logo was great, conveying dimensionality in a relatively unique way through the shifts in color helping define the cube shape. I even like the muted colors against black… a good mix of ominous and optimistic. The wordmark, a spurless sans, was terrible and had zero visual relation to the icon. Thew new logo retains the essence of the old icon but, unfortunately, strips it from the few things that made it interesting and now it simply looks like a flat hexagon shape that makes Pienso look <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90756090/crypto-logos-design-hexagon-bitcoin" target="_blank">like it operates in the crypto category</a>. The wordmark is an improvement but it's not necessarily good as, like its predecessor, there is no visual relationship between icon and wordmark, especially now with the super pronounced circular letterforms as the “P” becomes far too distracting and the stemless “n” draws unnecessary attention too.<span></span> As with most identities for AI companies and products, it then becomes a free-for-all in terms of how to interpret what they do and how that manifests visually with no right or wrong answer given that the premises of most of these are so hard to grasp. In this particular case, the “digital product’s features are manifested as interchangeable modular tools, represented by simple geometric blocks in the vibrant brand colours” — random and gratuitous but, sure, why not?<span></span> The resulting shapes are quite pleasing, with a matte texture and a funky combination of forms in an eye-catching color palette. The soft bevels of the shapes have a decent synergy with the rounded corners in the icon but, even then, each element feels like it's operating on its own and icon, wordmark, shapes, and colors just happened to be in the same room and then Helvetica Now walked in on them. Old icon in new color palette, though? That would have been cool. Overall, despite some apprehensions about the meaning of it all, this is a slick-looking identity and while it doesn't quite “make Pienso’s features easy to grasp” it does make Pienso's features <em>fun</em> to try to figure out what the hell they are talking about (at least as an outsider).</p>

<blockquote>Partnering with Jones Knowles Ritchie (JKR), Mozilla is set to revamp its brand and reimagine its digital future. Central to this transformation is leading with the Mozilla name, ensuring the organization is recognized for its broader impact, not just for Firefox. This refreshed brand architecture cements Mozilla’s role as a beacon of digital rights and innovation, putting people over profits through privacy-preserving products, open-source developer resources, and community-building efforts, empowering everyone to choose their own digital destiny.<br /><br />The new brand was developed with this in mind, incorporating insights from employees and the broader Mozilla community, involving diverse voices as well as consultation with agency experts to ensure the brand authentically represented Mozilla’s values with fresh, objective perspectives.</blockquote><h3>Jones Knowles Ritchie provided text</h3>

The flag can transform into a more literal interpretation as its new mascot, in ASCII art style, and serve as a rallying cry for Mozilla&#8217;s cause.</blockquote><h3>Jones Knowles Ritchie provided text</h3>

<p>As some of you might remember, Mozilla had <a href="https://www.underconsideration.com/brandnewconference/video/downloads/michael-johnson-tim-murray/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a thoroughly well documented redesign</a> in 2016 where they went through an open design process with <a href="https://www.johnsonbanks.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Johnson Banks</a>, giving its community the opportunity to provide feedback on everything from strategy to logo to visual and verbal language. <a href="https://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/new_logo_for_mozilla_by_johnson_banks.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The resulting logo and identity</a> were surprisingly and amazingly good despite what could have been a train wreck after such a grueling process.</p>

<p>I really liked the old logo, with its clever reference of the “://” element employed to call websites on the internet and the slab serif approach was, at the time (and even now), a welcome respite from the then (and still) popular geometric sans serif trend started by Airbnb and Google. A lot has changed in 8 years, including the fact that you no longer have to ever type “https://” (or “www.” for that matter) to get to a website on any browser so there was definitely starting to be a hint of being antiquated.</p>

<p>The new logo leads with a great new wordmark that feels pretty unique and novel with its pixel-shaped ink traps and funky “a”. I feel like the “z” should have had a similar ink trap treatment as it ends up looking very &#8220;normal&#8221;. Accompanying the wordmark is the hero of the project, a simple icon that doubles — actually triples — as a flag, as an “M”, and as an ode to the early dinosaur logo while conceptually signaling Mozilla&#8217;s trailblazing attitude to forge a new path in the incessantly commerce-driven world wide web and establish at least a small territory free from those forces.</p>

</figure>

<p>While I mentioned that the previous logo was looking dated due to its “http://” protocol element that few people ever use, the icon and its behaviors go back even further in time with a heavily pixelated look and lo-fi, frame-by-frame animations. What I like about this is that it&#8217;s almost like a hard reboot or a restore-to-factory-settings command that takes us back to simpler times and gives us the opportunity to start over again and perhaps not make the internet solely about banner ads served by Google.</p>

<p>In its core state, the flag icon already hinted at the dinosaur but the identity takes this hint to its logical, pixelated extreme and introduces an adorable and super fun dinosaur mascot constructed from the bare minimum amount of pieces. For anyone that doesn&#8217;t know the history of Mozilla and its previous dinosaur logo, this might come across as a very weird flex but if Mozilla has one thing, it is a passionate community that is well versed in Mozilla lore. Even if not, how can you ever be mad at a pixelated dinosaur that makes the ground shake as it roars?</p>

<blockquote>The custom typefaces—Mozilla Semi-Slab, Mozilla Sans, and Mozilla Sans Text—were created in collaboration with <a href="https://studio-drama.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Studio DRAMA</a>. The semi-slab is an evolution of its slab serif today. It stands out in a sea of tech sans. The new interpretation is more innovative and built for its tech platforms. The sans brings character to something that was once hard working but generic. These fonts are interchangeable and allow for a greater degree of expression across its brand experience, connecting everything together.</blockquote><h3>Jones Knowles Ritchie provided text</h3>

<p>I had a bit of a hard time parsing through all the type specimens as there is a confusing amount of different references to the available styles. The press release says there is Mozilla Semi-Slab, Mozilla Sans, and Mozilla Sans Text, but then the specimens say just “slab” or “slab headline” or \ “semi slab” and I just lost track of how slab-y the slabs are or aren&#8217;t and if there is a full slab and a semi slab or not. I dunno. Point being, there are at least two styles going on… one that is more headline-y and one that is more text-paragraph-y. At times, the slab/semi slab looks pretty damn cool but at other times it has a <a href="https://fonts.adobe.com/fonts/museo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Museo</a>-like vibe which is a big turn-off, at least for me. The condensed variations also start to look very different and almost like they belong in another identity. Still, it&#8217;s obviously not just a good extension of the wordmark but it also helps build on the modern pixelated aesthetic.</p>

<p class="end">Nothing in application, unfortunately, not even fake ads under grungy London bridges and I&#8217;m not sure what the one image with layouts actually is… it looks like guidelines but also not and it looks promising but also underwhelming. This is followed by some images of the wordmark and icon on things so it&#8217;s hard to tell how this is going to play out. Overall, there is a strong foundation here with the new distinctive wordmark and a bit of levity and perhaps even pirate rebelliousness in the flag icon that should help galvanize users to (re)build a small segment of the internet into a greed-free zone.</p>

The new design system meets the needs of a digital-first future. Inspired by the bank's iconic design from 25 years ago, the refined design is spearheaded by the separation of the name and boxes from the bank’s previous logo, creating a simpler, more contemporary expression while maintaining recognizability. The introduction of a 'progress bar' symbol and an updated typeface reflects the bank’s mission to drive sustainable progress and reliability as it moves forward in a changing world.

                                            <p><strong>Opinion</strong><br />
                                            Given the size of the bank I am guessing the old logo had significant equity, was easily recognizable, and most likely no one questioned its design but, as an outsider and seeing this logo for the first time, I'll label it as not great and outdated. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurostile" target="_blank">Eurostile</a>-esque typography looks like it hasn't been updated since the 1960s and the uneven spacing around the typography gives me little fits of rage but, as the new logo demonstrates, there was something salvageable in both the typography and the two boxes. Extracted from the latter, the new wordmark is a very nice re-interpretation of the old one, with a more contemporary look, nicer proportions, and a crisper and more defined silhouette for the characters. I'm not a big fan of the loose letter-spacing as it makes the wordmark extra long and I think the heavily squared-off structure of the type would look bad-ass if typeset tighter.<span></span> The old, dusty boxes have been transformed into a pretty slick new graphic device that not only maintains alive the equity of the old logo but serves as a new progress bar motif that has all kinds of positive allegories related to banking and online financial transactions. At times maybe they overdo it on how many behaviors the progress bar can have or what it can do but, at its most simple (as shown in the “sample layouts” video) it becomes an elegant and confident endorsing mark for the bank that is a really cool alternative to the more traditional bank icons like HSBC's or Chase's.<span></span> The layouts and applications could perhaps use a little pick-me-up in terms of making them more engaging or interesting as they start to verge on too minimalist. There is a funky soundwave-like texture that gets used in some places but that's just odd. The wordmark has been extended into a full type family and I would love to see some proper type specimens for it as it looks very promising but, as deployed <a href="https://danskebank.com/" target="_blank">on the website</a>, it feels very timid and doesn't quite show off. Overall,  a serious identity that could have perhaps benefitted from just a bit more nuance and detail in some of the applications but that definitely hints that this is a serious bank for serious people.</p>

                                            <p>Launched in May 2024, <a href="https://daylightcomputer.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Daylight Computer Company</a> is an electronics manufacturer headquartered in San Francisco, CA. The company is focused on the pursuit of <a href="https://lessfoolish.substack.com/p/the-third-timeline" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the third timeline</a>, an ideological framework proposed by Daylight&#8217;s former <a href="https://substack.com/@peterlimberg/p-148505473" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Philosopher-in-Residence Peter N Limberg</a>, which serves as a middle-ground between the conflicting futurist theories of accelerationism and decelerationism. While accelerationists seek to drastically intensify the progression of technology in order to destabilize existing systems to force societal change and decelerationists seek to halt or reverse technological progress in order to protect humanity from the corrupting forces of technology and capitalism, the &#8220;third timeline&#8221; imagines a world in which neither strategy comes to pass, and instead technologies are developed in symbiosis with human life.</p>

<p>To that end, Daylight has recently launched their first product, the DC-1. It is an Android tablet with a black-and-white reflective LCD display, giving it the look of an e-paper device (a la <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=kindle&#038;udm=2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kindle</a>) but with a 60 Hz refresh rate and touch gesture sensitivity that make it perform more like a traditional tablet. Packaged with a pressure sensitive Wacom stylus and a padded case, the DC-1 aims to be an outdoors-first computer optimized for reading, writing, and drawing under direct sunlight. The identity for Daylight was designed by San Francisco-based studio <a href="https://ot.studio/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Office of Ordinary Things</a>.</p>

<figcaption>Daylight Computer Company logo detail.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>There are two logos, a shorthand wordmark with <em>daylight</em> in lower case and a long form <em>DAYLIGHT COMPUTER COMPANY</em> in all caps with an accompanying icon. Both are rendered in a nicely balanced custom geometric sans-serif, in a shade of orange drawn directly from the product design. Given that Daylight is planting their feet firmly in the futurism discussion, I appreciate how their full name fits the cyberpunk formula of innocuous noun + slightly ominous suffix, a la &#8220;Perceptions&#8221; or &#8220;Dynamics&#8221; or &#8220;Industries&#8221; or &#8220;<a href="https://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/new_logo_and_identity_for_ghost_locomotion_by_play.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Locomotion</a>&#8220;.

<p>In the lowercase <em>daylight</em>, it would have been tempting to make the counters of the “d”, “a”, and “g” perfect circles to reference the sun and accentuate the rhythm of the repeating round elements, but I ultimately agree with their decision to keep them ever so slightly squished. It feels more inline with the 70s organic one-with-nature vibe. Pushing it too far in the direction of perfect humanism or perfect geometry would spoil the metaphor.</p>

<p>The <em>DAYLIGHT COMPUTER COMPANY</em> version also has a lot of rhythms that aren&#8217;t overplayed. Reading from the bottom up, you almost get the impression that it could be a monospace font. The AYL of DAYLIGHT briefly breaks you out of the pattern, only for the GHT to settle back in by the end of the word. The COMP(UTER) COMP(ANY) repetition is fun to read both aloud and on the page.</p>

<p>I keep wanting to read the icon as a DCC monogram &#8211; it feels like there should be something there, what with all the curves and there being three of them. My most plausible interpretation is that we&#8217;re seeing three stages of the sun rising or setting, growing or shrinking and cutting diagonally across the icon space. The background elements introduced here are macro photographs of the DC-1&#8217;s display, which is the feature that sets it apart from other tablets and is not only worth of the spotlight, but also just looks cool in closeup, both in it&#8217;s gray/black day and orange/black night variants.</p>

<blockquote>
We created an animation to introduce the new Daylight brand, inspired by their unique philosophy and accompanied by original music. The video is a unique blend of digital and analog, blending the capabilities of modern 3D and animation tools with the warmth and imperfections of hundreds of printed and scanned frames.

<p>If the static icon was vague, the animated version offers no clarification. It&#8217;s a very stylish presentation with the grainy paper texture and the piano with maracas into synth track absolutely slaps, but the dots in a row? Opening up to swallow each other? Then turning into glowing yellow forms against a black void? That&#8217;s Pac-Man. You can&#8217;t tell me that&#8217;s not Pac-Man. I know Pac-Man when I see Pac-Man, and I&#8217;m telling you: that&#8217;s Pac-Man.</p>

<!-- <p>There's a third lockup at the end of this video which doesn't look or feel official, nor does it show up anywhere else in the case study or on the Daylight website. It's a nifty look, all spaced out and futuristic, but I can't help but feel it only exists here to resolve the loop and place the power pellet back at center stage. It feels like poor form to end what is ostensibly an introduction to the logo on something that isn't - strictly speaking - the logo.</p> -->

<figcaption>Sample of brand guidelines.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>In lieu of type specimens or Pantone chips, the excerpt from the brand guidelines provided to us is the principle of Solis Iter, from the Latin for &#8220;path of the sun.&#8221; It may be a bit more abstract than the guidelines we usually get to evaluate, but in light of the much deeper philosophical roots concerning the technological fate of humankind woven throughout this identity, it&#8217;s refreshing to see something as relatively straightforward as &#8220;move the elements like the sun moves and make them the color of sunlight.&#8221; And as on the nose as they seem, those are things you would want to have codified in a solar-centered identity.</p>

<blockquote>
We shot a set of product photos for the DC-1 launch that showcase the product’s unique display and magical glow. Additionally, macro photos capture a magnified view of the screen’s amber backlight, while also providing a source of inspiration for the dot and grid elements of the brand.

<p>In my life I have been an enjoyer of the outdoors, as well as a consumer of Kindles and pen tablets. There&#8217;s an inherent spiritual dirtiness that comes with using a tablet computer on a hiking trail. But I have to admit: the shots of this screen in nature in action wind up feeling about as close to natural as a computer could get. Day-lit shadows of foliage cast across a perfectly crisp, smoothly animated tablet display are exciting. The orange glow of the backlight reads less like a small television and more like a lantern or campfire. Some of the nicest days in my life have been spend sitting on a rock in the woods doodling in a sketchbook. These tableaux are really making me ruminate on what those experiences would be like if my notebook had an undo button and some pinch-to-zoom.</p>

<p>The seeds of the Solis Iter principle of diagonal placement finally sprout in the ad layouts. Being more spread out, I don&#8217;t immediately clock the ad copy as a sunrise/sunset metaphor as easily as I do with the logo icon. But even without that layer, the effect that the diagonal spread has of drawing your eye across a line of action that syncs with the photography is stellar. I don&#8217;t feel as strongly about the dots. They start to read a little less solar when there are too many of them on the page.</p>

<p>Aside from the hero shots of the screen in action, the other thematic elements are allowed to get some play in the packaging and business card photos.

<p>As much as the the third timeline philosophy can be felt throughout all of the health-conscious and lo-fi styling of the brand, it only shows up overtly on the merch. Which makes sense. You want to let the tablet be a tablet first, and a religion only for those who are willing to opt in.</p>

<!-- <p>Accelerationism has been the Silicon Valley buzzword of the Web 3.0 era. Start-ups and venture capitalists alike want to believe that, in addition to making money, they're making the world a better place. But in an era where the impact of climate change looms ever overhead, how do you justify launching yet another crypto or AI project that <a href="https://www.vox.com/climate/2024/3/28/24111721/climate-ai-tech-energy-demand-rising" target="_blank" rel="noopener">consumes the electricity of a small country</a>? Accelerationism. You move fast and break things and hope that freeing yourself from the moral constraints of the present will lead to a solution for the future. -->

<p>Any reader of Brand New is familiar with the mental gymnastics used to justify design decisions. We&#8217;ve all rolled our eyes at a project page blurb. A cool logo might have been made cool just for the sake of coolness, but that isn&#8217;t allowed to show &#8211; the coolness has to mean something. The third timeline idea doesn&#8217;t need to exist for a tech company to make tech products. Daylight made a screen look like paper, but without the painfully slow refresh rate that we&#8217;ve come to expect from e-paper, and that&#8217;s incredible on its own merit. E-paper has remained the domain of ebooks simply because the page of a novel doesn&#8217;t need to move very often to function. They could have just stuck with their earliest messaging, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tU9rBz4jpfE" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&#8220;this is like a Kindle, but faster,&#8221;</a> and they&#8217;d have still been a financial success without the need to dip their toes into futurist morality.</p>

<p class="end">But even if the utopian talk feels a little post-hoc, it&#8217;s an incredibly strong framework to build a brand within. The Office of Ordinary Things have encountered a company with a high-minded philosophy and met them with an identity on their level. Within the Daylight Computer Company universe, the DC-1 is not just a better e-reader. It&#8217;s not even just a lifestyle brand. It&#8217;s a more mindful, more healthy, more sustainable ideology that allows for humanity to continue to engage with technology without veering into an apocalypse. It turns an iPad with a dim screen into a symbol of hope for the future of the human race, a new and glorious dawn.</p>
