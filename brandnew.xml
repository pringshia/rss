Measuring in at 145 inches by 105 inches (roughly 12 by 8 feet), the sign weighs 560 pounds and the winning bidder is responsible for the cost of shipping the sign from its current storage facility in San Francisco to its final destination. I&#8217;m guessing UPS Ground won&#8217;t cut it.

It is a subsidiary of LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton. Benefit was founded by the twin sisters Jean and Jane Ford. Born in Indiana, they attended Indiana University before moving to San Francisco. In 1976, the twins opened a beauty boutique named &#8220;The Face Place&#8221; in San Francisco&#8217;s Mission District. The Fords then focused on department store distribution and renamed the company Benefit Cosmetics in 1990. In 1991, Benefit opened its first U.S. department store in Henri Bendel, located in New York City. In 1997, Benefit went international with its expansion into Harrods in London. LVMH acquired Benefit Cosmetics on September 14, 1999.&#8221; (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benefit_Cosmetics" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wikipedia</a>)</p>

                                            <p><strong>Relevant quote</strong><br /><em>We partnered with Benefit’s creative and executive leadership team to clarify and define the true spirit of the brand and reflect who Benefit is at the core – a brand that believes beauty should lift people up, not bring them down. Together, we landed on a purpose that had always been at the heart of Benefit: to Ignite Joy.<br /><br />As we began to develop Benefit’s parent brand, ‘Ignite Joy’ drove us to take creative inspiration from the playful irreverence of the legendary Memphis Group. We took the best of Benefit’s existing visual identity and modernised it for new contexts.<br /><br />This refreshed identity addresses the duality of the Benefit brand, finding the right balance between its world-class innovation and playful, fun-loving personality.<br /><br />The logo can now abbreviate, reshuffle, and even wink. Pink is now more than a colour swatch – it has presence and attitude. The new graphic language is cheeky – literally. Inspired by Benefit’s origins as The Face Place and as a nod to the brand’s twin founders, its graphic shapes make up an endlessly adaptable set of cheeks, eyes, brows, and lips to configure a face.<br /><br />We honed the brand’s voice, so Benefit could more confidently own its expertise and quirky sense of humour. Together we defined the verbal identity as the Fun-Loving Beauty Genius who talks to people like they’ve known them for ages, enthusiastically shares their knowledge, and keeps things playful.

                                            <p><strong>Opinion</strong><br />
                                            The old logo was fine in terms of its design, typeset in a Didone serif with some flair in the “fi” ligature that italicized only the “f” but it felt like an antiquated fashion/cosmetics brand aimed at a much older audience that peaked in the 1980s. The only thing keeping it youthful was the pink color. Moving away from the more traditional high contrast of the Didone thick-and-thin construction, the new logo achieves a younger and more sprightly look while also improving on its execution with tighter spacing, better readability, a more unified “fi” ligature, and slightly more dramatic ball terminals. Now more often rendered in reds, purples, and black, the logo manages to infuse some subtle edginess to the otherwise book-ish nature of the serif typography.<span></span> The new visual language is fun and energetic if perhaps a little hard to follow in terms of what is or what isn't on brand… like, there is A LOT of new typefaces in play, a lot of graphics, a lot of colors, a lot of 3D things, a lot of packaging that could be new or old… which I guess is more a concern for me than it is for the end consumer as the resulting visual language has that frenetic TikTok energy young people thrive off of these days where the more, the faster, the more colorful the better. The case study applications and visual language specimens aren't the most helpful either, making it hard to grasp what goes where and with what purpose. Either that or I'm just getting old.<span></span> Personal confusion aside there ARE a couple of nice things I can appreciate, like the introduction of the faces in a <a href="https://www.google.com/search?sca_esv=dc34c69bf0bcbd51&amp;sxsrf=AHTn8zo2IkRyxWm_JUiulrCd_JdRs6oPeg:1742380845789&amp;q=it%27s+a+small+world+after+all+facade&amp;udm=2&amp;fbs=ABzOT_CWdhQLP1FcmU5B0fn3xuWpA-dk4wpBWOGsoR7DG5zJBkzPWUS0OtApxR2914vrjk7XZXfnfKsaRZouQANLhmphhQ59o5iCukHYTTDln07_4jqRXhrdPAC7YkPEyAks9G-P9EtPXmU1JIRzSiPQt4QU7UrNXQpT3ZfOKRQucLb5p7br1mj-sTLam-yEzUpDuF4sOzsSrb-GxDqgMMeeIhiOTI6hXw&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwivwIG7-pWMAxWPM9AFHfvmBHkQtKgLegQIDhAB&amp;biw=1527&amp;bih=1020&amp;dpr=2" target="_blank"><em>It's a Small World</em>-esque</a> aesthetic that can be configured in different ways using a fun set of abstract shapes for the cheeks and lips. Extracting only the eyes from that system is also kind of cool, especially given the brand's strong association with all things brows. The shopping bags — the most straightforward application seen here — look pretty great. Overall this has a very appropriate youthful exuberance  with a subtle hint of playful luxury.</p>

                                            <p>Opened in 1914, the <a href="https://www.rom.on.ca/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Royal Ontario Museum</a> (ROM) is Canada’s largest and most comprehensive museum. It houses 18 million artworks, cultural objects and natural history specimens, featured in 40 gallery and exhibition spaces. Last year, with the intention of attracting new and younger visitors, ROM introduced a new logo and identity designed by <a href="https://leoburnettdesign.ca/Home-Set" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Leo Design</a>, of Leo Burnett&#8217;s Toronto office. This identity replaces one created in 2013 and reviewed <a href="https://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/rom_goes_portal_on_its_logo.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a> on Brand New.</p>

<span id="more-304467"></span>

<p><em>Ed.&#8217;s Note: The logo isn&#8217;t new-new, it was introduced internally through corporate materials in 2023 and began showing up online as early as Summer of 2023, so this isn&#8217;t “news” but the full brand rollout took place in 2024 and I don&#8217;t recall seeing this project covered anywhere else so I figured I might break my own <strong><em>timeline</em></strong> rules. (That emphasis will make sense once you read this post.) ALSO! Please welcome new guest writer, Josh Berta. — Armin</em></p>

<blockquote>
As a central focus of this new identity, ROM&#8217;s new wordmark needed to feel bold and contemporary, while also possessing a timeless longevity. Designed as a perfect square, it adapts flawlessly across hundreds of applications of any size &#8211; from large building signage to tiny insect labels &#8211; and seamlessly within vertical or horizontal constraints.
All while visually echoing the stitches that make up the moments in our immortal timeline.

<p>The old logo featured a monogram that functioned as a window or portal onto imagery of artifacts, locked up with the full name of the institution. Even at the time, the logo-as-window conceit felt a little overdone, and was not particularly successful, with the imagery usually looking awkwardly clipped. And while it was slightly more grown up than its predecessor, it still felt a bit too much like a children&#8217;s museum than an incredibly important cultural institution.</p>

<p>The new logo, now just a wordmark formatted into a square proportion, is built with a new custom typeface called ROM Coign, designed by <a href="https://www.colophon-foundry.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Colophon</a>. I am, admittedly, a total sucker for a condensed sans serif, and this one — shown in detail further down below — is impeccably designed, as we&#8217;ve come to expect from Colophon. The letterforms are not groundbreaking in their design but the super condensed-ness is what provides its distinctive character. Generally speaking I love this logo, and feel that it elevates the museum&#8217;s identity to a more sophisticated and respectable place befitting its importance and legacy.</p>

<blockquote>
While Royal Ontario Museum (ROM) is the largest and most iconic art institution in Canada, its scale of over 13 million artifacts is simply not enough anymore to appeal to a more diverse and younger audience. We were tasked to help jolt and overhaul every touchpoint of this incredible museum.
<br /><br />
The new rebranded ROM will transform lives by helping people understand the past, so that they can make sense of the present and in turn come together to shape a shared future.
<br /><br />
The system employs a prominent use of an immortal timeline, one that plots every artifact, bone, beast, butterfly, painting.

ROM Coign is a custom typeface designed by Colophon Foundry for the Royal Ontario Museum. With seven weights alongside four different widths, all super condensed&#8230; [and] designed to expand and contract, it can create the sensation of diving into the single moments of our collective history, and then pulling back to reveal its immense scope. Every character representing a single stitch in time, all knit together in one immortal timeline.

<p>The full ROM Coign type family is comprised of seven weights and four widths, and the thinnest of them is crazy condensed to the point of virtual unreadability. Along with this type family, comes a huge library of newly and beautifully shot photography of the museum&#8217;s artifacts. As a side note, I find it odd that these photos are highly focused on natural and cultural artifacts, seemingly eschewing the museum&#8217;s art collection. I suppose that&#8217;s because a photo of art is just the art, where the artifacts can be captured in more evocative ways. Still, if you only saw this case study, I&#8217;d forgive you for not knowing ROM also has a huge art collection.</p>

<p>So there it is. The type and photos are effectively the whole of the new identity. There are no colors besides black and white, no graphic devices or patterns. If you look closely at the applications below you&#8217;ll see supporting typefaces Monument Grotesk from <a href="https://abcdinamo.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dinamo</a> and Arnhem from <a href="https://www.typeby.com/#Rm9udENvbGxlY3Rpb246Mzg3NjI2MjQ0OTk0MjM5Mjkx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Type By Smeijers</a>, but they are not highlighted in Leo Design&#8217;s case study.</p>

<p>Overall, it is an incredibly sparse toolkit, and its central expression is referred to as the &#8220;immortal timeline,&#8221; a continuous string of highly condensed type listing artifacts chronologically. Breaking up this essentially illegible string of text are images of artifacts, and the occasional keywords typeset in one of the wider widths of the type family. While this has a sort of dynamic and arresting quality, I am not particularly convinced by the concept of it. It feels more like the kind of rationalization shared during a pitch, especially when shown expanding and contracting to make certain phrases legible. But as an actual explanation of a system that needs to work across a wide array of applications, it offers little real functionality. While I personally find the super condensed text very fun the illegibility of it feels like a barrier to understanding and learning, counter to the institution&#8217;s mission. Additionally, I am disappointed by how often the most condensed typography looks like UPC barcodes, which has the unintended effect of conveying a commodification of these historic and beautiful objects.</p>

The new visual identity of the Royal Ontario Museum (ROM) captures the history of our planet. 13 million moments in time &#8211; bones, beasts, butterflies, portraits, sculptures, textiles, and more &#8211; from the past 4.2 billion years. Each object, artifact, and piece of art is like a single stitch along the vast timeline of our shared history.

<p>In use, there&#8217;s no huge surprises here. Despite the muddled concept, the system&#8217;s simplicity does a reasonably good job of serving the brand&#8217;s needs across the varied applications, especially when the text is at a more legible width. And even when it&#8217;s not so legible, it does have a certain unexpected, daring quality that commands attention. Indeed, when divorced from the barrage of the immortal timeline, single words and short phrases can be deciphered, and in that way the concept might redeem itself somewhat as it invites readers to be curious and look closer.</p>

<p>As a bonus, below is a pretty wild video created for the brand launch by agency partner <a href="https://www.brokenheartloveaffair.com/?r=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Broken Heart Love Affair</a> (BHLA), which is now on display at the museum. This is a bold, often political piece, that serves to convey the mission and ethos of the institution. It is odd, though, how little it actually employs the new identity, relegating it to the end titles. And I don&#8217;t get why everything is happening underwater, but sure, go for it.</p>

<p class="end">Maybe it&#8217;s just my deep and abiding affection for bold, condensed sans serifs, but despite all my objections to the rather abstruse concept of the immortal timeline, I can&#8217;t help but appreciate this identity. It has a certain confidence and clarity that feels right for an institution this significant. Its extreme simplicity, focused on bold, declarative messaging and stunning imagery, ultimately work better as a portal into the museum&#8217;s collections than the previous logo ever could. Does this rebrand accomplish the goal of appealing to younger audiences? I&#8217;m not sure. But overall, I do feel it allows the brand to say and show things clearly and authoritatively, and with just enough playfulness and mystery to draw visitors in.</p>

                                            <p>Last week, the popular headwear company, New Era, released a Major League Baseball cap collection nicknamed “Overlap” because it overlaps each team&#8217;s monogram on top of the team&#8217;s full wordmark. A good idea on paper perhaps but once applied systematically, some results were… not ideal. The most egregious overlap was for the Texas Rangers that when the monogram “T” was placed directly in the center and middle on top of the full name, it spelled out “TETAS”, which means “tits” in Spanish. The caps were pulled off the market but <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/405658856583" target="_blank" rel="noopener">eBay has some</a> if you really <em>wantit</em>.

                                            <p><strong>Relevant quote</strong><br /><em>In a health-obsessed market awash with gut puns and pastels, Hip Pop wanted to change the narrative, alleviate the pressure, and make pop fun again. With the category so focused on functional benefits, the brand needed to connect on an emotional level, by being a true solution, not another problem. A little treat without the weight that comes with being ‘bad’ or ‘good’.<br /><br />[The] brand strapline ‘Get real’ was born to encapsulate Hip Pop’s refreshing attitude. ‘Get real’ is a wake up call, a mindset, a way of life. It heroes not only the real ingredients that go into all Hip Pop’s drinks, but also celebrates real, live, unscripted experiences – while indirectly calling out the ‘fakeness’ of their mainstream competitors.<br /><br />Hip Pop’s previous look and feel was full of personality. But their characterful illustrations were more akin to craft beer, and the lack of colour variation across the products was confusing consumers. To have an instant impact on shelf, the drinks had to look tasty. So the visual identity needed to bring the ingredients to the forefront and celebrate flavour. All while making the brand name more prominent.<br /><br />Taking the ‘scoby’-shaped ‘O’ from the previous logo and amplifying it, the new wordmark is bolder, more impactful, and a subtle nod to the gut-friendly nature of the drinks. Now split across two lines on the packaging, ‘Hip Pop’ acts as a proud framing device for the contemporary fruit illustrations that feel almost alive – as if they’re bursting straight out of the can.

                                            The old logo was pretty decent, establishing a fun relationship between the extended vowels in the name and the condensed consonants, which helped support the idea that the “O” was (loosely) shaped like <a href="https://www.google.com/search?sca_esv=3b736228b17ed96f&amp;sxsrf=AHTn8zrthSb3x3wi0oMpPfPdEQjnnkMnQw:1742290063810&amp;q=scoby&amp;udm=2&amp;fbs=ABzOT_CWdhQLP1FcmU5B0fn3xuWpA-dk4wpBWOGsoR7DG5zJBsxayPSIAqObp_AgjkUGqel3rTRMIJGV_ECIUB00mupujJbyw82c7vlYBaFJu3BmNKDO7Mp31PxFs57Q2t0TKpSMTWVLdQ4ppPc71SNQVQNWGKTSHX_iBu4iYtdE5r1k6CHQbGPyDer_B4n3yEwEO3U-3q3vDylwgAlCrilNzuCxvYy-0A&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwj7juWiqJOMAxWtlu4BHXnJAOMQtKgLegQIERAB&amp;biw=1592&amp;bih=1095&amp;dpr=2" target="_blank">a SCOBY blob</a>. The “I” could have been extended more or perhaps given a skewed treatment of some sort for a better balance but, still, good enough. The new logo maintains the slanted, wider “O” but standardizes the rest of the characters' widths, which is perhaps less “fun” than the old one but also a perfectly viable alternative to achieving the same effect of bringing attention to the “O”, this time by smooshing it between the “P”s. The changes are also highly beneficial in that the wordmark can be used in a single line or stacked, a version that has some very satisfying alignments across the two lines and the various “P”s.<span></span> Like the old logo, the old packaging was pretty decent, with each can featuring exuberant geometric illustrations in monotone color palettes and supporting typography that continued the condensed-extended interplay. Unfortunately, it all did become too much of too many things, resulting in overly busy cans with little hierarchy and skewing too young with the geometric illustrations. The new cans pack a punch, deploying the logo as large as it can go on the front of the can and embedding some excellent illustrations between the two lines. The bold, dynamic, and colorful compositions of the illustrations are a perfect complement and contrast to the dense logo and the various color combinations are fun and electric. The flavor of each can is now way smaller than the old cans but it's actually easier to find and read.<span></span> The few other applications shown also make bold first impressions with a geometric sans serif in all caps for the headlines supporting the packaging photos. The copywriting gets a little carried away with attitude and at times it feels like they are workshopping catchphrases rather than establishing some kind of formula in tone and grammatical construction. Overall, a strong evolution that makes the brand look less like a homespun, garage-brewed kombucha brand and more like a competitive mass consumer product.</p>

                                                                    <img src="https://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/wp/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/AdobeMAX2024_Feature.jpg" alt="New Identity for Adobe MAX 2024 by Play" />
                                
                                
                                
                                                                                
                                        
                                            
                                            <p>Inaugurated in 2003, the first version of what would become <a href="https://max.adobe.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Adobe MAX</a> was the Macromedia MAX Conference in Salt Lake City, UT. Prior to 2003, Macromedia had been hosting two separate annual conferences to cater to their general software users (UCON, since 1990) and web developers (DevCon, since 1999). MAX was their effort to combine these audiences with one big event, featuring support labs, networking, a judged competition, and a showcase of the latest Macromedia products.</p>

<p>Adobe acquired Macromedia in 2005. The Macromedia name has long since fizzled out, but they&#8217;ve kept MAX going in continuity as an annual conference, switching from in-person to online-only during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 and 2021, and switching to a hybrid in-person/digital affair ever since. While promoting the latest design software to users and developers has remained the core conceit, the conference has expanded over the years to include a speaker series, vendor halls, parties, and educational courses which have built up MAX into a landmark event in the digital art and design industry. Despite <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/11/1/23434305/adobe-pantone-subscription-announcement-photoshop-illustrator" target="_blank" rel="noopener">color licensing spats</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/18/24005996/adobe-figma-acquisition-abandoned-termination-fee" target="_blank" rel="noopener">botched acquisitions</a>, and <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2024/06/ftc-takes-action-against-adobe-executives-hiding-fees-preventing-consumers-easily-cancelling" target="_blank" rel="noopener">subscription pricing scandals</a> in recent years, Adobe products remain the industry standard and market leader in creativity software. And the annual Adobe MAX conference has played a vital role in keeping Adobe front-of-mind for generations of designers. MAX regularly attracts over 10,000 in-person attendees and 21 million virtual event views.</p>

<p>This past year, Adobe MAX took place in October at the Miami Beach Convention Center in Miami Beach, FL. The identity, event graphics, and campaign were designed by San Francisco, CA-based <a href="https://play.studio/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Play</a>.</p>

<p>If you ever wanted a core sample of the past twenty years of digital design trends, the MAX logos are a great place to get it. The first few years ― back in the Macromedia days ― digital photography was still such a novelty that desktop wallpapers with the logo over landscapes were being showcased as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20031002073112/http://www.macromedia.com/macromedia/conference/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">downloadable promos</a> in glorious SVGA 800 x 600 resolution, if you could spare the 97 KB of bandwidth to download them. Cut ahead to 2009 and landscapes made up of 3D text extrusions are all the rage. 2015 is a case study in the art of crowd-sourcing. 2017 is all-in on 3D printing. 2020 and 2021 bask in the richly composed digital sets of virtual and augmented reality. Not every trend makes it into the lineup, but if there was a major cultural movement happening in the world of graphic design, you might just see it reflected in the MAX logo.</p>

<p>And now, back up on the surface, in 2024:</p>

<blockquote>
Our creative journey led us on a fun dialogue between designer and Adobe AI.
<br><br>
We started small — crafting simple sketches and textures in Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop that we called &#8220;atoms.&#8221; We fed these atoms to Firefly, Adobe&#8217;s generative image-making tool. Firefly transformed our atoms into expansive new worlds that captured the essence of creative beginnings.
<br><br>
From there, we cut and pasted these AI-generated landscapes into human-crafted collages we dubbed &#8220;solar systems.&#8221; Using our own artistic instinct to guide us. 
<br><br>
Next, we engaged in a cosmic collaboration with Photoshop&#8217;s generative fill tool to merge these solar systems and expand them beyond their canvases into something greater. Giving birth to vast creative universes. Each endlessly surprising. Demonstrating how human imagination and digital innovation can dance together to create something extraordinarily unexpected.

<p>Artificial intelligence in the creative field is a thorny issue. But to Adobe&#8217;s credit, over the past few years they&#8217;ve been extremely careful to plot a course through these particular brambles. Adobe Firefly, their flagship AI-image generator, <a href="https://helpx.adobe.com/firefly/get-set-up/learn-the-basics/adobe-firefly-faq.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pulls its training data only from content that Adobe legally has the rights to use</a>, such as the Adobe Stock library. Which is sadly far from the standard practice when it comes to training AI models, with major companies like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/openai-and-google-ask-for-a-government-exemption-to-train-their-ai-models-on-copyrighted-material-212906990.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OpenAI and Google seeking government exemption from copyright laws in order to remain competitive</a> in the never-ending battle to feed every image on the internet into their diffusion models. Adobe is also a co-founding member of the Content Authenticity Initiative, and has played a major role in developing a new type of metadata called <a href="https://contentcredentials.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Content Credentials</a> specifically made to maintain authorship for images even after they&#8217;ve been chewed up and spit out of an AI algorithm.</p>

<p>No images are being scraped or stolen to train the Adobe MAX 2024 identity model. The generative AI on display here is much more akin to a Content-Aware Fill than a Dall-E, filling in the blank spaces between human-made content.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s a strong philosophical metaphor made manifest in the process as outlined above. The key graphics are shaded with an ephemeral, airy quality. Contours veer off in unexpected directions. There&#8217;s an overall uncanny quality, artistic decisions that look like decisions that you&#8217;ve seen made before, but in configurations mashed together too densely and too haphazardly to have had actual intention behind them. It all looks distinctly like AI. And it takes a lot of justification to the audience to avoid hitting the familiar pain-points that come with those associations. I&#8217;m not sure it totally succeeds. This AI didn&#8217;t steal anything. But it looks an awful lot like the ones that do.</p>

<p>If you can manage to stomach the core graphical style, mercifully, the rest of the identity is full of human touches. Starting with the color balance. The patchwork system of atoms/worlds/solar systems/etc. allows for a pleasing distribution of core hues by an artist with an eye for composition. The universe of this conference identity is intelligently designed to prevent colors from skewing out of balance or oozing into muddy gradients. There&#8217;s a pleasing randomness to the final images that isn&#8217;t really randomness at all, but a series of artistic choices.</p>

<blockquote>
The iconic Adobe lens laid the foundation for our MAX brand system. More than just a visual device, the lens is a portal that welcomes creators of all stripes into a world of endless possibilities. Its versatility let us frame content and artwork in countless ways. The lens sparked an exploration of the infinite ways creative journeys begin. Whether it’s the turning of a key or diving into a pool, these first steps in the creative process are different for everyone. When these individual starting points converge, they create something unexpected.

<p>Purely for contrast, nothing stands out better against soft, fuzzy, abstract AI like a straight line. The lens element is a rectangular box which can either give shape to the otherwise shapeless generated imagery or appear as a solid red rectangle to act as a platform for text and photography. It&#8217;s a very functional bounding box, and the unambiguous and straightforward order it imposes on the pure chaos of the imagery does balance everything quite well.</p>

<blockquote>
We used the Adobe lens as our creative compass, guiding every aspect of our motion design. We pushed it, spun it, multiplied it, and wrapped it in an array of images. Turning a simple shape into an infinitely adaptable visual tool we could employ across any platform — from social media to the stage. Giving Adobe the power to maintain a consistent brand presence that still always managed to astonish.

<p>In motion, the lens is pure intention. The frames are pushed, pulled, and rotated in a series of fast snaps. The AI can barely get a second of screen time, more of an accent than a feature in these layouts. It&#8217;s a necessary equalizing force, letting the information be heard over the noise of the imagery. Throughout the rest of the identity, this is the ratio: chaos in AI art, or order in pure geometry.</p>

<p>The venues themselves are marvelously vibrant and tremendous in scale. Room-scale wraps will never not be impressive. Each surface is divided equally between blocks of red lens and fields of bubbly shapes and colors, with one exception. On the staircase, the swirls of AI foam are allowed to spill out unimpeded, without even the suggestion of a lens. Conceptually, the steps themselves are likely meant to serve as a pseudo-lens, a physical pattern of straight lines to keep the imagery in check. But in an identity this conceptually rich, it&#8217;s tempting to look for symbolism in the choice to let the algorithm run wild, up and down, ascending and descending, depending on your perspective.</p>

<p>Love, hate, or fear it &#8211; AI is the major cultural movement of our time and Adobe seems intent to show that AI doesn&#8217;t have to be a tool of theft and denigration, that in the right hands it can be used to create genuinely new things.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s easy to forget now, in 2025, with over two decades of growth and progress and refinement of the tools we take for granted every day, that digital art itself was at one time seen as the death of human artistry. But computers are still here, and so are we. In a landscape filled with entities and programs intent on replacing intention, the world that Play has produced in the 2024 Adobe MAX identity is almost utopian in its optimism.</p>

<p class="end">Here is envisioned a world in which AI is not an all-consuming, unstoppable force bent on removing humans from the practice of creativity. In this world, AI is tamed and contained and slotted neatly into the toolbox of the human artist, a soft brush to paint with. A reminder that technical innovation doesn&#8217;t necessarily have to be maxed out to be effective.</p>
