                                            <p><strong>Relevant quote</strong><br /><em>We wanted the visual language to reflect the essence of the school‚Äîbold yet refined, structured yet open, deeply rooted in craftsmanship yet forward-looking. This led us to create a system that feels both academic and experimental, where typographic precision meets expressive applications. The identity is designed to be a platform, a living system that adapts, evolves, and puts students and their work at the center. <br /><br />The ‚ÄòK‚Äô mark became a focal point because it embodies the school‚Äôs identity in its simplest, most iconic form. It‚Äôs a strong visual shorthand that instantly communicates the institution‚Äôs presence while offering versatility in application. <br /><br />The mark is designed to be more than just a logo; it‚Äôs a framing device, a spotlight, and a tool for storytelling. It highlights students, their work, their disciplines‚Äîplacing them at the center of the identity. It reflects the school‚Äôs role as a facilitator of creativity rather than just an institution. <br /><br />Additionally, the ‚ÄòK‚Äô serves as a modular system, adapting across different touchpoints while maintaining recognition. Whether used as a mark, a framing element, or a dynamic mask, it creates a consistent yet evolving expression of the school‚Äôs values. <br /><br />The idea of using textures and animations within the ‚ÄòK‚Äô is rooted in the concept of transparency and materiality. Kolding School of Design is a place where ideas take shape, where physicality and digital expression intersect. <br /><br />By treating the ‚ÄòK‚Äô as a mask, we create a window into the creative process. Whether it‚Äôs showcasing student work, highlighting different materials, or integrating movement through animation, the ‚ÄòK‚Äô becomes an active participant in the identity rather than a static symbol.

                                            <p><strong>Opinion</strong><br />
                                            The old logo had its appeal, with the extra bold ‚ÄúDK‚Äù mark that was big and thick enough to hold the name of the institution inside it. I'm not exactly sure what the starburst and star shape underneath it meant and were perhaps unnecessary although I do like the contrast the extra pointy starburst brought to the composition and would have worked better without the bottom shape. The new logo brings more focus to the location of the institution than its Design offering by adopting a standalone ‚ÄúK‚Äù monogram, which does become easier to apply and use in interesting ways than a larger ‚ÄúDK‚Äù solution in this style would have allowed. The monogram is pretty great, executed with the least amount of gestures needed to make the square read as a ‚ÄúK‚Äù. The wordmark, typeset in <a href="https://klim.co.nz/retail-fonts/soehne/" target="_blank">S√∂hne</a> in all uppercase and stacked across four lines is a slick complement and contrast to the bold ‚ÄúK‚Äù.<span></span> With a strong start in the logo, the identity feels a little too restrained, which in general is not a bad thing but as an identity for a design school in Denmark? That's like the most perfect and progressive context for some design horsepower but I can also understand that you can't just go wild for wild's sake and with the school trying to establish itself as a more serious and comprehensive higher-learning institution since achieving its university status it makes sense to go for something more buttoned up. Even then, there are a couple of cool moments like when the ‚ÄúK‚Äù is filled with video and placed on top of a lot of S√∂hne type or when S√∂hne is layered with the contrasting <a href="https://www.kometa.xyz/buy/victor-serif/" target="_blank">Victor Serif</a>. Where things could have been pushed or at least not done in such a straightforward way is with the backgrounds and textures added to the ‚ÄúK‚Äù, especially since it's such a big, bold canvas to play with. Overall, this strikes a modest balance of signaling the institution's commitment to both design and academia without leaning too heavily into the former and looking like another wacky art school your parents don't want to pay for.</p>

<h1 class="friday_likes">≈åpera de Domingo by Pl√°cida</h1>
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/friday_likes_operadomingo.jpg" alt="≈åpera de Domingo by Pl√°cida" />

<p style="margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;"><a href="https://operadedomingo.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">≈åpera de Domingo</a> is an interior design studio based in Granada, Spain, working with commercial, residential, corporate, and cultural clients to deliver a subtle, sophisticated touch to the diverse range of spaces. The identity, designed by local firm, <a href="https://placida.es/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pl√°cida</a>, is a lovely extension of the studio&#8217;s sensibility, introducing a minimalist and abstract rendition of their initials, ODD, constructed from the repetition of the same single shape. The core shape itself is not gratuitous either but inspired by <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=lattice+architecture&#038;sca_esv=fa927a4af76fe362&#038;udm=2&#038;biw=1810&#038;bih=1022&#038;sxsrf=AHTn8zq1xhZKCfj9w6mJnXW3FsjPU2HyQQ%3A1742549590693&#038;ei=VjLdZ_KFKvL8ptQPucONiQ4&#038;oq=lattice+architec&#038;gs_lp=EgNpbWciEGxhdHRpY2UgYXJjaGl0ZWMqAggAMgUQABiABDIEEAAYHjIEEAAYHjIEEAAYHjIGEAAYBRgeMgYQABgFGB4yBhAAGAUYHjIGEAAYBRgeMgYQABgFGB4yBhAAGAgYHkiPF1CjBljGD3ACeACQAQCYAWigAcMEqgEDNy4xuAEDyAEA-AEBmAIIoALfBJgDAIgGAZIHAzcuMaAHoS6yBwM3LjG4B98E&#038;sclient=img" target="_blank" rel="noopener">architectural lattice work</a> that uses repetitive shapes to create either functional or decorative (or both) building elements. I love the simplicity of the symbol and how effortlessly its decryption pays off when paired with the full name. Turning the shapes into a modular pattern that shifts orientations adds some restrained maximalism to an otherwise minimalist identity and the shapes also have the bonus of being able to reconfigure into smaller compositions to highlight the different specialties of the studio. Putting the finishing touch is a lovely color palette in warm grays and tan colors that echo some of the spaces they&#8217;ve designed, <a href="https://operadedomingo.com/proyecto/estudio-odd/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">including their very own office</a>. <span class="pagination_divider"></span><span class="small_caps"><a href="https://www.behance.net/gallery/221126581/Opera-de-Domingo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">See full project</a></span></p>

<h1 class="friday_likes">Suupaa by A Friend of Mine</h1>
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/friday_likes_suupaa.jpg" alt="Suupaa by A Friend of Mine" />

<p style="margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;"><a href="https://suupaa.au/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Suupaa</a> is a fast-casual Japanese restaurant and konbini (convenience store) in Melbourne, Australia that combines dine-in and takeaway food options along with a curated selection of life essentials. The identity, designed by local firm <a href="https://afom.com.au/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A Friend of Mine</a>, takes a stark, minimalist, black-and-white approach with a simple and bold wordmark as the logo but then slowly infuses the brand with humor and unexpected touches, chief among them the giant, geometric puffer fish that adorns the storefront which later transforms into a charming squiggly drawing on a cap. The headline typography uses Dinamo&#8217;s <a href="https://abcdinamo.com/typefaces/synt" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Synt</a> in its ‚ÄúTurbo‚Äù style, which is like an italicized italic that provides a very peculiar design visual language, especially when paired with <a href="https://fontsinuse.com/typefaces/230206/quadrant-text" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Quadrant</a> and <a href="https://www.grillitype.com/typeface/gt-alpina" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GT Alpina Typewriter</a> for a serif on serif <em>on</em> serif typographic palette. The identity extends beautifully from digital signage to takeaway food and beverage packaging to ‚Äî my favorite ‚Äî shopping basket. <span class="pagination_divider"></span><span class="small_caps"><a href="https://afom.com.au/projects/suupaa/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">See full project</a></span>

<h1 class="friday_likes">Santa Marta by Blavet Studio</h1>
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/friday_likes_santamarta.jpg" alt="Santa Marta by Blavet Studio" />

<p style="margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:30px!important;"><a href="https://www.instagram.com/santamarta.vlc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Santa Marta</a> is a food catering service in Valencia, Spain, that also operates a deli-style takeaway restaurant. The identity, designed by local firm <a href="https://blavetstudio.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Blavet Studio</a>, is not particularly unique or surprising in the sense that it adopts a relatively traditional script as its main design element but, somehow, it is just quite right and perfect for the elevated homemade cuisine the establishment is known for. The pairing with a thin, condensed serif typeset in all caps gives it just enough of a design-y edge to make this look more interesting than just antiquated or overly traditional. Adding another layer are some charming, realistic illustrations in pencil that bring some welcome texture to some of the applications. And, of course, everything is always better with a dash of gold foil. <span class="pagination_divider"></span><span class="small_caps"><a href="https://www.behance.net/gallery/220884949/Santa-Marta" target="_blank" rel="noopener">See full project</a></span></p>

It is a suburb in the Greater Boston metropolitan area, located directly across the Charles River from Boston. The city&#8217;s population as of the 2020 U.S. census was 118,403, making it the most populous city in the county, the fourth-largest in Massachusetts behind Boston, Worcester, and Springfield, and ninth-most populous in New England.The city was named in honor of the University of Cambridge in Cambridge, England, which was an important center of the Puritan theology that was embraced by the town&#8217;s founders. Harvard University, an Ivy League university founded in Cambridge in 1636, is the oldest institution of higher learning in the United States. The Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), Lesley University, and Hult International Business School also are based in Cambridge.&#8221; (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambridge,_Massachusetts" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wikipedia</a>)</p>

Consistent support was also needed for editorial design, campaign branding, digital platforms and community engagement.<br /><br />Nimblebot created an adaptable branding system for the city featuring a vibrant logo, updated typography and versatile color palette. A custom illustration library captured Cambridge‚Äôs neighborhoods, landmarks and people, while campaign branding for key initiatives ensured cohesive messaging. The website was redesigned for accessibility and branded merchandise, while explainer videos and templates ensured consistent, engaging communications.

                                            <p><strong>Opinion</strong><br />
                                            Like many other cities, Cambridge was using its official seal as its logo, which never goes well because these are old, heavily detailed insignias that were not designed for use in, say, brochures, on the side of trash cans, or as social media avatars. With this new approach, Cambridge now has a range of expressions ‚Äî¬†all designed around <a href="https://www.google.com/search?sca_esv=9c61c6d612e03081&amp;sxsrf=AHTn8zouDkUFd3PA_v7CSAmOs0UhjHzB7A:1742463147410&amp;q=cambridge+ma+city+hall&amp;udm=2&amp;fbs=ABzOT_CWdhQLP1FcmU5B0fn3xuWpA-dk4wpBWOGsoR7DG5zJBjnSuuKZNj-6zieDk_gkn6AKnSLKCogWmTELYC4Vpj6gI_yugD_H7vRrmd5-PexDEYOnFMG43ueJWetUiYk-IKPeO04KGBqpf0LigzkWiYe6pulCT28CkA6jTVPTpqvY46ZrN7QB6unGk4UpG2SRT2JpIefV4AxJ-tWDBxQaCgMT2qNYgQ&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwi-3r2HrZiMAxXzlYkEHXurHCgQtKgLegQIEBAB&amp;biw=1810&amp;bih=1022&amp;dpr=2" target="_blank">its landmark city hall building</a> ‚Äî that can be used for different purposes and in varying contexts, ranging from the official seal, which remains in play, to a lovingly detailed reduction of it still formatted as a seal, to a crisp minimalist interpretation for the most flexible and wide use. While icons based off of buildings are rarely that interesting, there is something particularly nice about this one‚Ä¶ the proportions, the slanted roofs, the amount of windows, the subtle detailing on the tower‚Ä¶ it's just very pleasing and so well executed.<span></span> Accompanying the icon is a bold, sturdy wordmark typeset in the city's new proprietary typeface designed in collaboration with <a href="http://www.bastardatype.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bastarda</a> that takes some cues from city hall's facade to create a surprisingly original condensed sans serif. Not saying ‚Äúsurprisingly original‚Äù as in I wasn't expecting this from either Nimblebot or Bastarda but as in it's actually super hard in this day and age to find new ways to cut a sans serif and the curved tapers in some of the letters like the ‚ÄúA‚Äù, ‚ÄúV‚Äù, and ‚ÄúY‚Äù are such a nice detail that gives this typeface quite a bit of personality. It looks great in all caps in the wordmark but then it functions beautifully in any application in any kind of typesetting, from magazine masthead to sub-brand treatment.<span></span> The applications are as slick as it gets for a city government and I would be damn proud if my city had such crisp-looking brochures or social media posts, all deployed through a relatively simple yet robust layout system that keeps building on the city hall homage, with generous arches serving as holding shapes for text, color, and imagery. The illustrations are pretty nice too, with plenty of detail but abstract enough where they can easily be re-colorized into some funky combinations that add some extra flair to the applications. Overall, this is probably one of the best city government identities I've seen in some time, infusing all of its communications with an enjoyable vibrancy while still managing to look official and like the entity in charge of things running smoothly and lawfully.</p>

The Brewery is built on the same foundation as their farm-made sausages, bacon, and black pudding. It is a mission to <a href="https://www.thewfj.co.uk/p/the-grain-to-glass-philosophy-of" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&#8220;reconnect local people with local produce.&#8221;</a> To that end, Somer Valley grows their own barley to make malt‚Äîa rarity among brewers. First poured in 2023, Somer Valley Brewing flagships Session Pale Ale &#8220;Rolling Hills&#8221; and Helles Lager &#8220;Brook&#8221; are both celebrated <a href="https://somervalleyfarms.com/blog/harvesting-excellence-totwawards" target="_blank" rel="noopener">award winners</a>. Recently, to better their story, Somer Valley  introduced a new identity designed in collaboration by Bath, England-based <a href="https://supplestudio.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Supple Studio</a> and London, UK-based <a href="https://www.studiospilsbury.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Studio Spilsbury</a>.</p><span id="more-304843"></span>

<blockquote>
Somer Valley aren‚Äôt your usual craft brewers ‚Äì they grow their own barley on their farm using rotational cropping techniques alongside their happy herd of heritage cows. Which means the soil they grow in is tip top and teaming with goodness. Once harvested, the barley whizzes down the A36 a few miles to be traditionally floor malted in Warminster. So the beer miles are as low as possible and the barley doesn‚Äôt get fresher. They‚Äôve even dug a bore hole for their own water source ‚Äì so ingredients don&#8217;t get more local than this. 
<br /><br />
We were asked to evolve their logo and create a visual language for the brewery that puts their farming story front and centre.

<p>The old identity had the right idea to render the brand&#8217;s namesake valley, however the designs themselves individually felt too generic. Starting with the logo, the center frame of the valley is rendered in a geometric style that feels ordinary‚Äîit could be from anywhere. The surrounding text wrapped the logo with a geometric sans serif. While there is nothing offensive about it, there is also nothing memorable. I feel the same way about the can designs which used subtle wave and hill patterns to create a color block for the name to sit, centered and safe. Across these elements was a strong sense of geometric shapes and hard grids. Together, they moved the identity into a the land of forgettable vector artwork.</p>

<p>The new logo maintains the overall shape and visual quality from the prior work, which will certainly ease the transition for a small scale operation. Yet, it pushes the valley into an abstracted representation. I like this move because the former felt trite. It is easy enough to suggest the sun and fields without the obligatory literal rendering. The surrounding name is now set in <a href="https://www.inhousetype.com/typefaces/p/aesthet-nova" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Aesthet Nova</a> which also feels more organic and natural. The new logo is a win, not just visually but also as a better rendering of their story: a family affair getting back to its roots.</p>

<p>I do have one small nitpick for the one-color logo. I do not like how some of the patterns fill the arc shapes. The dot patterns are too formulaic, and the dots hit the container walls at some weird places. I wish those patterns were a bit more sporadic, which would have avoided that issue.</p>

<p>OK, I&#8217;ll say it. This feels like a ridiculous amount of colors. While I appreciate the nature-themed sentiment, I want the colors in a branding project to feel useable. Separating the primary brand colors from secondary would help us better make sense of this 24-hue set.</p>

<p>I can say, thankfully, most of these colors are not apart of the applications you will see below.</p>

<blockquote>
Working with our friend and collaborator Simon Spilsbury we created a suite of textures by printing, rubbing and inking everything from hay bales to tractor wheels. Spilsbury then created farm-based illustrations that bring the patterns to life with wit and charm. </blockquote>

<p>The textures are delicious. I love that the team went to the farm to directly capture them. A clear step to move the identity away from vector-based graphics that addresses the design brief. Additionally, who doesn&#8217;t want to drive a tractor across craft paper. These are fantastic.</p>

<p>To put the textures to use they are paired with equally delightful illustrations. From farmers to cows, dogs to boots, each is filled with personality. The hand written expressions add humor and charm. Top down, they provide the necessary impact a crafter brewery requires.</p>

<p>As the elements combine there is a quirky charm that comes to the surface, particularly between the textures and illustrations. But the colors, type, and copy writing all come into play as well. They work because they each feel purposeful. For another project, it might come across as gimmicky, yet here it feels well suited.</p>

<p>At first I was surprised by the cans, assuming that these would fall to beer can design conventions: bold colors and strong typography. These are not that. But, I dig them. The hierarchy, organization and overall design are thoughtful and sensitive. I appreciate the move to the 1-color logo (for the face side); a move clearly to prevent visual conflict. The names and back side messaging maintain the farm-life personality.</p>

<p>The glassware is probably my least favorite design. The illustrations lose some of the earlier restraint, and the glasses feel a bit too messy. I favor the instances when a single illustration can hold prominence.</p>

<p>The shirts are fun. And it is easy to imagine all the ways that these designs could expand. At some point the need for more illustrations may become a factor, but for now they are plentiful and perfect.</p>

<p class="end">Launching a brewing operation in 2023 is a bold move. In the face of a <a href="https://beernouveau.co.uk/2023-brewery-closures/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mess of closers</a>, Somer Valley figured something out; all the while working with an identity that did not fully express their values. However it is a new season, and they have a new identity. It isn&#8217;t bold, and it might not visually command the store shelf. Yet for those that it connects with, it will likely endear itself to them. The charming illustrations and clever copy are really well executed. The resulting identity speaks to their commitment of quality &#8220;from our land, to your hand.&#8221; A task that is easy to do poorly, but difficult to feel authentic. For me, they delivered with the strength of a farmer&#8217;s handshake.</p>
