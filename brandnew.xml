It is produced globally by Nestlé (which acquired Rowntree&#8217;s in 1988), except in the United States, where it is made under licence by the H. B. Reese Candy Company, a division of the Hershey Company (an agreement Rowntree&#8217;s first made with Hershey in 1970). The standard bars consist of two or four pieces composed of three layers of wafer, separated and covered by an outer layer of chocolate. Each finger can be snapped from the bar separately. There are many flavours of Kit Kat, including milk, white, and dark chocolate.&#8221; (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kit_Kat" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wikipedia</a>)</p>

                                            <p><strong>Opinion</strong><br />
                                            (Note: This design only applies to Kit Kat in the U.S.). The old logo was pretty good for a mainstream candy bar… it had a solid typographic foundation, some decent shadowing, and it had stayed true to <a href="https://1000logos.net/kit-kat-logo/" target="_blank">its long-standing design</a> of the large “K”s with “it” and “at” nestled within. Like many mainstream consumer goods, it adopted a swoosh at some point, which was the main and only drawback of the old logo as it clashed in style, construction, and shadowing with the type. The new logo sticks to the same winning formula but manages to add some retro flair that makes this new logo look like a resurrection from some old logo in the brand's archives and executed for a new audience. However, that's not the case and this is actually a relatively drastic departure from anything that has come before it.<span></span> The biggest changes being exchanging the double-storey “a” for a single-storey and removing the curl of the “t”, two gestures that have been there forever. The move allows for the letters to be nestled in even tighter and closer, which then allows for the new drop shadow to encase all of the letters without any breaks. The swoosh has also been removed in favor of a simple, tilted, oval stroke in white that matches the thickness of the thinner part of the drop shadow. It now looks more classic than it has in the past. <span></span> The packaging evolution for the core product is not as drastic, simply replacing the old logo for the new one but there is a clever new system for other flavors — and, boy, does Kit Kat like to introduce flavors — that employs four monochromatic bars to hint at the flavor profile (e.g., pinks for pink lemonade and mints for mint). I say it's clever because the four stripes echo the four bars that make up a classic Kit Kat. The supporting graphics for the flavor variations are not the best but you can't win every battle in mainstream packaging. A couple of additional applications hint at other uses of the four stripes and there is some odd combination of typography but given the small sample set, we won't get into it. Overall, it's a solid evolution that maintains everything that is recognizable about the brand and builds on the growing appreciation of nostalgia as it adopts a design reminiscent of simpler, more innocent times.</p>

                                            <p>Established in 2006, <a href="https://www.crunchyroll.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Crunchyroll</a> is an American entertainment company that champions the art and culture of Anime through a subscription video on-demand service, events that bring its community together, theatrical distribution of international titles, and sale of manga titles and collectibles and merchandise. Founded by a group of University of California, Berkeley, graduates, the company was initially a pirate site but slowly acquired titles legally through proper licensing. Going through a couple of owners, it was acquired by Sony Pictures Television in 2020, which had acquired another similar company in 2017 — Funimation, founded by Gen Fukunaga — and merging the two under the Crunchyroll name. Today, Crunchyroll is an independently operated joint venture between U.S.-based Sony Pictures Entertainment and Japan’s Aniplex, a subsidiary of Sony Music Entertainment (Japan) Inc., both subsidiaries of Tokyo-based Sony Group Corporation and, as of last week, its streaming service, which offers offers 50,000 episodes and more than 25,000 hours of anime series, music, and movies, has officially crossed 15 million monthly paying subscribers. At Comic-Con last month, Crunchyroll introduced a new identity designed in-house.</p>

<blockquote>The new look, feel, and sound of Crunchyroll reflects the joy that anime brings fans worldwide and is focused on an ethos of fun and celebration. Development of the new brand identity package was led by Crunchyroll’s Markus Gerdemann (Senior Vice President, Marketing) and Norman Rabinovich (Vice President, Creative Services), and includes:
<br /><br />
<strong>Logo</strong><br />
The updated logo, featuring a more balanced eye symbol and a revamped wordmark, modernizes the brand and enhances approachability and boldness.
<br /><br />
<strong>Typography</strong><br />
The new font set, Crunchyroll Atyp, blends classic and modern elements, improving readability and supporting diverse characters for Crunchyroll’s global audience.´
<br /><br />
<strong>Color System</strong><br />
Vibrant orange symbolizes passion and energy, complemented by black, white, and taupe for versatility and sophistication, reflecting anime&#8217;s dynamic nature.
<br /><br />
<strong>Glyph System</strong><br />
With over 139 glyphs inspired by anime and manga, the new glyphs add depth and personality, enhancing communication and connection with fans.
<br /><br />
<strong>Mnemonic / Sonic Design</strong><br />
The new seven-second audio-visual mnemonic captures the immersive experience of Crunchyroll, combining anime-inspired sound design with playful and engaging elements, reinforcing the brand&#8217;s joyful and mischievous spirit.
<br /><br />
<strong>Illustration and Patterns</strong><br />
Collaborating with Japanese artists, new textures and patterns reflect anime storytelling&#8217;s depth and complexity, creating an authentic and immersive brand experience.</blockquote><h3>Crunchyroll provided text</h3>

<p>Don&#8217;t quote me on this but based on what I was able to find online, the name of the company refers to, literally, a crunchy roll, an American sushi delicacy and <a href="https://logos.fandom.com/wiki/Crunchyroll" target="_blank" rel="noopener">its original logo</a> was pretty much a graphic depiction of said roll. In 2012, maintaining the overall construction of the original, the icon seems to have shifted to what I interpret to be an eye, which are such a significant element of anime but I really have no idea of that is its intention. In any case, the icon evolution is fine although I am not sure if entirely beneficial as the wider spacing between the crescent shape and the circle inside in the old logo provided a better contrast at small sizes. The wordmark, to me, is an instant improvement simply by moving away from the old spurless sans that had such a wonky rhythm. The bolder, geometric sans serif isn&#8217;t particularly exciting nor evocative of anime in any way. It also makes the long name even longer but, technically, again, it&#8217;s fine.</p>

<p>To the wordmark&#8217;s credit, I think it&#8217;s easy to see — as you begin to scroll through the project — why it&#8217;s so “generic”, which is not to say it&#8217;s bad but it&#8217;s just not special, allowing the identity elements to be the actual special sauce. In the same vein as the wordmark, the typeface choice for the identity, <a href="https://www.myfonts.com/collections/atyp-font-suitcase-type-foundry?refby=ucllc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Atyp</a>, isn&#8217;t a breakout star but it does provide a neutral and unassuming typographic foundation on which to add the custom glyphs, which are loads of fun and set up a precedent for an endless library of glyphs to be created in years to come, expanding the playfulness of the identity. The simplicity of the typeface allows for the glyphs to stand out but its sturdiness also means the glyphs don&#8217;t eclipse it altogether and its neutrality means that all the glyphs can easily stand in for any of the letters in the messaging.</p>

<figcaption>Manga textures and illustrations.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Another great element is the library of single-color, manga-inspired patterns and illustrations that can be used in black on top of the limited color palette of orange and tan, which works beautifully to yield a kind of frugal presence where it would have been easy and tempting to drench this in color but since the content itself is so colorful, establishing this minimal color palette helps establish a strong Crunchyroll brand. Same as the glyphs, these patterns and illustrations can expand over the years to keep the identity fresh and I imagine both could also be used for collaborations with specific titles, blending glyphs and/or images related to an anime property into the Crunchyroll system.</p>

<p>The applications are bold and energetic. I&#8217;m not sure if glyphs on top of patterns is too much and both elements compete for attention but the effusiveness of the style is certainly there. One small detail that I&#8217;m really digging is the use of thick borders on just two sides of the layout (like in the third from top advertising image above) or the treatment where there are some comic-strip-like double-lines as if the layouts were zoomed in on multiple panels.</p>

<p class="end">In motion, the identity gets even more engaging and exciting with subtle infusions of anime style gestures applied to their own elements — I can&#8217;t get enough of anytime a little cloud goes puff and the animated patterns are pretty awesome. Overall, aside from the ho-hum logo evolution, this packs a punch that should help Crunchyroll establish its own brand but have it be clearly linked to manga and anime by speaking the same visual language but with their own spin. I should also acknowledge that I do not know the first thing about anime or manga so all of the above is perhaps some sort of offense to those cultures in its reductiveness so my enthusiasm for it might be due to my general ignorance about it, which is perhaps a positive signal that this identity could also help attract manga and anime beginners.</p>

Today, <a href="https://www.mcgrath.com.au/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">McGrath Estate Agents</a> stands tall as one of Australia&#8217;s leading residential real estate groups.&#8221; McGrath has 141 offices; 34,000 properties under management; and sold 13,000 properties in FY 2023 for a total value of $9.3 billion.</p>

                                            <p><strong>Relevant quote</strong><br /><em>As we gathered insights from agents, management, and customers, one silent quality stood out: McGrath’s exceptional ethos of customer care. This is particularly significant for customers who navigate highly stressful life changes. Good results must be matched by a positive experience, including trust and guidance from someone who understands their unique situation. This quality was inherently part of the DNA but not represented to date. The brand refresh shifts the brand from an experienced, responsible property agent to a warm, wise property guide.<br /><br />The design of the identity shifts the tone from being impressive to being inspiring. It balances the warm and human side with a smart and confident one. The property photography evokes the feel of lived moments, with brand photography celebrating customers and the warmth of real homes. The strapline “Guiding you home” emphasizes long-term, client-centric relationships.<br /><br />The visual Identity maintains continuity while pushing into a clear new brand direction. The McGrath orange evolved into a softer two-tone palette. And the typography now includes both serif and a cleaner sans serif font, creating an interplay of sharpness and human traits. The new logo enhances clarity and strength, building on the previous logo that had been in use for over 25 years.

                                            <p><strong>Opinion</strong><br />
                                            The old logo was… a choice. Someone went way out of their way to choose an unnecessarily light weight for the “c”, which made it look like a weird error and, at smaller sizes, the logo ended up reading like “M. Grath”. The new logo is… normal. Now in an elegant and simple sans serif, which appears to take elements from each of <a href="https://www.sharptype.co/typefaces/centra-no-1" target="_blank">Centra No.1</a> (the “t”) and <a href="https://www.sharptype.co/typefaces/centra-no-2" target="_blank">Centra No.2</a> (the “M”) to yield Centra No.1.5. There is something really pleasant about the combination of letters in this name, in this style: wide uppercase letters, circular letters, a few angles in there, and an ascender at the end for a nice balance.<span></span> The highlight of the identity for me is the color palette of orange, light brown, and dark purple. It's elegant but not stuffy and it's the furthest away from any recent trend. Complementing Centra, which extends from the logo into the identity, is <a href="https://www.luzi-type.ch/recife" target="_blank">Recife Display</a> in its lighter weight, which adds a touch of luxury. The applications are all straightforward but very nicely executed with the few elements at play delivering just the right amount of design-y-ness and personality. Overall, an excellent evolution — especially given how “cold” the old identity felt — that maintains the upscale appearance but with a much warmer and welcoming presence.</p>

The region is associated with the pre-Incan Chachapoya people, also called &#8220;Warriors of the Clouds&#8221;, who lived there from 800 &#8211; 1740 C.E. and lend their name to the modern-day capital city of Chachapoyas. Ancient cities, cliff-side mausoleums, and vibrant living cities dot the countryside between natural hot springs, waterfalls, cloud forests, and wild orchids. In doing my background research on the Utcubamba Corridor, the pitch I keep coming across from travel guides and blogs is that it&#8217;s Machu Picchu without the crowds. The most direct point of comparison is the <a href="https://www.wmf.org/project/kuelap-fortress" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kuelap Fortress</a>, an ancient fortified citadel on the slopes of the Andes that draws in an estimated 200,000 tourists a year compared to Machu Picchu&#8217;s annual 1.5 million. Launched in September 2023 to promote tourism to the Utcubamba Corridor as <a href="https://aventuratechachapoyas.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Aventúrate Chachapoyas</a>, the new name, logo, and identity <a href="https://mundochachapoyas.pe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mundo Chachapoyas</a> was unveiled in June 2024 by Lima, Peru-based <a href="https://studioa.pe" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Studioa</a>.</p>

<p>The old logo wasn&#8217;t anything to write home about. Aventúrate Chachapoyas (literally &#8220;Adventure to Chachapoyas&#8221;) was rendered in bubble letters that were themselves encased in one big superbubble. If you&#8217;re looking to kill some time waiting for your flight, try to follow the logic of how the lines are incorporated here. &#8220;Aventúrate&#8221; in yellow gets a thin black outline while &#8220;Chachapoyas&#8221; in red is given thick white internal shine accents on the top right of each character, implying a light source that bends along the downward curve of the logo. Then the whole thing&#8230; vibrates? bounces? with overlines on the terminal letters of each word, bending uncomfortably into the negative space in the &#8220;AS&#8221; pair. Three lozenges, reminiscent of stonework found around the region but utterly disconnected from the style of the rest of the piece, float awkwardly beneath the lettering. I usually give some leniency to vacation destination branding that leans into the casual and friendly vibes because, for a lot of vacationers, the casual and friendly vibes are what they came for. But it&#8217;s a short trip down the hill from &#8220;casual and friendly&#8221; to &#8220;sloppy and amateurish&#8221;.</p>

<p>The new logo, Mundo Chachapoyas (literally &#8220;Chachapoyas World&#8221;) dials in on a more serious tone, starting with the change of name. It&#8217;s a subtle elevation &#8211; going from the setting of an adventure to a world unto itself. The lozenges return as prominent accents in the lettering by forming the crossbars in the “H”s and “A”s and flanking glyphs for &#8220;Mundo&#8221;. The new primary brand color, forest green, is sedate and earthy. The logos before and after evoke very different vacation experiences. I would go to Aventúrate Chachapoyas expecting a dodgy zipline. I would go to Mundo Chachapoyas expecting a history lesson.</p>

We created “Chachánika&#8221;, a typography that captures the essence of the Chachapoyas, giving a voice to the region, artisans, communities, and entrepreneurs. It expresses the uniqueness of this area by blending its ancestral heritage with natural wonders from a contemporary and conscious perspective, allowing us to convey the region&#8217;s cultural richness in every communication element.

<p>You can really feel the Peruvian stonework in Chachánika, Mundo Chachapoyas&#8217; custom typeface. Heavy bases, uneven stresses, and angular construction add up to a font that wouldn&#8217;t feel nearly as effective in another brand. It&#8217;s also a real treat to see detailed sketches behind the typographic quirks &#8211; the justifications are clear and specific, with angles coming from the faces of statuary, line quality coming from pottery detail, and lozenges being drawn from wall details. Real care and attention went into this typeface, and the result is a solid set of glyphs that start out stylistically impressive and only get more remarkable the closer you look.</p>

<p>Something about the illustrations isn&#8217;t clicking for me, and it might just be unfortunate timing. In the four years since <a href="https://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/new_logo_and_identity_for_robinhood_by_collins.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Robinhood lifted the Moebius style</a> of thin black outlines and vibrant solid colors composing scenes, the aesthetic has become a trend indelibly linked to tech and insurance companies. The spot illustrations do manage to find a fresh angle by composing their scenes into self-contained islands, but that doesn&#8217;t save the style from feeling tired and mismatched within the otherwise sober and traditional identity. Through no real fault of their own, these illustrations take me out of the Peruvian vacation headspace entirely.</p>

<blockquote>
Inspired by the natural and cultural surroundings of the Utcubamba Valley, where the Chachapoya culture thrived—known as the &#8220;people of the clouds&#8221; due to the dense Andean mist—we designed a graphic system based on textures of clouds, forests, earth, and water. This revealed hidden faces and infused the brand with mysticism, using a vibrant and dynamic color palette.

<figcaption>Pattern system.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The pattern system really is a thing of beauty. In an era dominated by brand asset generators and Perlin noise patterns, it&#8217;s both amazing and refreshing to see how effective a few tight crops on a handful of foggy face shapes can be.</p>

<p>This isn&#8217;t a brand critique, more a technique critique: I want to see this as a tiling pattern. It&#8217;s clearly not required to get good patterns out of the system, but A) the presence of edges needlessly limits where crops can occur, skewing selections in towards the center and producing more repeating shapes over time, and B) it would have been so easy to make this into a tiling pattern that it bugs me that they didn&#8217;t do it.</p>

<p>In these more straightforward layouts, I&#8217;m really digging the thematic contrast between the man-made inspirations for the typeface and the natural inspirations for the pattern. The type stands out against the gentle curves of the pattern like ruins in the mist, and those full-bleed greens and accent colors are so rich. It&#8217;s a tasty combo and a strong cornerstone for the rest of the identity.</p>

<p>The benchmark of any tourism brand is how well it compliments photos of the place itself. The bold patterns, chiseled type, and saturated accent colors are great contrasts to the busy forests and waterfalls on display in these layouts, with a few more lozenges thrown in as thematically appropriate holding shapes. Any hopes I had that the illustrations would find their footing in the grand scheme of the identity are dashed here &#8211; and the muddy brown accent color paired with them in these samples aren&#8217;t doing them any favors.</p>

<p class="end">The Utcubamba Corridor has so much going for it that the old identity didn&#8217;t capture. Aventúrate Chachapoyas felt like a generic travel brand that could have been applied to any destination in South America. In rebuilding from the ground up, Studioa managed to bring unique details of this part of Peru to the forefront with remarkably few elements &#8211; honestly, if this whole identity was just the typeface, it still would have won me over. Every part of this identity feels intentional and drawn from some real aspect of the location and culture (even the illustrations, in subject if not style). The Mundo Chachapoyas identity really draws you into its world.</p>
