                                            <p><strong>Opinion</strong><br />
                                            While I'm still not 100% clear on what exactly Mobile World Capital Barcelona is or does and where or how it does it, I would trust it more to do <em>it</em> with the new logo over the old one, which looked more like that for a seismological center with its epicenter design and emergency-red color. The new logo hints more at technology and sound/electrical waves of some sort in an ambiguous way that conveys “technology”. I keep being thrown off by the name of the organization… I guess it's more about “mobility” in terms of “moving” humanity forward as opposed to mobile technology that you carry with you. Then there is “World Capital”, meaning it's an organization with global scope but then it's punctuated by “Barcelona” meaning it's hyper local so it's hard, at least for me, to make a connection of what any of it has to do with the logo, which, to its credit, has a very nicely executed circle made up of elliptical shapes and a neat sans serif wordmark.<span></span> The identity is enlivened by some really nice motion work for the icon animation and how it expands into messaging, which is, unfortunately, just a lot of buzzwords: Human! Vision! Future! Innovation! Still, everything looks nice and crisp in Dinamo's <a href="https://abcdinamo.com/typefaces/favorit" target="_blank">Favorit</a>. Some AI-generated imagery of people engrossed in technology provide some moody, slightly dystopian vibes that is hard to tell if they are meant to convey a warning or a promise of an even more technologically-filled future. Stylistically this would be a great nonprofit arm of <a href="https://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/new_logo_and_identity_for_deezer_by_koto.php" target="_blank">Deezer</a>. There is also a drone because drones. Overall, this is certainly an improvement of what existed before — which you can see by scrolling a couple of yards <a href="https://www.instagram.com/mwcbarcelona/" target="_blank">on their Instagram account</a> — and gives the organization a polished and contemporary presence to help its mission expand globally. From Barcelona.</p>

<h1 class="friday_likes">Copa Dorada by WIKKA</h1>
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/friday_likes_copadorada.jpg" alt="Copa Dorada by WIKKA" />

<p style="margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;"><a href="https://copadorada.cl/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Copa Dorada</a> is a coffee roaster in Atacama, Chile — fun fact: the driest nonpolar desert in the world — offering beans from around the world. The identity, designed by Mexico City- and Barcelona-based Spain <a href="https://estudiowikka.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WIKKA</a>, has a groovy, loose, and hipster-y aesthetic with a combination of wobbly, rugged typefaces (with Hobo as a “crisp” contrast) along with some purposely crude illustrations and dingbats. Naturally, comparisons to the work of <a href="https://workbyland.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Land</a> are inevitable but this still manages to have its own cool details, mainly the titular graphic that takes the classic optical illusion of a cup in the middle of two faces in profile to bring to life the name of the brand, “Golden Cup”. <a href="https://copadorada.cl/collections/all" target="_blank" rel="noopener">On Copa Dorada&#8217;s shop</a>, though, another titular illustration takes center stage, with a cracked, chipped, slightly broken chalice that is pretty cool too. They had me at Hobo to be honest. <span class="pagination_divider"></span><span class="small_caps"><a href="https://estudiowikka.com/portafolio/copadorada" target="_blank" rel="noopener">See full project</a></span></p>

<p style="margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;"><a href="https://www.donmolinico.es/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Don Molinico</a> is a Spanish brand specializing in stuffed piquillo peppers, offering them with a variety of fillings. The packaging, designed by Florence, Italy-based <a href="https://auge-design.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Auge Design</a>, is equally stuffed with goodness, starting with the elegant and bold color palette of red and gold, some excellent typography using a single font weight (<a href="https://www.myfonts.com/products/ot-cn-med-ff-supergrotesk-368921" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FF Super Grotesk Condensed Medium</a>), and, depending on your general appreciation for stuffed piquillo peppers, some delectable product photography. Like most of Auge Design&#8217;s projects, this is beautiful and, in its own way, unsurprising, but one aspect that makes it even better is <a href="https://www.google.com/search?sca_esv=ab65fc6f24c45a6f&#038;sca_upv=1&#038;sxsrf=ADLYWIKvjEEYiGeNI9t3Ud4CpG2ZZbnGxQ:1721987620456&#038;q=don+molinico&#038;udm=2&#038;fbs=AEQNm0Aa4sjWe7Rqy32pFwRj0UkWd8nbOJfsBGGB5IQQO6L3J03RPjGV0MznOJ6Likin94p8FXzmjNmbQ-4rMNC3Kdp_Ia0NJ_Xbsq2lLPyOE-5zeairq83bK3zzxZ6o0dZO30lWaKVQjrsOcdsUog-d-c7KgK-aG5SUJjTvK1LgZoWgKb_vjaAWO9pI7KTlvRzmvdH7dfZu8CdEUblp2i-H0BCPbDXuMw&#038;sa=X&#038;ved=2ahUKEwi96rLjt8SHAxVD8MkDHUsmD5MQtKgLegQIDRAB&#038;biw=1615&#038;bih=1093&#038;dpr=2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">what the brand and packaging looked like before</a> — far, far, far away from the premium look it has now.  <span class="pagination_divider"></span><span class="small_caps"><a href="https://www.behance.net/gallery/202221547/DON-MOLINICO" target="_blank" rel="noopener">See full project</a></span>

<h1 class="friday_likes">Wims! by Marc Hill</h1>
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/friday_likes_wims.jpg" alt="Wims! by Marc Hill" />

<p style="margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:30px!important;"><a href="https://wims.world/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wims!</a> is a cannabis drink mixer, packing a light 4MG THC: 4MG CBD content, that comes in tiny little packets that you can take with you wherever you go and whenever you are ready you literally crack it open and add it to any liquid base. The packaging, designed by Brooklyn, NY-based <a href="https://marcrosshill.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Marc Hill</a>, has a breezy 1980s vibe thanks to the condensed serif set at an angle — similar, not in a bad or accusing way, to <a href="https://www.vacation.inc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vacation</a> — and a hint of elegance thanks to the color palette, quality product materials, and confident, minimalist layout. On the side, an illustration of a naked man enjoying a drink (also in a chalice) adds some spiciness to the design. Probably would have been good to literally balance this out with a naked woman illustration on the other side. Still, consider me intrigued (and attracted). <span class="pagination_divider"></span><span class="small_caps"><a href="https://thedieline.com/wims-thc-drink-mix-adds-a-vintage-as-seen-on-tv-magic-to-california-sobriety/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">See full project</a></span></p>

The Ducks were founded as an expansion team for the 1993–94 season by the Walt Disney Company, and were known as the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim, a name based on the 1992 film <em>The Mighty Ducks</em>. In 2005, Disney sold the franchise to the Samuelis, who, along with then-general manager Brian Burke, changed the name of the team to the Anaheim Ducks before the 2006–07 season. The Ducks have won six Pacific Division championships, and have advanced to the Stanley Cup Finals twice, losing to the New Jersey Devils in 2003, and winning the Stanley Cup in 2007 over the Ottawa Senators, becoming the first of the three California-based teams to win the Stanley Cup.&#8221; (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anaheim_Ducks" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wikipedia</a>)</p>

                                            <p><strong>Relevant quote</strong><br /><em>Following years of deliberation and fan feedback, the Ducks are introducing a refreshed version of the classic and world-famous Ducks logo. Revolutionized by a vibrant transformation of the iconic duck mask with a refreshed twist now framed in vibrant orange as the bold primary color reflective of the team’s home in Orange County. A dynamic, aggressive orange eye in the Duck mask with a fearless expression symbolizes the evolving primary mark, a revolution to be faster, more exciting and more aggressive than ever before, both on and off the ice. The eyebrow has a more rounded, aggressive curve, marking an on-ice tenacity the team has developed over its three decades of existence and reflective of the miles of powerful Pacific Ocean rock reef and beach-break waves that crash up and down the coast.<br /><br />A return to the pinnacle of ‘90s hockey fashion, a new, powerful identity at home and on the road are not just apparel; they are an emblem of the team’s identity, embracing unexpected aggression that defines a path forward. Intended to align the club’s history, ambition and vision, a simplified design with sharper angles, clean lines and sharp contrasts were inspired by the vibrant culture, colors and energy of Orange County, elevating orange for a bold impactful look present throughout the uniforms, including the pants, helmet, socks and gloves.

                                            <p><strong>Opinion</strong><br />
                                            After bursting unto the NHL scene with the success of Disney's <em>The Mighty Ducks</em> film that led to the development of the team and with a killer logo that drove merch sales through the roof, the Ducks' <a href="https://www.sportslogos.net/logos/list_by_team/1/Mighty_Ducks_of_Anaheim" target="_blank">logo evolution</a> left a lot to be desired for after 2006 when it abandoned the duck-shaped goalie mask logo. The old logo featured an abstract “D” blended with a duck's webbed foot, which was conceptually sound if a little odd, but the execution dove into more traditional sports spiky territory that made it blend in with a hundred other sports logos. The return to the original design is no surprise given the rise of nostalgia across all industries and as a teenage of that era, there is no better nostalgia for me than 1990s nostalgia.<span></span> While this could have gone full ’90s with the original green and purple combo that permeated other sports teams at the time — like the NBA's <a href="https://www.sportslogos.net/logos/view/25682461989/Charlotte_Hornets/1989/Primary_Dark_Logo" target="_blank">Charlotte Hornets</a>, which were also a merch machine — this one turns the dial back a few more decades for a rich 1950s-esque color palette of orange, black, and gold that imbues the old logo with a new energy. The revised drawing of the goalie mask is fantastic and perfectly executed, improving on the original design tenfold. The addition of the orange eye behind the mask takes this from a funnily-scary design to a bad-ass-scary design. One awesome detail that I read about in the SportsLogos rundown is that the tape around the hockey sticks are abstract “W”s, for “Wild Wing” which is the nickname of the team's mascot.<span></span> Building on the ’50s theme is an excellent wordmark that manages to blend Mid-century aesthetics with the spiky serifs of the sports industry in a novel way. The chiseled effect is so well done too. Finally, there are the uniforms, which look amazing with all that orange and the sparks of gold and black accents. It manages to be classy and aggressive AND friendly. Overall, an excellent decision to return to one of the most iconic sports logos and not just phoning it in by dusting the old files — which I am guessing would be on an <a href="https://www.google.com/search?sca_esv=00cbfd697922c9db&amp;sca_upv=1&amp;sxsrf=ADLYWILAfGSUugPOH8Q0l7L_VH1_ND1OVQ:1721914518547&amp;q=Iomega+Zip+drive&amp;udm=2&amp;fbs=AEQNm0A2upiO_GHeTz6R89sNEjTHXSUfB8x3gweQ77S5CBNH1tzEOsaivoIUdA-AqC0ULxqEU6_JAVAk23cd09fLsdbCmU2G8PVUI1YBAgKBNZdMVjy5Rew_6rpX7F7cs3KBsJLBEw8LNMdCAbAPolj5sdsei2H220QWn8ah97wZZmzk57ie619ZXbkf51EPCUvHiPK_i5JHOUdvRg_rkiCDJr5CuSp2uQ&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjso9i5p8KHAxWBrokEHRO9BToQtKgLegQIEhAB&amp;biw=1612&amp;bih=1098&amp;dpr=2" target="_blank">Iomega Zip drive</a> — but by reviving it and restoring it for a new era and generation of fans.</p>

Its first conference attracted a very modest 1,000 attendees and it then had to move to a virtual model due to the pandemic but in 2023 it attracted 8,500 attendees at the Moscone Center in San Francisco as it returned to in-person attendance and this year, a whopping 12,000 people attended in-person along with 65,000 virtual participants. The identity for this year&#8217;s (and previous years as well) has been designed by Figma&#8217;s in-house team.</p>

<blockquote>In the brainstorming phase, we let Figma’s features the guide the way. This year, we were particularly excited about the redesigned Figma and new Figma Slides, which aim to help users work more fluidly and efficiently. Being able to switch between different modes of making—from creating to sharing work, for example—felt like a major unlock. We were inspired by this fresh way of looking at the Figma canvas, and a brand-new canvas altogether in Figma Slides. So we started sketching a shape-based language that would amplify, shift, and transform, each time showing an unanticipated perspective.<br /><br />One of the biggest challenges of an event like Config is the sheer volume of assets we need to create. We set out to create a modular system that felt variable and engaging—where everything feels cohesive, but never repetitive.</blockquote><h3><a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/config-2024-branding/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Figma blog post</a></h3>

<blockquote>Shapes have been a key motif to the Config brand over the years. So we started by creating a library of simple geometric shapes, or primitives, that came directly from the Figma toolbar—a rectangle, circle, and polygon. These humble forms are the jumping off point for anyone designing in Figma, and we wanted to make that a through line in the Config brand, where they become the building blocks for more complex supergraphics that see each shape expanding into a new configuration. To ensure variety across all touchpoints, we built a robust component library of these supergraphics in Figma. With three variants per supergraphic, we could showcase each shape from different angles.</blockquote><h3><a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/config-2024-branding/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Figma blog post</a></h3>

<p>Since its first event — how <em>cute</em> <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/reflections-on-config-our-first-user-conference/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is this “small” gathering and modest event graphics?</a> — Config has relied on a visual language of geometric shapes <a href="https://www.google.com/search?sca_esv=8dca5a6e4fb2a16a&#038;sca_upv=1&#038;sxsrf=ADLYWIL8MepOTvHUjmmtm-9y9W2wSORJnw:1721901770051&#038;q=config+2023&#038;udm=2&#038;fbs=AEQNm0Aa4sjWe7Rqy32pFwRj0UkWd8nbOJfsBGGB5IQQO6L3J_86uWOeqwdnV0yaSF-x2jrJh7Dt5wV71ckxEPe_0GQyc61_Jkg5ZI9z4zNW20fWd52E8UO95Fa_VxoakS9zyCiAT-lUw9SqXLpdCTRHyZ2TB397CTLvedOJGxV_D_7JRzn827oY3wzpySThiJ8JihGoKqQR2_EkH-yaVIj8nLqyaR61pA&#038;sa=X&#038;ved=2ahUKEwjL9d3698GHAxV4G9AFHSnaBaQQtKgLegQIJhAB&#038;biw=1612&#038;bih=1098&#038;dpr=2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">with last year&#8217;s event</a> beginning to hint at a more comprehensive and expandable system that could adapt to digital and physical applications at scale but this year was more ambitious both in terms of its application but also in terms of the core design system driving all of it. Using a mere three shapes that  came directly from the Figma toolbar — a rectangle, circle, and a polygon — the team combined them into a flurry of snowflake-like compositions where no two are the same thanks to the multiple combinations afforded by the broad color palette. The resulting “supergraphics”, as they call them, are fun, energetic, and visually-pleasing building blocks for both motion and static uses.</p>

<blockquote>As we developed our graphic language, we simultaneously explored a motion language based on our four core principles: [Shift, Transform, Amplify, and Activate.] With such a wide range of modes, a systematic approach to motion was essential. Custom animations for every surface would have been much too unrealistic. Instead, we built a motion library of interchangeable parts, enabling us to create varied compositions in different color palettes. This versatile motion library allowed us to infuse animation into every experience.</blockquote><h3><a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/config-2024-branding/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Figma blog post</a></h3>

<p>It&#8217;s hard to tell the four different motion behaviors — shift, transform, amplify, and activate — apart but when experiencing them as the end-user it really doesn&#8217;t matter. The important thing is how smooth and hypnotic these are and how they cleverly add depth and dimension to the flat graphics. It&#8217;s also pretty cool to see how the compositions can range from relatively minimalist to un-relatively dense and chaotic and still maintain the same overall vibe without feeling like it&#8217;s jumping the shark. The system also adapts quite elegantly to the giant, extra wide, main stage screens as seen below that help keep the backgrounds active and engaging throughout presentations and panels.</p>

<blockquote>Just like designing a product, creating an immersive and engaging conference requires a deep understanding of your audience, a clear vision, and a system that can flex to meet the needs of every touchpoint. For us, that meant considering the needs of our attendees, designing a system that could scale from the digital to the physical, from the expressive to the functional. By establishing a clear design language—made up of primitives, supergraphics, color palettes, and motion principles—we created a foundation that could adapt to the unique opportunities and constraints of each surface.</blockquote><h3><a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/config-2024-branding/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Figma blog post</a></h3>

<blockquote>When translating our digital language to a physical experience, we focused on adding dimension, material, and contrast. In our central Makers’ Space, we permuted our shapes into physical, large-scale structures. Attendees used them as seating, photo backdrops, and as a place to meet. Several levels above, attendees encountered a hanging installation of 14 multi-color box kites, some as large as 17 feet, as they entered the event. We partnered with <a href="https://www.onehatonehand.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">One Hat One Hand</a> to craft these kites, taking our flat supergraphics into new dimensions. Every level of Moscone offered its own, distinct vantage point from which to view these floating manifestations of our brand. Another pleasant discovery: These structures also reflected some of our animation moves, where shapes rotate into unexpected profiles.</blockquote><h3><a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/config-2024-branding/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Figma blog post</a></h3>

<p>Needless to say, where this identity goes to 11 is in the physical applications that transform the insanely big Moscone Center into a temporary mini Figma universe on every surface of its 2-millon-square-feet surface. (Fact-check: I really don&#8217;t know if they took over <em>all</em> of the Moscone Center but even just a fraction is an inordinate amount of space.) For the 2022 Brand New Conference in Austin we wanted to cover some big-ass columns with our identity and after getting an estimate for the cost we were like “no thank you” so I can&#8217;t even imagine what it cost to cover so much of the exteriors and interiors in Config&#8217;s supergraphics system. I guess Adobe&#8217;s $1 billion breakup fee after terminating their $20 billion merger agreement had to go somewhere — tell the Brand New subscribers I am jealous without telling them I am jealous. </p>

<p>Kidding aside, this is astoundingly impressive not just for the scale but for the smart and striking adaptation of the visual system to the myriad of surfaces available in “flat” mode as well as the extrusion of the system into structural designs that not only look amazing but that are functional meeting, resting, and charging (literally as some of these have plugs) points for the attendees. These structures further convert the space into a Figma playground offering non-stop Figma indoctrination for an already captive audience — and I mean this in the most positive of ways. As impressive as they are, the kites by <a href="https://www.onehatonehand.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">One Hat One Hand</a> are perhaps the one element that feels off-brand… it feels like the shape system is being forced to do something it&#8217;s not as naturally wont to do. Perhaps it&#8217;s all the wood framing for them that makes them feel <em>too</em> analog. Still, as mentioned, impressive.</p>

<p class="end">Overall, this is a fantastic design system and just the right amount of bonkers for a one-time application — meaning, something like this would be exhausting to execute on the client&#8217;s end and to experience on the user&#8217;s end if applied to a brand long-term — that goes all out to envelop its audience in a cohesive, expressive, and relevant visual language for two full days.</p>
