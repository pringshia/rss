Will be interesting what twist the logo and campaign take next Tuesday when Harris is expected to announce her VP pick.

                                            <p><strong>Relevant quote</strong><br /><em>Our design plan led us to propose a logo that would show the brand name in a simple and legible way and give prominence to a character: Aoki. He would be in charge of accompanying customers to navigate the nature and benefits of the financial product. In addition, we defined a noble color palette that would stand out in the stores; a typeface family that would force us to write clearly and write little; and a visual system that seeks to break the grids and the squares that the financial industry can sometimes be.

                                            <p><strong>Opinion</strong><br />
                                            
Just for some quick context in case you skipped the intro or if it wasn't the most clear: Oka provides installment payments for purchases made at <a href="https://hiraoka.com.pe/" target="_blank">Hiraoka</a>, a large appliance retailer in Peru, so you can see where the name came from. Rocking <a href="https://www.myfonts.com/products/ultra-bold-gill-sans-342853" target="_blank">Gill Sans Ultra Bold</a>, I am surprised (and perhaps a little bit saddened) that the new logo didn't also just chip away from the old logo like the name did and use the “OKA” part as it also provided the counterspaces to hide the oval-shaped mascot within. The actual wordmark they went with is a little clunky unfortunately as it tries a little too hard to customize the letterforms with the “a” ending up disproportionate and the counter of the “o” too big. Another approach could have perhaps been a strictly geometric wordmark with a single-story “a”. Anyway, enough what-ifs. It's a… wait for it… okay logo.<span></span> The jelly-bean-shaped mascot is fun and endearing and I really like its claymation-like texture and lo-fi animation. I like the concept of contrasting its 3D body-torso-head with vector limbs but it would have been nice for said limbs to be a little less generic and default-y. I also like the premise of the mascot pushing regular rectangles into pliable polygons that can then interact with typography and imagery. <a href="https://typetype.org/fonts/tt-firs-neue/" target="_blank">TT Firs</a> is an okay choice… it might be a little too harsh and corporate and it doesn't pair particularly well when used with the logo as part of a sentence. The color palette is fun and vibrant and the few applications shown are definitely eye-catching. Overall, some more refined and/or playful design decisions could have been made but this has some fun and clever ideas going for it as well as a solid physical presence in a retail environment.</p>

                                            <p>Some subtle yet soulful design approaches this week for two restaurants and a hotel with work from New York (twice) and Medellín.</p>
<span id="more-296575"></span>

<h1 class="friday_likes">The Henson by Saint Urbain</h1>
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/friday_likes_thehenson.jpg" alt="The Henson by Saint Urbain" />

<p style="margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;"><a href="https://www.thehenson.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Henson</a> is a 16-room boutique hotel in the Catskills area of New York State, known for its abundant and dense nature that serves as an escape to many of New York City&#8217;s dwellers. The identity, designed by <a href="https://www.sainturbain.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Saint Urbain</a>, takes a cue from the natural surroundings to create a charming set of illustrations that live across the applications with a delicate and charming flower-slash-plant — spoiler: I&#8217;m no botanist so I have no idea what exactly it is — serving as the primary graphic identifier for the hotel. It accompanies a rather nice chiseled-like sans serif that is chunky and tightly set. I usually don&#8217;t like the treatment where half of the serifs point one way and half the other way but here it somehow works. The wordmark manages to look good stacked, in one line, and on a curve (not shown above but yes at the link). The color palette, material choices, and all around charm of the space most definitely beckon for a visit. <span class="pagination_divider"></span><span class="small_caps"><a href="https://www.sainturbain.com/work/the-henson/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">See full project</a></span></p>

<h1 class="friday_likes">Matilda by Saint Urbain</h1>
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/friday_likes_matilda.jpg" alt="Matilda by Saint Urbain" />

<p style="margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:60px!important;"><a href="https://www.matildacatskills.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Matilda</a> is the cozy, fine dining restaurant within The Henson, helmed by chefs Jeremiah Stone and Fabian von Hauske Valtierra offering local fare. The identity, also designed by Saint Urbain, extends the aesthetic sensibility of the hotel&#8217;s identity through a series of illustrations with a jovial rabbit leading the way. This one accompanies another really nice wordmark but this time it&#8217;s all in lowercase. I don&#8217;t usually repeat designers on Friday Likes but this is a fun case of two separate but similar identities that perhaps could have been shown as one but that each have subtleties worth singling out. One small detail that I really like is that if you look at the color palette on the labels of the shower toiletries of The Henson, the dark blue of Matilda would be a perfect fourth companion. Also, whereas in The Henson the spot illustrations are all used independently, one at a time, Matilda&#8217;s library of illustrations can come together as a pattern, as they do on the napkins. Overall, a handful of details that make the two identities co-exist so well together but where each can also stand on its own, providing a double allure to head to the mountains. <span class="pagination_divider"></span><span class="small_caps"><a href="https://www.sainturbain.com/work/matilda-restaurant/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">See full project</a></span>

<h1 class="friday_likes">Hijo de Tigre by Invade Design</h1>
<img decoding="async" src="https://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/friday_likes_hijodetigre.jpg" alt="Hijo de Tigre by Invade Design" />

<p style="margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:30px!important;"><a href="https://www.instagram.com/_hijodetigre/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hijo de Tigre</a> is a restaurant and wine bar in Medellín, Colombia, offering an eclectic selection of dishes. The name is based on the saying “hijo de tigre, sale pintado” that translates literally as “Son of a tiger, comes out painted”… basically, “like father, like son”. The identity, designed by local firm <a href="https://www.invade.design/hijodetigre" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Invade Design</a>, is also an eclectic collection of design elements, starting with the delightful and subtly bad-ass logo of a tiger and its son (that is half human half feline) with his legs blending beautifully into the stripes, bringing the saying to life. Around it, the name of the establishment shows up in different ways, whether it&#8217;s a straightforward sans serif or a more ornate interpretation with curls on some of the letters. As a weird but welcome bonus there are some oil-painting-like portraits (which look to be AI-generated) of tiger ancestors and they are pretty funny. The interiors — a few of which can also be appreciated on the restaurant&#8217;s <a href="https://www.instagram.com/_hijodetigre/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Instagram account</a> — by sister firm, <a href="https://www.behance.net/interno" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Interno</a>, are sublime and I would go there just to take a picture of that tile work. <span class="pagination_divider"></span><span class="small_caps"><a href="https://www.invade.design/hijodetigre" target="_blank" rel="noopener">See full project</a></span></p>

                                            <p><strong>Relevant quote</strong><br /><em>Our brand idea — Immersive excellence — is compelling to both athletes and the general public alike, whilst being a tangible promise that is both performance-led and benefit-led. It drives the athletes and their teams to be the best they can be, whilst also opening the sport up to broader audiences, inviting them to get excited, show support or even be inspired to take the plunge themselves and get involved in aquatic disciplines. It’s an idea that encapsulates what the business and brand needs to deliver.<br /><br />To bring our brand idea to life we created an identity system inspired by the free-flowing, organic forms of water. This direction was weaved throughout all elements of the brand; from the GB splash logo, to the drip inspired typeface, aqueous colours and fluid patterns.<br /><br />The system itself also had to be fluid in order to flex and adapt across the full range of disciplines whilst also working with event partners and sponsors. It had to have the ability to resonate with athletes and inspire and excite audiences, whilst also having the authority of a National Governing Body.</em></p>

                                            <p><strong>Opinion</strong><br />
                                            <a href="https://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/new_name_and_logo_for_aquatics_gb.php" target="_blank">Spotted earlier this year</a>, the logo already got a few reactions with the splashy “GB” monogram earning a majority of “Great” votes, which I found a little surprising as I think it's an awkward design, especially for a governing body of Olympic sports, given how overly playful it is. I think it would be great for an amusement water park or a line of vacation-y swimwear but to represent top athletes in Great Britain, it seems a little too informal. Design-wise, I obviously get that it evokes water and making a literal splash but the resulting letterforms are, at least to me, somewhat off-putting. The wordmark, typeset in <a href="https://processtypefoundry.com/fonts/sculpin/" target="_blank">Sculpin</a>, is a harsh contrast with its sharp angles so there is also an odd relationship between those two elements. Nonetheless, it's still a far more engaging, interesting, and memorable logo than what they had before, with an icon that looked like <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/sco/thumb/4/42/British_Airways_Logo.svg/1280px-British_Airways_Logo.svg.png" target="_blank">the British Airways icon</a> flew out the cabin mid-flight.<span></span> The identity doubles down on the splash-y gestures with a series of swirly graphics that evoke water and ripples. They work best when they are red, blue, and white on a dark blue vs. the monotone approach as it starts to look like when oil spills on a puddle of water and you get that iridescent swirly effect. The combination of those with the silhouetted photography seems like it was a good idea on paper but the faux shadows and the context-less athletes looks odd. Going further down the unconventional path, the primary typeface is <a href="https://zarmatype.com/font/monigue/" target="_blank">Monigue</a>, which is cool and funky on its own but slightly out of place in this context. The typeface is particularly nice in its lowercase but that is missed in the all caps approach here and… well… a lot of those uppercase letters are just very uncomfortable. The few applications shown feel like the elements are forced together and despite it all being graphically flow-y, it doesn't quite flow. Perhaps the best application is the uniform set, with the graphics blocked out across the chest area. Overall, this may have one too many water-y gestures going on at once and too many typographic styles competing for attention but it is certainly lively and energetic.</p>

                                            <p>Established in 1914, <a href="https://www.speedo.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Speedo</a> is an Australian-British distributor of swimwear and swim-related accessories — purportedly, the world’s leading swimwear brand, available in more than 170 countries. Founded originally as Fortitude by a young Scot, Alexander MacRae, who migrated to Australia in 1910, the the company gained traction with the success of one of his first products: The Racerback, the world’s first non-wool suit. The company adopted the Speedo name in 1927 through an internal staff contest and as it went on to spearhead the swim brief revolution, “Speedo” has become a genericized trademark to refer to any small, tight, banana-hammock-esque, racing brief. Over the decades, Speedo has innovated across swim categories ranging from the famous briefs to bodyskin swimsuits to goggles to caps and has become the sponsor of several national swim teams and/or their competition wear provider. To coincide with the Paris Olympics and to re-engage with all swim audiences —  from performance to lifestyle and from young to old — Speedo has introduced a new identity designed by <a href="https://www.anomaly.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Anomaly</a>.</p>
<span id="more-296531"></span>
<blockquote>Speedo is THE swim brand. Whilst it continues to dominate pools with its unrivalled expertise, over the years it has lost its emotional connection and cultural relevance, focusing more on distribution and merchandise. 2024 marks the opening of the Paris Olympics 2024, and a transformation for the brand. Led by Anomaly, the total brand overhaul engages all swim audiences, putting the swimmer at the heart of the brand, and transforming its codes to communicate its deep knowledge, expertise and love for swim culture across all brand touchpoints.</blockquote><h3>Anomaly provided text</h3>

<figcaption>Samples of old identity.</figcaption>
</figure>

<blockquote>The next evolution of Speedo&#8217;s logo needed to sustain a common DNA with its predecessor but be crafted for a more digital future fit. As a category leader precision was needed within evolution. The wordmark was deliberately engineered to perform and stretch its performance credentials, crafted to ‘perform’ on swimwear fabric and products, with shortened ascenders and descenders and streamlined curves. The boom icon was streamlined and optically attuned to the wordmark, resulting in two elements that swim and support each other perfectly.</blockquote><h3>Anomaly provided text</h3>

<p>With such a ubiquituous logo, it makes sense that this is an evolution and for the most part it&#8217;s a beneficial one that, well, speeds up the logo with a more pronounced slant and a more dynamic “S”. The width of the letters is a little off though, with the “p”, “e”s, and “d” looking quite wide, leaving the “o” to look smaller. It&#8217;s not an overt disproportion but it&#8217;s there if you stare at it for long enough. The shorter descender and ascender on the “p” and the “d” are a nice touch that makes the type look more compact and aerodynamic while their gooey connection between stem and bowl is akin to their swimwear stretching and adapting to the body. It&#8217;s fun to learn the nickname of the icon, “the Boom”, and its update is decent, making it a little smaller and tighter. Not the most exciting of logo evolutions but not a detriment either.</p>

<blockquote>Tasked with revitalising the previously inconsistent and overlooked branding of Speedo, Anomaly utilised the design idea, “for the love of swim”, throughout. Celebrating Movement and expression in all of its forms; life, positivity, growth and abundance throughout their designs:<br /><br />&#8211; An evolved wordmark and icon, built to stretch and perform on the swimwear<br />&#8211; Using swim forms to inspire a bespoke typeface<br />&#8211; Anomaly was inspired by a piece of research that identified a specific shade of green that is most visible underwater. We created a new iconic brand colour for Speedo blending the green with &#8216;medal gold&#8217;.<br />&#8211; A system inspired by the language of pool shapes and the grids found in pool tiling. <br />&#8211; A bespoke typographic style that feels trusted and knowledgeable yet modern and distinctive through the use of mixed fonts, inspired by swimming forms.</blockquote><h3>Anomaly provided text</h3>

<p>Unfortunately, the case study and assets provided are not the most comprehensive or beneficial to get a good sense of the new identity, so we have to make do with the glimpses we get at it through the overview above and the intro video towards the end of the review. The newest addition to the identity is a custom typeface that is “made of swim”, which I am not exactly sure what that means and while it looks like a fun sans serif I do not feel immersed in swim when I see it. It reminds me a bit of <a href="https://polytype.co.uk/spoof" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Spoof</a>, which is one of my personal favorites so despite my reluctance to accept its swim-ability, I do like it. The color palette is led by a new green color that blends green with the gold of a medal, which basically yields a tennis ball green, which is perfectly nice and fun. This is complemented by a muted red and That Blue so the brightness and contrast across the three colors is a bit off but, somehow, makes for a nice trio.</p>

<figcaption>Identity introduction video.</figcaption>

<p>Not a whole lot in application but there is some promising-looking stuff in the video above, particularly the packaging at the 1:24 mark, that has some cool layouts. There is also the notion of pool lanes informing some of the applications by adopting really thin lines to break up the typography and as a design element, and while they look nice they are a bit too delicate to be reminiscent of pool lanes. I do wish this was all better presented to get a more clear look at what&#8217;s going on.</p>

<figcaption>TV spot. Not sure if it was also executed by Anomaly.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p class="end">The TV spot is fun but, other than the logo at the end, there is no hint of the new identity in there… Not that there needs to be but even the overall look, vibe, and humorous tone of it is very different from the stuff above it. Overall, a seemingly positive evolution for a big brand but its slow rollout across web and social and limited case study miss the opportunity to make it a more exciting one that truly brings home, if not necessarily the gold, at least the intended goal of making swimming exciting for all audiences (which, to its credit, the TV spot does really well). </p>
