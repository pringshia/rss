                                            <p>(Est. 1975) &#8220;It all began in 1975 at a bakery on Sunset Boulevard. Big was in, but Wally Amos dared to go small and perfected the ultimate bite-size chocolate chip cookie. He used only the best ingredients from an original family recipe to create the cookie you know and love. From there, the <a href="https://www.famousamos.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Famous Amos</a> story became a Hollywood success story. Iconic musicians and other Hollywood celebrities began singing the praises of the delicious cookies from a small bakery on Sunset. From the beginning, it was always Wally Amos’s core belief that you make a tastier cookie if you use high-quality ingredients. And that’s been our recipe for success from 1975 through today.&#8221;</p>

Now in its 50th year, the brand is launching “Famously You,” a new multi-channel initiative featuring new branding, packaging, videos and social media assets inspired by the spirit and style of its founder, Wally Amos.
<br /><br />
<strong>Famously You</strong><br /> 
Wally Amos, was a true original – a music talent agent in Hollywood, “famous” for bringing fresh baked cookies to meetings with artists and reps. In celebrating the 50th anniversary, Famous Amos is reclaiming its roots and evolving the brand: from today’s east-coast cookie-cutter-classic vibes to a cornucopia of west coast cookie energy paying homage to Wally Amos’ unmistakable personality &amp; style. The new branding includes: 
<br /> <br /> 
A simplified Famous Amos logo for better clarity and functionality across both print and digital mediums/formats.
<br /><br />
New fonts: Roko, celebrating its West coast heritage, it references 70’s-era Los Angeles and the stamps featured on the original packaging; and Sunset Script, a custom font that acts as an extension of the Famous Amos wordmark.<br /><br />
New accent colors and a library of illustrated patters paying homage to Wally Amos’ signature style of Hawaiian shirts. </em></p>

                                            <p><strong>Opinion</strong><br />
                                            I can't recall if I have ever eaten a Famous Amos cookie… they seem like something I would pick from a wicker basket during a flight where it's either that or Biscoff or some other famous-yet-not-famous brand. I also like my cookies big, not bite-sized but I know I have heard the brand name before — I just wouldn't have been able to tell you what it looked like. Despite being founded by the late <a href="https://www.af.mil/News/Article-Display/Article/125767/famous-former-airman-recalls-his-service/" target="_blank">Wally Amos</a>, known for his penchant for Hawaiian shirts — he was stationed in Hawaii when he was in the Air Force — and otherwise colorful ensembles and personality, the consumer brand was quite generic. The script logo was fine but nothing memorable or distinctive and the packaging, while also fine, could have been for any other cookie brand.<span></span> This evolution isn't as dramatic or as drastic as it could be but it's still beneficial. Removing the drop shadow from the script logo yields a slightly more elegant expression as there are no distracting and unnecessary elements, putting it closer — not close, just closer — to other script-based brands like Coca-Cola or <a href="https://www.tillamook.com/" target="_blank">Tillamook</a>. Needless to say, a redrawing of the logo by a skilled, contemporary lettering artist would have been most welcome but, for whatever reason, that wasn't the case and this is as good as it gets in the don’t-touch-the-logo category.<span></span> Given that they introduced a custom script for the identity, it seems like someone, somewhere was gunning for an update as the script clearly takes a cue from the logo but introduces a much smoother and flow-ier design. The script is pretty much the highlight of the project and it provides a great backdrop to interact with the tiny cookies. The supporting <a href="https://nuformtype.com/roko" target="_blank">Roko</a> typeface is a little too retro and I think it clashes with both the logo and the script. The addition of some Hawaiian shirt-inspired patterns is fun but with Wally out of the picture — <a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/hawaii/articles/2024-08-14/wally-amos-88-of-cookie-fame-died-at-home-in-hawaii-he-lost-famous-amos-but-found-other-success" target="_blank">he lost control of the company in the 1980s</a> as well as the right to use his own name for other products — it feels like an empty gesture to the founder.<span></span> The new packaging is fine but still operating within that generic, replaceable design frequency that is common among mainstream products — at its best, it's a lateral move. Overall, the logo, identity, and packaging all seem to be stuck somewhere between wanting to be fun and memorable and wanting to maintain some kind of status quo and brand continuity that, in the competitive cookie space, might not have the necessary impact this could have had if they had committed to a bolder change.

<p>The old logo was arguably fine given its sturdy, condensed sans serif approach but that “to” ligature was trying way too hard and not only did it not have any conceptual relevancy, it was not visually pleasant either. The period at the end was pretty gratuitous too. Replacing the old sans serif is <a href="https://www.renebieder.com/fonts/stakkat" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Stakkat</a>, a quirky and contemporary interpretation of Clarendon that features some funky ink traps and exaggerated terminals. As unique as Stakkat is, the new wordmark does feel too out-of-the-box-y and it could have used some sort of customization somewhere to make it more ownable… perhaps one subtle move would have been to get rid of the upper slabs in the “u” and tighten that spacing with the “q”; or, even as a nod to the old logo, making a “to” ligature that joins at the bottom; or, and I promise this is the last one, tilting the “o” in the same axial angle as the monogram. Enough armchair-ing though and a pat on the back for such a great find in Stakkat.</p>

<p>Operating independently is a gooey “e” monogram that also looks like an abstracted globe drawing and I dig it. The soft corners and counterspaces are very nicely resolved and give the monogram an organic, earthy aesthetic that is quite appropriate for the end goal of the organization. Looking at it makes me wonder if the ink traps in the wordmark could have been matched to the monogram&#8217;s counterspaces. (Sorry, I broke my promise above.) Its spinning animation is hypnotic and I love how it&#8217;s kind of imperfect on purpose, with a bit of a grainy and clunky 1980s TV production logo aesthetic. The two assets are great complements to each other and both are strong enough on their own to share “logo” responsibilities.</p>

<blockquote>The new identity invites you to explore an expansive world of data, with Equator as your guide. Its gridded system is made up of infinite data points, with navigational tags and expressive icons signposting the way forward. Bright highlight colours and spotlighted stories bring personality to the world of consulting, combined with a brand voice that serves as your helpful translator and friendly guide. </blockquote><h3><a href="https://www.forthepeople.agency/projects/equator" target="_blank" rel="noopener">For The People project page</a></h3>

<p>The identity revolves around Stakkat and its amazing italics that provide a slick edge to the applications when it&#8217;s mixed with the Roman style. The typography throughout all the applications is beautifully handled and I really like the instances where big headlines or short paragraphs are peppered with dingbats and pill-shaped containers with tiny monospace type inside (using <a href="https://displaay.net/typeface/azeret/azeret-mono/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Azeret Mono</a>). The color palette is great too, with a simple combination of lavender, a dark gray, and a light tan that manages to avoid traditional color choices across the many industries Equator spans: the color palette doesn&#8217;t look like a SaaS, it doesn&#8217;t look “eco”, and it doesn&#8217;t look like any specific travel destination. A supporting graphic device is an inner lavender glow on some holding shapes for photography and text, which is alright but perhaps a remnant from another design direction presented as everything else is super sharp and streamlined. It does add some nice texture and a literal softer edge, so no complaints to be honest.</p>

<p class="end">Overall, given the niche that Equator operates in — as an advisory group, a SaaS offering, a sustainability concern, and a focus on tourism — there is no pre-established set of visual cues to either fall in line with or move away from so this identity does a great job in creating its own set of unique and engaging identifiers to connect in different ways with its various (and varied) clients.</p>

For an initiative called the <a href="https://www.denvergov.org/Government/Citywide-Programs-and-Initiatives/GO-Bonds/2025-Vibrant-Denver-Bond" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2025 Vibrant Denver Bond</a> the finance department at the City and County of Denver created a logo using Canva’s generative AI feature and slapped it on stickers when they announced the initiative. (A larger view of the logo can be found <a href="https://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/sad_denver_bond_ai_logo_large.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.) A month later, at another event, the logo had been replaced with a cleaner version drawn by a human that had only one sun, had actual buildings related to Denver without alien writing on them, and had trees that didn&#8217;t look like psychedelic Russian Constructivism. Despite what you may be thinking, the typography on the AI logo was not AI but <a href="https://www.myfonts.com/products/smooth-rundeck-998418?refby=ucllc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rundeck Smooth</a>, which, yikes.</p>

But we sell something bigger. Less friction means more energy saved. So, we can help build a more energy-efficient future where we can all do more with less. By seeking out and reducing friction, we’re tackling some of the most pressing challenges of our time and creating real, sustainable change. SKF was founded in 1907. We are represented in around 130 countries, with more than 40,000 employees and 17,000 distributor locations worldwide.&#8221;</p>

                                            <p><strong>Relevant quote</strong><br /><em>The SKF logo, originally hand-painted by an employee in the early 1900s, has become a design icon discussed in design circles. The original is now being enlisted once again to help update the entire brand identity – adapted to the digital age and with a clearer focus on movement. Since 1908, the logo has only seen minor modifications, attesting to its strength and timelessness.<br /><br />The logo has also been developed into a display font, SKF Display, with the team analysing the letters of the logo and identifying the core properties by hand. This resulted in a font produced in three different weights, finalised in collaboration with the Swedish font maestro and founder of Letters from Sweden, Göran Söderström. In order to create more movement, a new, distinct motion identity has been developed permeating the entire identity, with each individual element having both a moving and a static state.

                                            <p><strong>Opinion</strong><br />
                                            It's crazy to think that this logo was designed this way in 1907 and that it has remained untouched for nearly 120 years, looking equally futuristic and retro across time and space. To be honest, I had never seen this logo before and I am obsessed by it because it is both grotesque and beautiful at the same time. Its application up to the 1990s was also amazing but things got a little too corporate and bland there towards the end. Keeping the logo was the right call and the subtle evolutions are all beneficial to yield a more balanced construction. The biggest improvement is the exaggeration of the slabs that now look more defined and establish a stronger, literal foundation for the chunky letterforms to sit on. The “K” is a slick improvement with its higher contrast in the angled strokes. I would have personally tightened the spacing between the letters for an even bolder presence but not all dreams come true.<span></span> The main attraction in the identity is the new type family, designed in collaboration with <a href="https://lettersfromsweden.se/" target="_blank">Letters from Sweden</a>, that takes the quirks of the logo and expands them into a full alphabet. The 1990s techno flyer-slash-The Designers Republic vibes are strong with this one, which translates into: It's an acquired taste. I have an instant positive reaction to it because I used to love that stuff but I acknowledge that it can be a bit overwhelming and feel out of place in the 2020s when most of the typography everywhere is a sans serif. I also worry that the headlines can overpower the logo while also making the logo feel less special now that the rest of the typography looks just like it so there is no point of contrast. The flip side to that argument is that all of the messaging is now in the same visual language as the logo, establishing a stronger link between the two.<span></span> To my concern above, the layout system and samples like the covers and some of the advertising do a good job in isolating the logo so that it stands out enough in the relatively straightforward layouts. The website provides a comprehensive look at all the elements in play, including a custom text sans serif that works quite nicely with the headline typeface. The use of That Blue is fine if perhaps a little gratuitous or unnecessary… a more normal blue would have sufficed. A low-key highlight is the copywriting — “Fighting Friction” coupled with “Move the World Forward” are much more memorable and interesting expressions of what the company does than “We make ball bearings” would be. Overall, a solid logo evolution that hopefully sticks around for another 120 years along with a vibrant and bold identity that, like the samples of previous identities across decades, feels representative of its time while being just slightly ahead of the curve.</p>

Formerly known as the Queensland Institute of Medical Research (&#8220;QIMR&#8221;), their legacy traces back to 1864. Now the team consists of over 1,000 scientists working across four key programs: Cancer research, Mental Health, Population Health, and Infection and Disease. Notably, they have pioneered treatments for skin cancer, breast cancer and recently the first brain cancer clinical trials. For the past two years, QIMR Berghofer has been working with Brisbane, Australia-based <a href="https://bigfish.design/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bigfish</a> on a rebrand and website project.</p><span id="more-305010"></span>

<blockquote>
QIMR Berghofer is a world-leading medical research institute, pioneering breakthroughs across four distinct research programs. We undertook a bold transformation of their visual identity, seamlessly unifying these programs into a cohesive brand. The result is a groundbreaking digital platform that showcases their 1,000+ scientists, labs, and research initiatives, reinforcing their global impact.
<br /><br />
After exploring many directions, we kept returning to a simple yet powerful idea: 4 areas = 4 cells, 1 institution = 1 hexagon (a key element of their historic identity). Using Voronoi mathematics to create detailed cell patterns, we created a unique logo that is simple in form but rich in scientific detail.

<figcaption>Logo exploration.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The old logo was direct and straightforward: Three stacked hexagons center-aligned over centered text. While the composition felt medical, it did not elicit anything more. Maybe it might evoke a sense of growth but that is being generous and in a modern context, not eliciting anything more is a problem when it comes to fundraising, recruitment, social outreach and, frankly, anything public-facing.</p>

<p>The new logo looks like an abstract reaction occurring on a Petri dish. I mean that as a sincere compliment. What I enjoy most about the new logo is that they did not wipe the slate clean. It must have been tempting. Instead, they saw an opportunity to transform the hexagon shape into an active and interesting graphic device. (It is also a pleasant surprise to see the range of hexagonal explorations from the design process.) The final design translates the four research areas into four cells within the container shape, which ultimately offers a foundation for the new logo. Even if it only lives as an internal nod to the scientists, it is successful. I particularly like how the simple form feels both scientific and modern without falling to common industry traps. That is not to say that this look hasn&#8217;t been done, but rather how well it works because of how much sense it makes in this context.</p>

<p>The larger left-align text in the wordmark also feels more personable. The contrasting text weights and line break help to split the awkward name into two more manageable bits. Removing &#8220;Medical Research Institute&#8221; from the name also lightens the overall visual weight of the logo.</p>

<p>The wordmark has been modified by Colophon from <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Rethink+Sans" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rethink Sans</a>, originally designed by Hans Thiessen. This alteration helps match the cell geometry. The overall change is subtle yet, individually, several letters undergo a significant change; the &#8220;Q&#8221;, &#8220;M&#8221; and &#8220;f&#8221; in particular. This makes a much more unified &#8220;QIMR&#8221; block. I am quite happy with these adjustments, since they are more than just artistic decoration but rather help balance particular lettering in the composition.</p>

<p>The set of icons nicely carry on the cell forms from the logo. I can speak from personal experience in saying that health icons can be a challenge. These are wonderfully done, and hold up well as one-color expressions. The lungs, microscope, and pill are standouts.</p>

<p>The cell patterns are based on <a href="https://mathworld.wolfram.com/VoronoiDiagram.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Voronoi</a> equations. It is fun to see the generator create the different tessellations, and the resulting patterns are quite visually impactful.</p>

<p>The photography is a collection of employees (researchers, etc.) in situ. This set feels like a small letdown. Particularly with how dark these images tend to read. I wish these felt lighter, brighter and more active. While I understand that photos of people researching things is not the most dynamic subject, I just wish these had a bit more to offer. That said, they do feel better as videos. Even slight pans add just enough motion to animate the frame.</p>

<p>The guideline image fills us in on the rest of the system. I am particularly drawn to the colors. Reds obviously emerge as the primary color in the identity ranging from Maroon to Poppy with a set of gray tones as a strong complement and a bright secondary color set that includes teal, lime, jacaranda, and green.</p>

<p>The report covers give us the first look at full compositions. They feel like a cohesive family. The common grid provides a nice structure that allows for a range of image, graphics, and text blocks to settle.</p>

<blockquote>
The website posed a different challenge—presenting hundreds of labs and thousands of researchers&#8217; work in a way that was engaging for the public and practical for the scientific community. We tackled this by designing a modular UI and interconnected UX inspired by cellular structures. This approach created a seamless, user-friendly interface that made complex research easy to navigate. Built on our powerful Tank CMS, the site ensures that QIMR’s vast research network is both accessible and adaptable for the future.

<p>The website is clearly a priority of the project. It is a really nice solution that brings together the identity system in a thoughtful and pleasant experience. The pill shape emerges as an anchor to the design and the site feels like it maximizes the shapes and colors without coming across like it is trying too hard. It is exciting because it is intuitive. And, for as much content as there is, it is quite an accomplishment.</p>

<p>The rest of the examples carry forward the same approach across the digital and physical designs. One thing I haven&#8217;t mentioned yet is the copywriting. And while it certainly plays a backseat to the visuals, it is nicely appointed throughout the pieces with an aspirational and forward-looking tone.</p>

<p class="end">In summary, this was a major overhaul. Visually, the colors and strong patterns feel like they should be the stars of the program. And to an extent they are. However, I quite appreciate the restraint that was demonstrated throughout the system. It might be easy to go hard on &#8220;innovation&#8221; but that would likely feel too commercial. This is research. And the identity does well to stay in its lane however uncharted that might be. In doing so, they found some fantastic gems to let shine. It is a solid program that visually matches the work they are already doing.
