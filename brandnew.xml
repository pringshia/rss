                                            <p>Writing for Design Week, Alec Mezzetti, Design Director at Mother Design, ponders if the era of overly cutesy, super approachable, soft-edged design and messaging is slowly coming to a close? In other words, is “<a href="https://www.creativebreakdown.blog/p/im-baby-sell-me-insurance" target="_blank" rel="noopener">I’m baby, sell me [blank]</a>” about to become “I’m grown up, explain to me in detail why I should put my trust, money, resources, and loyalty with you”? We might not be there yet but I can easily see this new era looming in 2026, especially as the economy shifts this year and every decision a consumer makes is likely to be more deliberate than before and no amount of cutesy rounded sans serifs might be the convincing argument they (I, we, you) need.

                                            <p>(Est. 2022) &#8220;<a href="https://www.izaakreich.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Izaak Reich</a>, founded by Adam Havlíček on the Zikmundov estate, continues the more than 150-year tradition and legacy of Izaak Reich, the founder of the local glassmaking dynasty from the 19th century. The concept of restoring the glassworks began to take shape at the ancient Zikmundov farm in Stare Hute in the mind of its owner, Adam Havlicek, around 2019. The initial inspiration was the accidental discovery of materials about the history of the Reich family and the former renown of the local glassworks. This story sparked the somewhat ambitious idea of reviving glassmaking where it had vanished 150 years ago and where only the name of the village &#8211; Stare Hute (i.e. the old glassworks)- served as a reminder of its past glory. The idea evolved into a plan, and over the next two years, Adam Havlicek visited numerous glassworks across Europe to determine the best technology for producing future Izaak Reich glasses. Our brand received a clear direction after a fateful meeting with Rony Plesl, a renowned Czech glass artist and designer. Adam enthusiastically agreed to Rony&#8217;s proposal to create the first Linden collection as a tribute to the old glassmakers and the Reich family.&#8221;</p>

The Untitled Sans sans-serif font and hot stamping in the colour of molten glass underline the high quality of this small glassworks. The visual style is consistently reflected in the functional and eco-friendly packaging designed by Jan Činčera, the company's printed materials, leaflets and certificates, right through to the bespoke e-commerce website.

                                            The relationship between the wordmark and the monogram with the product is instantly and efficiently clear: The thin, delicate, beautifully-crafted aesthetic of the glassware is effortlessly translated into the high-contrast sans serif approach that emulates the thinness of the bowls of the glasses with the thicker stems. Simple, elegant, and effective, especially in the wordmark. The monogram… I understand what they were going for in trying to reproduce the silhouette of a tall glass of wine (as well as trying to pull off an “IR” combination) but the long stem of the “I”-slash–“R” feels kind of silly, leaving the bowl and leg of the “R” awkwardly and stiffly floating in the air. Maybe I'm alone in my lack of appreciation for it.<span></span> The identity is perfectly cued towards an affluent consumer base, exuding a sense of luxury and attention to detail, focusing on copper as the primary brand color and some elegant, centered layouts. The supporting muted mint color used on the website is a great complement to the copper too. The packaging does a good job in not letting this be totally ostentatious by using the ever-humble kraft box with copper foil stamping as the sole hint of luxury although that die-cut that nestles the glasses and the no-glue locking mechanism is probably a more expensive flex than foil. Overall, a lovely and elegant identity that matches the 60-Euro price point per glass that is above and beyond my red SOLO cup budget.</p>

                                            <p>Launched in 2025, <a href="https://moremud.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mud™</a> is a new dog care brand in the UK offering an everyday wash free of gimmicky smells that celebrates dogs being dogs in all their filthy, smelly glory. Created by London, UK-based graphic designer <a href="https://angelinapischikova.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Angelina Pischikova</a> and London-based art director and brand strategist <a href="https://cocarinne.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Karina Zhukovskaya</a>, mud™ is a response to a culture that has, partly, turned dogs into accessories and that, as the founders say, are presented “spotless, well-behaved, highly aesthetic dogs” on social media as opposed to accepting them as the animals they are that like to “roll in dead things, eat trash, and lick your face right after” — I would also add, from personal experience, eating their own vomit. It also acknowledges the fact that dogs&#8217; sense of smell is insanely more sensitive than humans&#8217; so their 300 million scent receptors are seriously overwhelmed by washes that smell like tutti frutti. In development since 2023, the resulting wash is pH-balanced, odor-neutralizing, and made with natural, plant-based ingredients including oat, aloe, and panthenol that smells like absolutely nothing. Given the background of the two founders, the whole brand was created in-house.</p>

<blockquote>mud™ is a small act of rebellion against the sanitised world of modern pet care. The brand embraces the mess and its visual identity reflects that. The logo reacts to the weather—expanding with rain, contracting in the dry—just like the mud under their paws. The mud™ thermal-ink bottle mimics the cycle. When wet, the logo vanishes like dirt washing off a dog, then reappears as it dries. A metaphor for the mess, the rinse, and the return to it.</blockquote><h3>mud™ provided text</h3>

<p>As the owner of not one, not two, not three but four dogs, none of which are primed to be social media influencers, this project speaks to me and makes me feel seen for the amount of assault on my senses, emotions, and personal space that these dogs unleash on me every single day. I love them. Starting with the name, you know this brand is going to be different. Rather than being named after a possible solution to the problem, it&#8217;s named after the problem: Mud. By doing so it flips the script and encourages dog owners to literally embrace the mud and the subtle hints of dirt, dead worms, and old leaves that give your dogs that particular smell they have but also metaphorically as a way to embrace the fact that dogs are dogs.</p>

<p>The logo, unlike any other care brand out there — be it for dogs or humans — is also the opposite of what you would expect. Instead of crisp and elegant to denote a fresh start, the mud™ logo is blobby, gooey, dirty, and, despite being three short letters, teeters on unreadability in some of its variations. I love how the concept revolves around the nature of mud that, as it gets wet it expands and oozes and just makes a bigger mess with the more water there is. It&#8217;s such a simple logo and idea but the execution is so rich and textural that you get the best of both worlds: clean and dirty.</p>

<p>The one odd thing so far is the more oily 3D renderings… which feel very synthetic and kind of go against the more natural theme and aesthetic of the logo. In general the 3D approach seems unnecessary and I would rather see more play with grungy, dirty textures.</p>

<figcaption>Mini packaging. The bottle is printed with thermal ink that reacts to temperature change.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The packaging for the regular size and mini bottles is great… going with a minimalist, deadpan approach that is accentuated by the grunginess of the logo. The color of the bottle, a dark tan, would be off-putting under normal circumstances as a wash product but, along with everything else, it works beautifully within this imperfect, unpolished realm. For the mini bottles, the logo is printed using thermal ink so when heat — warm water in this case — is applied to it, the logo disappears just like mud being slowly washed away. On the packaging we also get a glimpse of what has to be the best part of this project: the tone of voice. On the front it reads “For dirty dogs” and on the back it proudly states “Tested on Animals. They love it.” Both lines are so good in different ways but, most importantly, they establish mud™ as a brand that challenges conventions and expectations.</p>

<p class="end">The rest of the applications shown above and the product&#8217;s website are a masterclass in copywriting and a fantastic example of dialing into a very specific tone of voice that, rather than being repetitive and formulaic, allows the brand to speak consistently. It knows its enemy, it knows its benefits, it knows its point of differentiation (or unique selling proposition if you will), it knows how to speak to dog owners, and it knows how to command attention. Like… “Dogs want chaos, not chamomile”? and “Filth is freedom”? Just stop, it&#8217;s too much, too good. Even the devil-possessed photos of the dogs at night are fitting. Overall, if it wasn&#8217;t evidently clear by now, I love this… it&#8217;s raw, it&#8217;s honest, it&#8217;s properly targeted to a specific type of dog owner, and it&#8217;s all executed with evident joy, passion, and, most importantly, a love for dogs and all their nasty habits.</p>

                                            <p><strong>Relevant quote</strong><br /><em><strong>Logo evolution: familiar foundations, bold new energy</strong><br />
We evolved the Grubhub logo to strike the perfect balance: recognizable enough to maintain trust, bold enough to lead the category forward.
<br /><br />
A subtle increase in the wordmark’s weight signals appetite and confidence, taking up more space than before. We preserved familiar proportions to honor our existing brand equity, while refining key details—like the spur on the “G” and a tightened crossbar—for sharper legibility and a more modern finish.
<br /><br />
Built for motion as much as static use, the refreshed wordmark opens up playful, dynamic applications—giving Grubhub a more modern, vibrant, and humanistic voice in every moment.<br /><br />
<strong>Choosing the color palette and core orange</strong><br />
Grubhub has embraced orange since 2021—and it’s become a core part of the brand’s DNA. The NEW! orange takes it further: bolder, brighter, and built to stand out. With stronger contrast and greater vibrancy, it cuts through across every touchpoint. We built a full color system around it, amplifying its presence and pairing seamlessly with our food imagery to create a brand experience that’s cohesive, appetizing, and impossible to ignore.
<br /><br />
<strong>Selecting the typeface</strong><br />
We needed a typeface that could carry the spirit of Grubhub: modern, friendly, and full of character. Our chosen sans serif blends shapely elegance with a slightly unconventional design, bringing just the right mix of sophistication and playfulness.
<br /><br />
Its generous x-height and smooth curves create a warm, approachable feel, making every interaction effortless and inviting. Built as a variable font, Bagoss flexes across widths and weights—perfect for animation, motion, and every fast-moving brand moment.
<br /><br />
The result is typography that’s distinctive, adaptable, and unmistakably Grubhub.
<br /><br />
<strong>Forward-facing visual identity</strong><br />
Grubhub’s new identity is designed for the future—bold, dynamic, and adaptable. The logo evolution enhances strength and legibility, while playful motion ensures the brand stays vibrant and modern. The new orange strikes the right balance of legacy and fresh energy, making an immediate impact.<br /><br />
The Grubhub ‘G’ acts as a flexible visual anchor, cropped and used as a framing device, background, and type ribbon, keeping the brand versatile across touchpoints. The Bagoss typeface seamlessly adapts across digital, motion, and print, adding warmth and sophistication to every interaction.</em></p>

                                            Since I have never used Grubhub I don't know how much the old fork-knife-house icon was used but, at least on their main website, it was/is nowhere to be found, which is not entirely surprising given that <a href="https://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/new_logos_for_grubhub_and_seamless.php" target="_blank">the icon was handed down from the parent company</a> (Just Eat Takeaway) that acquired it and Grubhub had <a href="https://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/new_logo_and_identity_for_grubhub_by_wolff_olins.php" target="_blank">a relatively recognizable wordmark </a>in place already. Designed in 2016 by Wolff Olins, it wasn't anything particularly exciting but it was perfectly fine and the condensed sans serif with ever so slightly curved corners had just enough personality.<span></span> The new logo sticks to the condensed proportions but infuses it with a subtle, warmer human touch, particularly notable in the curvy leg of the “R” and the spur of the “G” for a less mechanical look. It's a handsome and friendly wordmark and a nice way of signaling its newfound in/dependence as <a href="https://about.grubhub.com/news/wonder-announces-acquisition-of-grubhub/" target="_blank">Just Eat Takeaway sold Grubhub to Wonder for $650 million</a>, so the old icon had to go.<span></span> The curvier “G” now serves as the foundation for the design system by scaling it, like, a 1000% and using it as a bold graphic anchor in the layouts to place silhouetted photography or messaging on top of it… it's actually a rather nice graphic device to build layouts around. The choice of <a href="https://displaay.net/typeface/bagoss-collection/" target="_blank">Bagoss</a> is solid, as it manages to be both a nice contrast in width with the logo and a nice complement in its similar Grotesque gestures. Overall, a friendly and energetic update but, for the majority of customers, it might not be enough to make a difference in Grubhub's standing behind DoorDash and Uber Eats but you have to start somewhere!</p>

From what I can tell, their offering serves both consumers and insurance providers, using new technologies to simplify the processes of purchasing and modifying policies and handling claims. There isn&#8217;t much history to expand upon here, except that they&#8217;ve recently moved from an early funding series into a new one, thanks in part to a new identity designed by Bristol, UK&#8217;s <a href="https://taxistudio.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Taxi Studio</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
The brandmark had to echo the playful spirit of Yoloh while reinforcing its commitment to making life easier. Taxi Studio’s solution was to build a logo that could be read both ways, turning the name ‘Yoloh’ into an ambigram, perfectly capturing the essence of Insurance Dejumbled. Accompanied by the strapline “Making life easier, whichever way you look at it.”

<p>It&#8217;s really not fair to even discuss the old logo, as it was probably only seen by a very minuscule number of people, and the new identity represents the true launch of this product. It&#8217;s also not fair in the sense that taking jabs at it would be like shooting fish in a barrel, which is to say that it is objectively bad. Everything about it is virtually inexplicable, from the slashes through the “Y” and “L”, to the yellow “H’, to the anatomically awkward cartoon dog MaX. So let&#8217;s say no more.</p>

<p>Clearly the new logo is a vast improvement, and &#8220;vast&#8221; is vastly understating it. The ambigram of the name is so obvious that it&#8217;s almost impossible to conceive that it wasn&#8217;t part of how they chose it, but seemingly it wasn&#8217;t. So I&#8217;m sure Taxi Studio latched onto the idea of an ambigram early on, and I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if the visual conceit of &#8220;whichever way you look at it&#8221; didn&#8217;t inform the brand strategy, rather than the strategy informing the ambigram. Either way, it&#8217;s a lovely coincidence for a brand that is seeking to bring clarity to a complicated industry. And the execution of it, while a bit trendy with its <a href="https://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/the_year_in_review_part_2_recurring_trends_2024.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gooey corners</a> and ink traps, is finely crafted in its ambigramic symmetry and successfully conveys a friendly and approachable personality.</p>

<p>However, there does seem to be some confusion about the capitalization of the name, which is all caps but now has an all-lowercase logo—even the press release refers to the company as Yoloh, not YOLOH. Maybe that&#8217;s all beside the point, but I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s an accident that the all-caps company name is a reference to the more-than-a-decade-old YOLO hashtag/acronym, begging the question, what does the H stand for? Given the other key part of this identity, let&#8217;s guess that the H stands for Hand.</p>

<blockquote>
To inject some much-needed personality into the insurance world, Yoloh needed more than just a logo. It needed a guide that could speak directly to customers. Enter Andi, the digital assistant with four digits and plenty of charm. A quirky, helpful character, Andi communicates with animated hand signals, making complex insurance terms and concepts easier to understand. Andi is a diligent, friendly guide who brings warmth and accessibility to a traditionally uninspiring industry.

<figcaption>Andi&#8217;s many hand gestures.</figcaption>
</figure>


<p>Andi, the &#8220;digital assistant&#8221; who works as a sort of mascot for the company, is a disembodied aqua-colored hand that is almost always paired with the logo in some way, and shows up almost everywhere else as well. I assume it&#8217;s named Andi because it&#8217;s handy, but I would love to hear more from Taxi Studio about why it looks the way it does. It is, for me, highly reminiscent of the Genie&#8217;s hands and gold bracelets from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aladdin_(1992_Disney_film)" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Aladdin</a>, and maybe a genie is apt, given the magical &#8220;dejumbling&#8221; of messaging and wish fulfillment of a simpler, more human way to deal with insurance. The execution of it doesn&#8217;t entirely sit well with me, though. It&#8217;s too blobby and squishy in some places, looking more like a rubber glove full of mashed potatoes. And the dejumbling animation is too frenetic, making it feel more complicated than they want to convey it is. I also can&#8217;t help thinking if they had just started with confusing insurance jargon and had Andi change it—with the wave of a hand—to clear, understandable language, that would have more meaning for their audience. Instead we&#8217;re given the less impactful gimmick of Andi dejumbling anagrams.</p>

<blockquote>
Taxi Studio turned insurance industry norms on their head by infusing Yoloh’s visual identity with fresh, distinctive colour combinations. Navy serves as a distinctive anchor, while Andi’s animated presence is brought to life in striking aqua, with yellow accents to highlight key details. The playful colours bring energy to an otherwise monochromatic category.

<p>Looking at the other parts of the system, it all delivers nicely on the humanistic vibe of the brand system. A baseline corporate navy blue is supplemented with some bright accents and soft pastels. The chunky, friendly headline typeface <a href="https://typeverything.com/bunch" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bunch Bold</a> corresponds logically with the logo and is paired nicely with the harder working geometric sans serif <a href="https://displaay.net/typeface/jokker/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jokker</a> (although I might prefer a slightly heavier weight of Jokker for better contrast and legibility). The linear icons aren&#8217;t particularly inspired but do the job. And given almost everything in this case study is moving, it&#8217;s worth noting that motion was clearly a significant consideration when developing the character of the brand, and it all has a fun, springy quality that never veers too far into the cartoonish.</p>

<p>There isn&#8217;t much in application to discuss. What we have to go by is all fairly notional but all capably done, and like the constituent brand elements it all adheres to the central conceit to be clear, accessible, and useful. And looking beyond the website mockup below to <a href="https://www.yoloh.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">their actual website</a>, it seems they&#8217;re executing on the brand system effectively.</p>

<p>Once you get past the overwhelming improvement from the old logo to the new, this brand system pretty much adheres to the playbook for a tech company looking to disrupt a traditionally inhuman industry with a more human and approachable offering. Which isn&#8217;t a dig. The insurance industry could use some humanity, but it does still have to look professional and reliable, and this brand delivers that balance well, even if there&#8217;s a bit too much Andi for my taste.</p>

<p>While giving the logo some final reflection, I have to acknowledge that ambigrams are probably more effective in physical media, where their orientation might be organically seen upside down. In a digital space, an ambigram has to rely on <em>showing</em> that it can be flipped, or that the viewer will see it in their mind&#8217;s eye. In that way, it maybe loses some of its potency, but how could they not go for it? You Only Live Once-isH.</p>
